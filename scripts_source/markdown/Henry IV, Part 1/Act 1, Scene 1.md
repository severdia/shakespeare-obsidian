## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Enter the King Henry, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmorland, Sir Walter Blunt, with others.*

**KING.**
==1==So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
==2==Find we a time for frighted peace to pant
==3==And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
==4==To be commenc’d in stronds afar remote.
==5==No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
==6==Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood,
==7==No more shall trenching war channel her fields,
==8==Nor bruise her flow’rets with the armed hoofs
==9==Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes,
==10==Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
==11==All of one nature, of one substance bred,
==12==Did lately meet in the intestine shock
==13==And furious close of civil butchery,
==14==Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
==15==March all one way and be no more oppos’d
==16==Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.
==17==The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
==18==No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
==19==As far as to the sepulchre of Christ⁠—
==20==Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
==21==We are impressed and engag’d to fight⁠—
==22==Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,
==23==Whose arms were moulded in their mother’s womb,
==24==To chase these pagans in those holy fields,
==25==Over whose acres walk’d those blessed feet
==26==Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail’d
==27==For our advantage on the bitter cross.
==28==But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
==29==And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go;
==30==Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
==31==Of you, my gentle cousin Westmorland,
==32==What yesternight our Council did decree
==33==In forwarding this dear expedience.

**WEST.**
==34==My liege, this haste was hot in question.
==35==And many limits of the charge set down
==36==But yesternight, when all athwart there came
==37==A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,
==38==Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,
==39==Leading the men of Herfordshire to fight
==40==Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
==41==Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
==42==A thousand of his people butchered,
==43==Upon whose dead corpse’ there was such misuse,
==44==Such beastly shameless transformation,
==45==By those Welshwomen done as may not be
==46==Without much shame retold or spoken of.

**KING.**
==47==It seems then that the tidings of this broil
==48==Brake off our business for the Holy Land.

**WEST.**
==49==This match’d with other did, my gracious lord,
==50==For more uneven and unwelcome news
==51==Came from the north, and thus it did import:
==52==On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
==53==Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,
==54==That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
==55==At Holmedon met,
==56==Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
==57==As by discharge of their artillery
==58==And shape of likelihood the news was told;
==59==For he that brought them, in the very heat
==60==And pride of their contention did take horse,
==61==Uncertain of the issue any way.

**KING.**
==62==Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
==63==Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,
==64==Stain’d with the variation of each soil
==65==Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
==66==And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
==67==The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
==68==Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
==69==Balk’d in their own blood, did Sir Walter see
==70==On Holmedon’s plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
==71==Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son
==72==To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,
==73==Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.
==74==And is not this an honorable spoil?
==75==A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?

**WEST.**
==76==In faith,
==77==It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

**KING.**
==78==Yea, there thou mak’st me sad, and mak’st me sin
==79==In envy that my Lord Northumberland
==80==Should be the father to so blest a son⁠—
==81==A son who is the theme of honor’s tongue,
==82==Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,
==83==Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride,
==84==Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
==85==See riot and dishonor stain the brow
==86==Of my young Harry. O that it could be prov’d
==87==That some night-tripping fairy had exchang’d
==88==In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
==89==And call’d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
==90==Then would I have his Harry and he mine.
==91==But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
==92==Of this young Percy’s pride? The prisoners
==93==Which he in this adventure hath surpris’d
==94==To his own use he keeps, and sends me word
==95==I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

**WEST.**
==96==This is his uncle’s teaching; this is Worcester,
==97==Malevolent to you in all aspects,
==98==Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
==99==The crest of youth against your dignity.

**KING.**
==100==But I have sent for him to answer this;
==101==And for this cause a while we must neglect
==102==Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
==103==Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we
==104==Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords.
==105==But come yourself with speed to us again,
==106==For more is to be said and to be done
==107==Than out of anger can be uttered.

**WEST.**
==108==I will, my liege.

*Exeunt.*
