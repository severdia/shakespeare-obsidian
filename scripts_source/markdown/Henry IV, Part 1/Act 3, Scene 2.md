## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lords, and others.*

**KING.**
==1== Lords, give us leave, the Prince of Wales and I
==2== Must have some private conference, but be near at hand,
==3== For we shall presently have need of you.
*(Exeunt Lords.)*
==4== I know not whether God will have it so
==5== For some displeasing service I have done,
==6== That in his secret doom, out of my blood
==7== He’ll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
==8== But thou dost in thy passages of life
==9== Make me believe that thou art only mark’d
==10== For the hot vengeance, and the rod of heaven,
==11== To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
==12== Could such inordinate and low desires,
==13== Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
==14== Such barren pleasures, rude society,
==15== As thou art match’d withal and grafted to,
==16== Accompany the greatness of thy blood,
==17== And hold their level with thy princely heart?

**PRINCE.**
==18== So please your Majesty, I would I could
==19== Quit all offenses with as clear excuse
==20== As well as I am doubtless I can purge
==21== Myself of many I am charg’d withal;
==22== Yet such extenuation let me beg
==23== As in reproof of many tales devis’d,
==24== Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
==25== By smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers,
==26== I may for some things true, wherein my youth
==27== Hath faulty wand’red and irregular,
==28== Find pardon on my true submission.

**KING.**
==29== God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,
==30== At thy affections, which do hold a wing
==31== Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
==32== Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,
==33== Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
==34== And art almost an alien to the hearts
==35== Of all the court and princes of my blood;
==36== The hope and expectation of thy time
==37== Is ruin’d, and the soul of every man
==38== Prophetically do forethink thy fall.
==39== Had I so lavish of my presence been,
==40== So common-hackney’d in the eyes of men,
==41== So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
==42== Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
==43== Had still kept loyal to possession,
==44== And left me in reputeless banishment,
==45== A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
==46== By being seldom seen, I could not stir
==47== But like a comet I was wond’red at,
==48== That men would tell their children, “This is he”;
==49== Others would say, “Where, which is Bullingbrook?”
==50== And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
==51== And dress’d myself in such humility
==52== That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts,
==53== Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
==54== Even in the presence of the crowned King.
==55== Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,
==56== My presence, like a robe pontifical,
==57== Ne’er seen but wond’red at, and so my state,
==58== Seldom but sumptuous, show’d like a feast,
==59== And wan by rareness such solemnity.
==60== The skipping King, he ambled up and down,
==61== With shallow jesters, and rash bavin wits,
==62== Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,
==63== Mingled his royalty with cap’ring fools,
==64== Had his great name profaned with their scorns,
==65== And gave his countenance, against his name,
==66== To laugh at gibing boys, and stand the push
==67== Of every beardless vain comparative,
==68== Grew a companion to the common streets,
==69== Enfeoff’d himself to popularity,
==70== That, being daily swallowed by men’s eyes,
==71== They surfeited with honey and began
==72== To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
==73== More than a little is by much too much.
==74== So when he had occasion to be seen,
==75== He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
==76== Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
==77== As, sick and blunted with community,
==78== Afford no extraordinary gaze,
==79== Such as is bent on sunlike majesty
==80== When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
==81== But rather drows’d and hung their eyelids down,
==82== Slept in his face and rend’red such aspect
==83== As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
==84== Being with his presence glutted, gorg’d, and full.
==85== And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,
==86== For thou hast lost thy princely privilege
==87== With vile participation. Not an eye
==88== But is a-weary of thy common sight,
==89== Save mine, which hath desir’d to see thee more,
==90== Which now doth that I would not have it do,
==91== Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

**PRINCE.**
==92== I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,
==93== Be more myself.

**KING.**
==94== For all the world
==95== As thou art to this hour was Richard then
==96== When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
==97== And even as I was then is Percy now.
==98== Now by my scepter, and my soul to boot,
==99== He hath more worthy interest to the state
==100== Than thou the shadow of succession.
==101== For of no right, nor color like to right,
==102== He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
==103== Turns head against the lion’s armed jaws,
==104== And being no more in debt to years than thou,
==105== Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
==106== To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
==107== What never-dying honor hath he got
==108== Against renowned Douglas! Whose high deeds,
==109== Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,
==110== Holds from all soldiers chief majority
==111== And military title capital
==112== Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.
==113== Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
==114== This infant warrior, in his enterprises
==115== Discomfited great Douglas, ta’en him once,
==116== Enlarg’d him and made a friend of him,
==117== To fill the mouth of deep defiance up,
==118== And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
==119== And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
==120== The Archbishop’s grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
==121== Capitulate against us, and are up.
==122== But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
==123== Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
==124== Which art my nearest and dearest enemy?
==125== Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
==126== Base inclination, and the start of spleen,
==127== To fight against me under Percy’s pay,
==128== To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
==129== To show how much thou art degenerate.

**PRINCE.**
==130== Do not think so, you shall not find it so,
==131== And God forgive them that so much have sway’d
==132== Your Majesty’s good thoughts away from me!
==133== I will redeem all this on Percy’s head,
==134== And in the closing of some glorious day
==135== Be bold to tell you that I am your son,
==136== When I will wear a garment all of blood,
==137== And stain my favors in a bloody mask,
==138== Which wash’d away shall scour my shame with it.
==139== And that shall be the day, when e’er it lights,
==140== That this same child of honor and renown,
==141== This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
==142== And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
==143== For every honor sitting on his helm,
==144== Would they were multitudes, and on my head
==145== My shames redoubled! For the time will come
==146== That I shall make this northern youth exchange
==147== His glorious deeds for my indignities.
==148== Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
==149== To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
==150== And I will call him to so strict account
==151== That he shall render every glory up,
==152== Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
==153== Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
==154== This in the name of God I promise here,
==155== The which if he be pleas’d I shall perform,
==156== I do beseech your Majesty may salve
==157== The long-grown wounds of my intemperance.
==158== If not, the end of life cancels all bands,
==159== And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
==160== Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

**KING.**
==161== A hundred thousand rebels die in this.
==162== Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
*(Enter Blunt.)*
==163== How now, good Blunt? Thy looks are full of speed.

**BLUNT.**
==164== So hath the business that I come to speak of.
==165== Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
==166== That Douglas and the English rebels met
==167== The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury.
==168== A mighty and a fearful head they are,
==169== If promises be kept on every hand,
==170== As ever off’red foul play in a state.

**KING.**
==171== The Earl of Westmorland set forth today,
==172== With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster,
==173== For this advertisement is five days old.
==174== On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward,
==175== On Thursday we ourselves will march. Our meeting
==176== Is Bridgenorth. And, Harry, you shall march
==177== Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
==178== Our business valued, some twelve days hence
==179== Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
==180== Our hands are full of business, let’s away,
==181== Advantage feeds him fat while men delay.

*Exeunt.*
