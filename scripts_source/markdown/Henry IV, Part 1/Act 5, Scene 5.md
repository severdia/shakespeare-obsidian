## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]]

*Another part of the field.*

*The trumpets sound. Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmorland, with Worcester and Vernon as prisoners.*

**KING.**
==1== Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
==2== Ill-spirited Worcester, did not we send grace,
==3== Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?
==4== And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
==5== Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman’s trust?
==6== Three knights upon our party slain today,
==7== A noble earl, and many a creature else
==8== Had been alive this hour,
==9== If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
==10== Betwixt our armies true intelligence.

**WOR.**
==11== What I have done my safety urg’d me to;
==12== And I embrace this fortune patiently,
==13== Since not to be avoided it falls on me.

**KING.**
==14== Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too.
==15== Other offenders we will pause upon.
*(Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, guarded.)*
==16== How goes the field?

**PRINCE.**
==17== The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
==18== The fortune of the day quite turn’d from him,
==19== The noble Percy slain, and all his men
==20== Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest,
==21== And falling from a hill, he was so bruis’d
==22== That the pursuers took him. At my tent
==23== The Douglas is; and I beseech your Grace
==24== I may dispose of him.

**KING.**
==24==            With all my heart.

**PRINCE.**
==25== Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
==26== This honorable bounty shall belong.
==27== Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
==28== Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free.
==29== His valors shown upon our crests today
==30== Have taught us how to cherish such high deeds
==31== Even in the bosom of our adversaries.

**LAN.**
==32== I thank your Grace for this high courtesy,
==33== Which I shall give away immediately.

**KING.**
==34== Then this remains, that we divide our power.
==35== You, son John, and my cousin Westmorland
==36== Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
==37== To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
==38== Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.
==39== Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
==40== To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
==41== Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
==42== Meeting the check of such another day,
==43== And since this business so fair is done,
==44== Let us not leave till all our own be won.

*Exeunt.*
