## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]]

*Another part of the field.*

*The trumpets sound. Enter the King, Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster, Earl of Westmorland, with Worcester and Vernon as prisoners.*

**KING.**
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
Ill-spirited Worcester, did not we send grace,
Pardon, and terms of love to all of you?
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman’s trust?
Three knights upon our party slain today,
A noble earl, and many a creature else
Had been alive this hour,
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.

**WOR.**
What I have done my safety urg’d me to;
And I embrace this fortune patiently,
Since not to be avoided it falls on me.

**KING.**
Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too.
Other offenders we will pause upon.
*(Exeunt Worcester and Vernon, guarded.)*
How goes the field?

**PRINCE.**
The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
The fortune of the day quite turn’d from him,
The noble Percy slain, and all his men
Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest,
And falling from a hill, he was so bruis’d
That the pursuers took him. At my tent
The Douglas is; and I beseech your Grace
I may dispose of him.

**KING.**
           With all my heart.

**PRINCE.**
Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
This honorable bounty shall belong.
Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free.
His valors shown upon our crests today
Have taught us how to cherish such high deeds
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.

**LAN.**
I thank your Grace for this high courtesy,
Which I shall give away immediately.

**KING.**
Then this remains, that we divide our power.
You, son John, and my cousin Westmorland
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
Who, as we hear, are busily in arms.
Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
Meeting the check of such another day,
And since this business so fair is done,
Let us not leave till all our own be won.

*Exeunt.*
