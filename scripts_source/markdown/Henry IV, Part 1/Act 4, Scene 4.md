## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*York. The Archbishop’s palace.*

*Enter Archbishop of York, Sir Michael.*

**ARCH.**
==1==Hie, good Sir Michael, bear this sealed brief
==2==With winged haste to the Lord Marshal,
==3==This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
==4==To whom they are directed. If you knew
==5==How much they do import, you would make haste.

**SIR M.**
==6==My good lord,
==7==I guess their tenor.

**ARCH.**
==7==           Like enough you do.
==8==Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
==9==Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
==10==Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
==11==As I am truly given to understand,
==12==The King with mighty and quick-raised power
==13==Meets with Lord Harry; and I fear, Sir Michael,
==14==What with the sickness of Northumberland,
==15==Whose power was in the first proportion,
==16==And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence,
==17==Who with them was a rated sinew too,
==18==And comes not in, overrul’d by prophecies,
==19==I fear the power of Percy is too weak
==20==To wage an instant trial with the King.

**SIR M.**
==21==Why, my good lord, you need not fear,
==22==There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.

**ARCH.**
==23==No, Mortimer is not there.

**SIR M.**
==24==But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
==25==And there is my Lord of Worcester, and a head
==26==Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.

**ARCH.**
==27==And so there is; but yet the King hath drawn
==28==The special head of all the land together:
==29==The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
==30==The noble Westmorland, and warlike Blunt,
==31==And many more corrivals and dear men
==32==Of estimation and command in arms.

**SIR M.**
==33==Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well oppos’d.

**ARCH.**
==34==I hope no less, yet needful ’tis to fear,
==35==And to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed;
==36==For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the King
==37==Dismiss his power he means to visit us,
==38==For he hath heard of our confederacy,
==39==And ’tis but wisdom to make strong against him.
==40==Therefore make haste. I must go write again
==41==To other friends, and so farewell, Sir Michael.

*Exeunt.*
