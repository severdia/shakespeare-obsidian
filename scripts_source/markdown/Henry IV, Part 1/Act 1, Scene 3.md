## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Enter the King, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter Blunt, with others.*

**KING.**
==1==My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
==2==Unapt to stir at these indignities,
==3==And you have found me, for accordingly
==4==You tread upon my patience; but be sure
==5==I will from henceforth rather be myself,
==6==Mighty and to be fear’d, than my condition,
==7==Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
==8==And therefore lost that title of respect
==9==Which the proud soul ne’er pays but to the proud.

**WOR.**
==10==Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
==11==The scourge of greatness to be us’d on it,
==12==And that same greatness too which our own hands
==13==Have help to make so portly.

**NORTH.**
==14==My lord⁠—

**KING.**
==15==Worcester, get thee gone, for I do see
==16==Danger and disobedience in thine eye.
==17==O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
==18==And majesty might never yet endure
==19==The moody frontier of a servant brow.
==20==You have good leave to leave us. When we need
==21==Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
*(Exit Worcester.)*
==22==You were about to speak.

**NORTH.**
==22==              Yea, my good lord.
==23==Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded,
==24==Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
==25==Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
==26==As is delivered to your Majesty.
==27==Either envy, therefore, or misprision
==28==Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.

**HOT.**
==29==My liege, I did deny no prisoners,
==30==But I remember, when the fight was done,
==31==When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
==32==Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
==33==Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress’d,
==34==Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap’d
==35==Show’d like a stubble-land at harvest-home.
==36==He was perfumed like a milliner,
==37==And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held
==38==A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
==39==He gave his nose and took’t away again,
==40==Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
==41==Took it in snuff—and still he smil’d and talk’d:
==42==And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
==43==He call’d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
==44==To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
==45==Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
==46==With many holiday and lady terms
==47==He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded
==48==My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf.
==49==I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
==50==To be so pest’red with a popingay,
==51==Out of my grief and my impatience
==52==Answer’d neglectingly, I know not what⁠—
==53==He should, or he should not—for he made me mad
==54==To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet,
==55==And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
==56==Of guns, and drums, and wounds, God save the mark!
==57==And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth
==58==Was parmaciti for an inward bruise,
==59==And that it was great pity, so it was,
==60==This villainous saltpeter should be digg’d
==61==Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
==62==Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed
==63==So cowardly, and but for these vile guns
==64==He would himself have been a soldier.
==65==This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
==66==I answered indirectly, as I said,
==67==And I beseech you, let not his report
==68==Come current for an accusation
==69==Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.

**BLUNT.**
==70==The circumstance considered, good my lord,
==71==What e’er Lord Harry Percy then had said
==72==To such a person, and in such a place,
==73==At such a time, with all the rest retold,
==74==May reasonably die, and never rise
==75==To do him wrong, or any way impeach
==76==What then he said, so he unsay it now.

**KING.**
==77==Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
==78==But with proviso and exception,
==79==That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
==80==His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,
==81==Who, on my soul, hath willfully betray’d
==82==The lives of those that he did lead to fight
==83==Against that great magician, damn’d Glendower,
==84==Whose daughter, as we hear, that Earl of March
==85==Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then
==86==Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
==87==Shall we buy treason? And indent with fears,
==88==When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
==89==No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
==90==For I shall never hold that man my friend
==91==Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
==92==To ransom home revolted Mortimer.

**HOT.**
==93==Revolted Mortimer!
==94==He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
==95==But by the chance of war; to prove that true
==96==Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
==97==Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,
==98==When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank,
==99==In single opposition hand to hand,
==100==He did confound the best part of an hour
==101==In changing hardiment with great Glendower.
==102==Three times they breath’d and three times did they drink,
==103==Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood,
==104==Who then affrighted with their bloody looks,
==105==Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
==106==And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
==107==Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.
==108==Never did base and rotten policy
==109==Color her working with such deadly wounds,
==110==Nor never could the noble Mortimer
==111==Receive so many, and all willingly.
==112==Then let not him be slandered with revolt.

**KING.**
==113==Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
==114==He never did encounter with Glendower.
==115==I tell thee,
==116==He durst as well have met the devil alone
==117==As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
==118==Art thou not asham’d? But, sirrah, henceforth
==119==Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.
==120==Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
==121==Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
==122==As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland:
==123==We license your departure with your son.
==124==Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.

*Exit King with Blunt and Train.*

**HOT.**
==125==And if the devil come and roar for them,
==126==I will not send them. I will after straight
==127==And tell him so, for I will ease my heart,
==128==Albeit I make a hazard of my head.

**NORTH.**
==129==What? Drunk with choler? Stay, and pause a while.
==130==Here comes your uncle.

*Enter Worcester.*

**HOT.**
==130==              Speak of Mortimer!
==131==’Zounds, I will speak of him, and let my soul
==132==Want mercy if I do not join with him.
==133==Yea, on his part I’ll empty all these veins,
==134==And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
==135==But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
==136==As high in the air as this unthankful king,
==137==As this ingrate and cank’red Bullingbrook.

**NORTH.**
==138==Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.

**WOR.**
==139==Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

**HOT.**
==140==He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners,
==141==And when I urg’d the ransom once again
==142==Of my wive’s brother, then his cheek look’d pale,
==143==And on my face he turn’d an eye of death,
==144==Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.

**WOR.**
==145==I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim’d
==146==By Richard, that dead is, the next of blood?

**NORTH.**
==147==He was, I heard the proclamation.
==148==And then it was when the unhappy king
==149==(Whose wrongs in us God pardon!) did set forth
==150==Upon his Irish expedition;
==151==From whence he intercepted did return
==152==To be depos’d, and shortly murdered.

**WOR.**
==153==And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth
==154==Live scandaliz’d and foully spoken of.

**HOT.**
==155==But soft, I pray you, did King Richard then
==156==Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
==157==Heir to the crown?

**NORTH.**
==157==           He did, myself did hear it.

**HOT.**
==158==Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
==159==That wish’d him on the barren mountains starve.
==160==But shall it be that you, that set the crown
==161==Upon the head of this forgetful man,
==162==And for his sake wear the detested blot
==163==Of murderous subornation—shall it be
==164==That you a world of curses undergo,
==165==Being the agents or base second means,
==166==The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
==167==O, pardon me that I descend so low
==168==To show the line and the predicament
==169==Wherein you range under this subtle king!
==170==Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
==171==Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
==172==That men of your nobility and power
==173==Did gage them both in an unjust behalf
==174==(As both of you—God pardon it!—have done) 
==175==To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
==176==And plant this thorn, this canker, Bullingbrook?
==177==And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
==178==That you are fool’d, discarded, and shook off
==179==By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
==180==No, yet time serves wherein you may redeem
==181==Your banish’d honors and restore yourselves
==182==Into the good thoughts of the world again;
==183==Revenge the jeering and disdain’d contempt
==184==Of this proud king, who studies day and night
==185==To answer all the debt he owes to you
==186==Even with the bloody payment of your deaths.
==187==Therefore I say⁠—

**WOR.**
==187==        Peace, cousin, say no more.
==188==And now I will unclasp a secret book,
==189==And to your quick-conceiving discontents
==190==I’ll read you matter deep and dangerous,
==191==As full of peril and adventurous spirit
==192==As to o’erwalk a current roaring loud
==193==On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.

**HOT.**
==194==If he fall in, good night, or sink or swim.
==195==Send danger from the east unto the west,
==196==So honor cross it from the north to south,
==197==And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs
==198==To rouse a lion than to start a hare!

**NORTH.**
==199==Imagination of some great exploit
==200==Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.

**HOT.**
==201==By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
==202==To pluck bright honor from the pale-fac’d moon,
==203==Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
==204==Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
==205==And pluck up drowned honor by the locks,
==206==So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
==207==Without corrival all her dignities;
==208==But out upon this half-fac’d fellowship!

**WOR.**
==209==He apprehends a world of figures here,
==210==But not the form of what he should attend.
==211==Good cousin, give me audience for a while.

**HOT.**
==212==I cry you mercy.

**WOR.**
==212==        Those same noble Scots
==213==That are your prisoners⁠—

**HOT.**
==213==              I’ll keep them all!
==214==By God, he shall not have a Scot of them,
==215==No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not!
==216==I’ll keep them, by this hand.

**WOR.**
==216==              You start away,
==217==And lend no ear unto my purposes.
==218==Those prisoners you shall keep.

**HOT.**
==218==                Nay, I will; that’s flat.
==219==He said he would not ransom Mortimer,
==220==Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer,
==221==But I will find him when he lies asleep,
==222==And in his ear I’ll holla “Mortimer!”
==223==Nay,
==224==I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak
==225==Nothing but “Mortimer,” and give it him
==226==To keep his anger still in motion.

**WOR.**
==227==Hear you, cousin, a word.

**HOT.**
==228==All studies here I solemnly defy,
==229==Save how to gall and pinch this Bullingbrook,
==230==And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
==231==But that I think his father loves him not
==232==And would be glad he met with some mischance,
==233==I would have him poisoned with a pot of ale.

**WOR.**
==234==Farewell, kinsman! I’ll talk to you
==235==When you are better temper’d to attend.

**NORTH.**
==236==Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
==237==Art thou to break into this woman’s mood,
==238==Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!

**HOT.**
==239==Why, look you, I am whipt and scourg’d with rods,
==240==Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
==241==Of this vile politician, Bullingbrook.
==242==In Richard’s time—what do you call the place?⁠—
==243==A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire⁠—
==244==’Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept⁠—
==245==His uncle York—where I first bow’d my knee
==246==Unto this king of smiles, this Bullingbrook⁠—
==247==’Sblood!
==248==When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh⁠—

**NORTH.**
==249==At Berkeley castle.

**HOT.**
==250==You say true.
==251==Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
==252==This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
==253==“Look when his infant fortune came to age”
==254==And “gentle Harry Percy” and “kind cousin”⁠—
==255==O, the devil take such cozeners!—God forgive me!
==256==Good uncle, tell your tale—I have done.

**WOR.**
==257==Nay, if you have not, to it again,
==258==We will stay your leisure.

**HOT.**
==258==              I have done, i’faith.

**WOR.**
==259==Then once more to your Scottish prisoners:
==260==Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
==261==And make the Douglas’ son your only mean
==262==For powers in Scotland, which, for diverse reasons
==263==Which I shall send you written, be assur’d
==264==Will easily be granted.
*(To Northumberland.)*
==264==              You, my lord,
==265==Your son in Scotland being thus employed,
==266==Shall secretly into the bosom creep
==267==Of that same noble prelate well belov’d,
==268==The Archbishop.

**HOT.**
==269==Of York, is it not?

**WOR.**
==270==True, who bears hard
==271==His brother’s death at Bristow, the Lord Scroop.
==272==I speak not this in estimation,
==273==As what I think might be, but what I know
==274==Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,
==275==And only stays but to behold the face
==276==Of that occasion that shall bring it on.

**HOT.**
==277==I smell it. Upon my life, it will do well.

**NORTH.**
==278==Before the game is afoot thou still let’st slip.

**HOT.**
==279==Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.
==280==And then the power of Scotland, and of York,
==281==To join with Mortimer, ha?

**WOR.**
==281==              And so they shall.

**HOT.**
==282==In faith, it is exceedingly well aim’d.

**WOR.**
==283==And ’tis no little reason bids us speed,
==284==To save our heads by raising of a head,
==285==For bear ourselves as even as we can,
==286==The King will always think him in our debt,
==287==And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
==288==Till he hath found a time to pay us home.
==289==And see already how he doth begin
==290==To make us strangers to his looks of love.

**HOT.**
==291==He does, he does, we’ll be reveng’d on him.

**WOR.**
==292==Cousin, farewell! No further go in this
==293==Than I by letters shall direct your course.
==294==When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
==295==I’ll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,
==296==Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
==297==As I will fashion it, shall happily meet
==298==To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
==299==Which now we hold at much uncertainty.

**NORTH.**
==300==Farewell, good brother, we shall thrive, I trust.

**HOT.**
==301==Uncle, *adieu*! O, let the hours be short,
==302==Till fields, and blows, and groans applaud our sport!

*Exeunt.*
