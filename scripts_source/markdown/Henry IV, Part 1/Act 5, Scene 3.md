## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The plain between the camps.*

*The trumpets sound. The King enters with his power and passes over.*

*Alarm to the battle. Then enter Douglas and Sir Walter Blunt.*

**BLUNT.**
==1== What is thy name, that in battle thus
==2== Thou crossest me? What honor dost thou seek
==3== Upon my head?

**DOUG.**
==3==         Know then, my name is Douglas,
==4== And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
==5== Because some tell me that thou art a king.

**BLUNT.**
==6== They tell thee true.

**DOUG.**
==7== The Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought
==8== Thy likeness, for in stead of thee, King Harry,
==9== This sword hath ended him. So shall it thee,
==10== Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.

**BLUNT.**
==11== I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,
==12== And thou shalt find a king that will revenge
==13== Lord Stafford’s death.

*They fight.*

*Douglas kills Blunt.*

*Then enter Hotspur.*

**HOT.**
==14== O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
==15== I never had triumph’d upon a Scot.

**DOUG.**
==16== All’s done, all’s won, here breathless lies the King.

**HOT.**
==17== Where?

**DOUG.**
==18== Here.

**HOT.**
==19== This, Douglas? No, I know this face full well.
==20== A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt,
==21== Semblably furnish’d like the King himself.

**DOUG.**
==22== A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
==23== A borrowed title hast thou bought too dear.
==24== Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?

**HOT.**
==25== The King hath many marching in his coats.

**DOUG.**
==26== Now by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
==27== I’ll murder all his wardrop, piece by piece,
==28== Until I meet the King.

**HOT.**
==28==               Up and away!
==29== Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day.

*Exeunt.*

*Alarm. Enter Falstaff solus.*

**FAL.**
==30== Though I could scape shot-free at London, I fear the shot here, here’s no scoring but upon the pate. Soft, who are you? Sir Walter Blunt. There’s honor for you! Here’s no vanity! I am as hot as molten lead, and as heavy too. God keep lead out of me! I need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have led my ragamuffins where they are pepper’d; there’s not three of my hundred and fifty left alive, and they are for the town’s end, to beg during life. But who comes here?

*Enter the Prince.*

**PRINCE.**
==31== What, stands thou idle here? Lend me thy sword.
==32== Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff
==33== Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
==34== Whose deaths are yet unreveng’d. I prithee lend me thy sword.

**FAL.**
==35== O Hal, I prithee give me leave to breathe a while. Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.

**PRINCE.**
==36== He is indeed, and living to kill thee. I prithee lend me thy sword.

**FAL.**
==37== Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou gets not my sword, but take my pistol, if thou wilt.

**PRINCE.**
==38== Give it me. What? Is it in the case?

**FAL.**
==39== Ay, Hal, ’tis hot, ’tis hot. There’s that will sack a city.

*The Prince draws it out, and finds it to be a bottle of sack.*

**PRINCE.**
==40== What, is it a time to jest and dally now?

*He throws the bottle at him.*

*Exit.*

**FAL.**
==41== Well, if Percy be alive, I’ll pierce him. If he do come in my way, so; if he do not, if I come in his willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like not such grinning honor as Sir Walter hath. Give me life, which if I can save, so; if not, honor comes unlook’d for, and there’s an end.

*Exit.*
