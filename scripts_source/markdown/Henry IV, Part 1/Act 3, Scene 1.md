## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Wales. Glendower’s castle.*

*Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Lord Mortimer, Owen Glendower.*

**MORT.**
==1==These promises are fair, the parties sure,
==2==And our induction full of prosperous hope.

**HOT.**
==3==Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
==4==Will you sit down?
==5==And uncle Worcester—a plague upon it!
==6==I have forgot the map.

**GLEND.**
==6==              No, here it is.
==7==Sit, cousin Percy, sit, good cousin Hotspur,
==8==For by that name as oft as Lancaster
==9==Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale, and with
==10==A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.

**HOT.**
==11==And you in hell, as oft as he hears
==12==Owen Glendower spoke of.

**GLEND.**
==13==I cannot blame him. At my nativity
==14==The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes
==15==Of burning cressets, and at my birth
==16==The frame and huge foundation of the earth
==17==Shak’d like a coward.

**HOT.**
==17==           Why, so it would have done
==18==At the same season if your mother’s cat had
==19==But kitten’d, though yourself had never been born.

**GLEND.**
==20==I say the earth did shake when I was born.

**HOT.**
==21==And I say the earth was not of my mind,
==22==If you suppose as fearing you it shook.

**GLEND.**
==23==The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.

**HOT.**
==24==O then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
==25==And not in fear of your nativity.
==26==Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
==27==In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
==28==Is with a kind of colic pinch’d and vex’d
==29==By the imprisoning of unruly wind
==30==Within her womb, which, for enlargement striving,
==31==Shakes the old beldame earth, and topples down
==32==Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
==33==Our grandam earth, having this distemp’rature,
==34==In passion shook.

**GLEND.**
==34==           Cousin, of many men
==35==I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
==36==To tell you once again that at my birth
==37==The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
==38==The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
==39==Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
==40==These signs have mark’d me extraordinary,
==41==And all the courses of my life do show
==42==I am not in the roll of common men.
==43==Where is he living, clipt in with the sea
==44==That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
==45==Which calls me pupil or hath read to me?
==46==And bring him out that is but woman’s son
==47==Can trace me in the tedious ways of art,
==48==And hold me pace in deep experiments.

**HOT.**
==49==I think there’s no man speaks better Welsh.
==50==I’ll to dinner.

**MORT.**
==51==Peace, cousin Percy, you will make him mad.

**GLEND.**
==52==I can call spirits from the vasty deep.

**HOT.**
==53==Why, so can I, or so can any man,
==54==But will they come when you do call for them?

**GLEND.**
==55==Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
==56==The devil.

**HOT.**
==57==And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
==58==By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
==59==If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
==60==And I’ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
==61==O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!

**MORT.**
==62==Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.

**GLEND.**
==63==Three times hath Henry Bullingbrook made head
==64==Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
==65==And sandy-bottom’d Severn have I sent him
==66==Bootless home and weather-beaten back.

**HOT.**
==67==Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
==68==How scapes he agues, in the devil’s name?

**GLEND.**
==69==Come, here is the map. Shall we divide our right
==70==According to our threefold order ta’en?

**MORT.**
==71==The Archdeacon hath divided it
==72==Into three limits very equally:
==73==England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
==74==By south and east is to my part assign’d;
==75==All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
==76==And all the fertile land within that bound,
==77==To Owen Glendower; and, dear coz, to you
==78==The remnant northward lying off from Trent.
==79==And our indentures tripartite are drawn,
==80==Which being sealed interchangeably
==81==(A business that this night may execute),
==82==Tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I
==83==And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
==84==To meet your father and the Scottish power,
==85==As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
==86==My father Glendower is not ready yet,
==87==Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.
==88==Within that space you may have drawn together
==89==Your tenants, friends, and neighboring gentlemen.

**GLEND.**
==90==A shorter time shall send me to you, lords,
==91==And in my conduct shall your ladies come,
==92==From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
==93==For there will be a world of water shed
==94==Upon the parting of your wives and you.

**HOT.**
==95==Methinks my moi’ty, north from Burton here,
==96==In quantity equals not one of yours.
==97==See how this river comes me cranking in,
==98==And cuts me from the best of all my land
==99==A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
==100==I’ll have the current in this place damm’d up,
==101==And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
==102==In a new channel fair and evenly.
==103==It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
==104==To rob me of so rich a bottom here.

**GLEND.**
==105==Not wind? It shall, it must, you see it doth.

**MORT.**
==106==Yea, but
==107==Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
==108==With like advantage on the other side,
==109==Gelding the opposed continent as much
==110==As on the other side it takes from you.

**WOR.**
==111==Yea, but a little charge will trench him here,
==112==And on this north side win this cape of land,
==113==And then he runs straight and even.

**HOT.**
==114==I’ll have it so, a little charge will do it.

**GLEND.**
==115==I’ll not have it alt’red.

**HOT.**
==115==           Will not you?

**GLEND.**
==116==No, nor you shall not.

**HOT.**
==116==           Who shall say me nay?

**GLEND.**
==117==Why, that will I.

**HOT.**
==117==        Let me not understand you then,
==118==Speak it in Welsh.

**GLEND.**
==119==I can speak English, lord, as well as you,
==120==For I was train’d up in the English court,
==121==Where being but young I framed to the harp
==122==Many an English ditty lovely well,
==123==And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
==124==A virtue that was never seen in you.

**HOT.**
==125==Marry,
==126==And I am glad of it with all my heart.
==127==I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
==128==Than one of these same meter ballet-mongers.
==129==I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn’d,
==130==Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree,
==131==And that would set my teeth nothing an edge,
==132==Nothing so much as mincing poetry.
==133==’Tis like the forc’d gait of a shuffling nag.

**GLEND.**
==134==Come, you shall have Trent turn’d.

**HOT.**
==135==I do not care. I’ll give thrice so much land
==136==To any well-deserving friend;
==137==But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
==138==I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
==139==Are the indentures drawn? Shall we be gone?

**GLEND.**
==140==The moon shines fair, you may away by night.
==141==I’ll haste the writer, and withal
==142==Break with your wives of your departure hence.
==143==I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
==144==So much she doteth on her Mortimer.

*Exit.*

**MORT.**
==145==Fie, cousin Percy, how you cross my father!

**HOT.**
==146==I cannot choose. Sometime he angers me
==147==With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,
==148==Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
==149==And of a dragon and a finless fish,
==150==A clip-wing’d griffin and a moulten raven,
==151==A couching lion and a ramping cat,
==152==And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
==153==As puts me from my faith. I tell you what:
==154==He held me last night at least nine hours
==155==In reckoning up the several devils’ names
==156==That were his lackeys. I cried “hum,” and “well, go to,”
==157==But mark’d him not a word. O, he is as tedious
==158==As a tired horse, a railing wife,
==159==Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live
==160==With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
==161==Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
==162==In any summer house in Christendom.

**MORT.**
==163==In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
==164==Exceedingly well read, and profited
==165==In strange concealments, valiant as a lion,
==166==And wondrous affable, and as bountiful
==167==As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
==168==He holds your temper in a high respect,
==169==And curbs himself even of his natural scope
==170==When you come ’cross his humor, faith, he does.
==171==I warrant you, that man is not alive
==172==Might so have tempted him as you have done,
==173==Without the taste of danger and reproof.
==174==But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.

**WOR.**
==175==In faith, my lord, you are too willful-blame,
==176==And since your coming hither have done enough
==177==To put him quite besides his patience.
==178==You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault;
==179==Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood⁠—
==180==And that’s the dearest grace it renders you⁠—
==181==Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
==182==Defect of manners, want of government,
==183==Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain,
==184==The least of which haunting a nobleman
==185==Loseth men’s hearts and leaves behind a stain
==186==Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
==187==Beguiling them of commendation.

**HOT.**
==188==Well, I am school’d: good manners be your speed!
==189==Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.

*Enter Glendower with the Ladies.*

**MORT.**
==190==This is the deadly spite that angers me:
==191==My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.

**GLEND.**
==192==My daughter weeps, she’ll not part with you,
==193==She’ll be a soldier too, she’ll to the wars.

**MORT.**
==194==Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
==195==Shall follow in your conduct speedily.

*Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she answers him in the same.*

**GLEND.**
==196==She is desperate here, a peevish self-will’d harlotry,
==197==One that no persuasion can do good upon.

*The lady speaks in Welsh.*

**MORT.**
==198==I understand thy looks. That pretty Welsh
==199==Which thou pourest down from these swelling heavens
==200==I am too perfect in, and but for shame,
==201==In such a parley should I answer thee.
*(The lady again in Welsh.)*
==202==I understand thy kisses, and thou mine,
==203==And that’s a feeling disputation,
==204==But I will never be a truant, love,
==205==Till I have learn’d thy language, for thy tongue
==206==Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn’d,
==207==Sung by a fair queen in a summer’s bow’r,
==208==With ravishing division, to her lute.

**GLEND.**
==209==Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.

*The lady speaks again in Welsh.*

**MORT.**
==210==O, I am ignorance itself in this!

**GLEND.**
==211==She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down,
==212==And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
==213==And she will sing the song that pleaseth you,
==214==And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,
==215==Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
==216==Making such difference ’twixt wake and sleep
==217==As is the difference betwixt day and night
==218==The hour before the heavenly-harness’d team
==219==Begins his golden progress in the east.

**MORT.**
==220==With all my heart I’ll sit and hear her sing.
==221==By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.

**GLEND.**
==222==Do so,
==223==And those musicians that shall play to you
==224==Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
==225==And straight they shall be here. Sit and attend.

**HOT.**
==226==Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down.
==227==Come, quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.

**LADY P.**
==228==Go, ye giddy goose.

*The music plays.*

**HOT.**
==229==Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh,
==230==And ’tis no marvel he is so humorous.
==231==By’r lady, he is a good musician.

**LADY P.**
==232==Then should you be nothing but musical, for you are altogether govern’d by humors. Lie still, ye thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh.

**HOT.**
==233==I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.

**LADY P.**
==234==Wouldst thou have thy head broken?

**HOT.**
==235==No.

**LADY P.**
==236==Then be still.

**HOT.**
==237==Neither, ’tis a woman’s fault.

**LADY P.**
==238==Now God help thee!

**HOT.**
==239==To the Welsh lady’s bed.

**LADY P.**
==240==What’s that?

**HOT.**
==241==Peace, she sings.

*Here the lady sings a Welsh song.*

**HOT.**
==242==Come, Kate, I’ll have your song too.

**LADY P.**
==243==Not mine, in good sooth.

**HOT.**
==244==Not yours, in good sooth! Heart, you swear like a comfit-maker’s wife: “Not you, in good sooth,” and “as true as I live,” and “as God shall mend me,” and “as sure as day”;
==245==And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths
==246==As if thou never walk’st further than Finsbury.
==247==Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
==248==A good mouth-filling oath, and leave “in sooth,”
==249==And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
==250==To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
==251==Come sing.

**LADY P.**
==252==I will not sing.

**HOT.**
==253==’Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be redbreast teacher. And the indentures be drawn, I’ll away within these two hours, and so come in when ye will.

*Exit.*

**GLEND.**
==254==Come, come, Lord Mortimer, you are as slow
==255==As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
==256==By this our book is drawn, we’ll but seal,
==257==And then to horse immediately.

**MORT.**
==257==                  With all my heart.

*Exeunt.*
