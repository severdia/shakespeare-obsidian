## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.*

*Enter Hotspur, Worcester, and Douglas.*

**HOT.**
==1== Well said, my noble Scot! If speaking truth
==2== In this fine age were not thought flattery,
==3== Such attribution should the Douglas have
==4== As not a soldier of this season’s stamp
==5== Should go so general current through the world.
==6== By God, I cannot flatter, I do defy
==7== The tongues of soothers, but a braver place
==8== In my heart’s love hath no man than yourself.
==9== Nay, task me to my word, approve me, lord.

**DOUG.**
==10== Thou art the king of honor.
==11== No man so potent breathes upon the ground
==12== But I will beard him.

*Enter a Messenger with letters.*

**HOT.**
==12==            Do so, and ’tis well.⁠—
==13== What letters hast thou there?—I can but thank you.

**1. MESS.**
==14== These letters come from your father.

**HOT.**
==15== Letters from him! Why comes he not himself?

**1. MESS.**
==16== He cannot come, my lord, he is grievous sick.

**HOT.**
==17== ’Zounds! How has he the leisure to be sick
==18== In such a justling time? Who leads his power?
==19== Under whose government come they along?

**1. MESS.**
==20== His letters bears his mind, not I, my lord.

**WOR.**
==21== I prithee tell me, doth he keep his bed?

**1. MESS.**
==22== He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,
==23== And at the time of my departure thence
==24== He was much fear’d by his physicians.

**WOR.**
==25== I would the state of time had first been whole
==26== Ere he by sickness had been visited,
==27== His health was never better worth than now.

**HOT.**
==28== Sick now? Droop now? This sickness doth infect
==29== The very life-blood of our enterprise,
==30== ’Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
==31== He writes me here, that inward sickness⁠—
==32== And that his friends by deputation could not
==33== So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
==34== To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
==35== On any soul remov’d, but on his own.
==36== Yet doth he give us bold advertisement
==37== That with our small conjunction we should on,
==38== To see how fortune is dispos’d to us,
==39== For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,
==40== Because the King is certainly possess’d
==41== Of all our purposes. What say you to it?

**WOR.**
==42== Your father’s sickness is a maim to us.

**HOT.**
==43== A perilous gash, a very limb lopp’d off⁠—
==44== And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want
==45== Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good
==46== To set the exact wealth of all our states
==47== All at one cast? To set so rich a main
==48== On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
==49== It were not good, for therein should we read
==50== The very bottom and the soul of hope,
==51== The very list, the very utmost bound
==52== Of all our fortunes.

**DOUG.**
==52==            Faith, and so we should,
==53== Where now remains a sweet reversion,
==54== We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
==55== Is to come in.
==56== A comfort of retirement lives in this.

**HOT.**
==57== A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,
==58== If that the devil and mischance look big
==59== Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.

**WOR.**
==60== But yet I would your father had been here.
==61== The quality and hair of our attempt
==62== Brooks no division. It will be thought
==63== By some that know not why he is away
==64== That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike
==65== Of our proceedings kept the Earl from hence,
==66== And think how such an apprehension
==67== May turn the tide of fearful faction,
==68== And breed a kind of question in our cause.
==69== For well you know we of the off’ring side
==70== Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
==71== And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
==72== The eye of reason may pry in upon us.
==73== This absence of your father’s draws a curtain
==74== That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
==75== Before not dreamt of.

**HOT.**
==75==            You strain too far.
==76== I rather of his absence make this use:
==77== It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
==78== A larger dare to our great enterprise,
==79== Than if the Earl were here, for men must think,
==80== If we without his help can make a head
==81== To push against a kingdom, with his help
==82== We shall o’erturn it topsy-turvy down.
==83== Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.

**DOUG.**
==84== As heart can think. There is not such a word
==85== Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.

*Enter Sir Richard Vernon.*

**HOT.**
==86== My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul!

**VER.**
==87== Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
==88== The Earl of Westmorland, seven thousand strong,
==89== Is marching hitherwards, with him Prince John.

**HOT.**
==90== No harm. What more?

**VER.**
==90==               And further, I have learn’d,
==91== The King himself in person is set forth,
==92== Or hitherwards intended speedily,
==93== With strong and mighty preparation.

**HOT.**
==94== He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
==95== The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
==96== And his comrades, that daff’d the world aside
==97== And bid it pass?

**VER.**
==97==         All furnish’d, all in arms;
==98== All plum’d like estridges, that with the wind
==99== Bated like eagles having lately bath’d,
==100== Glittering in golden coats like images,
==101== As full of spirit as the month of May,
==102== And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
==103== Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
==104== I saw young Harry with his beaver on,
==105== His cushes on his thighs, gallantly arm’d,
==106== Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury,
==107== And vaulted with such ease into his seat
==108== As if an angel dropp’d down from the clouds
==109== To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus,
==110== And witch the world with noble horsemanship.

**HOT.**
==111== No more, no more! Worse than the sun in March,
==112== This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come!
==113== They come like sacrifices in their trim,
==114== And to the fire-ey’d maid of smoky war
==115== All hot and bleeding will we offer them.
==116== The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
==117== Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
==118== To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh,
==119== And yet not ours. Come let me taste my horse,
==120== Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
==121== Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.
==122== Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
==123== Meet and ne’er part till one drop down a corse.
==124== O that Glendower were come!

**VER.**
==124==                 There is more news:
==125== I learn’d in Worcester, as I rode along,
==126== He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.

**DOUG.**
==127== That’s the worst tidings that I hear of yet.

**WOR.**
==128== Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.

**HOT.**
==129== What may the King’s whole battle reach unto?

**VER.**
==130== To thirty thousand.

**HOT.**
==130==            Forty let it be!
==131== My father and Glendower being both away,
==132== The powers of us may serve so great a day.
==133== Come let us take a muster speedily.
==134== Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily.

**DOUG.**
==135== Talk not of dying, I am out of fear
==136== Of death or death’s hand for this one half year.

*Exeunt.*
