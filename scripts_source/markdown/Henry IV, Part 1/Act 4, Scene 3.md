## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.*

*Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Douglas, Vernon.*

**HOT.**
==1==We’ll fight with him tonight.

**WOR.**
==1==                It may not be.

**DOUG.**
==2==You give him then advantage.

**VER.**
==2==                Not a whit.

**HOT.**
==3==Why say you so? Looks he not for supply?

**VER.**
==4==So do we.

**HOT.**
==4==        His is certain, ours is doubtful.

**WOR.**
==5==Good cousin, be advis’d, stir not tonight.

**VER.**
==6==Do not, my lord.

**DOUG.**
==6==        You do not counsel well,
==7==You speak it out of fear and cold heart.

**VER.**
==8==Do me no slander, Douglas. By my life,
==9==And I dare well maintain it with my life,
==10==If well-respected honor bid me on,
==11==I hold as little counsel with weak fear
==12==As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives.
==13==Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle
==14==Which of us fears.

**DOUG.**
==14==           Yea, or tonight.

**VER.**
==14==                       Content.

**HOT.**
==15==Tonight, say I.

**VER.**
==16==Come, come, it may not be. I wonder much,
==17==Being men of such great leading as you are,
==18==That you foresee not what impediments
==19==Drag back our expedition. Certain horse
==20==Of my cousin Vernon’s are not yet come up.
==21==Your uncle Worcester’s horses came but today,
==22==And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
==23==Their courage with hard labor tame and dull,
==24==That not a horse is half the half of himself.

**HOT.**
==25==So are the horses of the enemy
==26==In general journey-bated and brought low.
==27==The better part of ours are full of rest.

**WOR.**
==28==The number of the King exceedeth our.
==29==For God’s sake, cousin, stay till all come in.

*The trumpet sounds a parley.*

*Enter Sir Walter Blunt.*

**BLUNT.**
==30==I come with gracious offers from the King,
==31==If you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.

**HOT.**
==32==Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
==33==You were of our determination!
==34==Some of us love you well, and even those some
==35==Envy your great deservings and good name,
==36==Because you are not of our quality,
==37==But stand against us like an enemy.

**BLUNT.**
==38==And God defend but still I should stand so,
==39==So long as out of limit and true rule
==40==You stand against anointed majesty.
==41==But to my charge. The King hath sent to know
==42==The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
==43==You conjure from the breast of civil peace
==44==Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
==45==Audacious cruelty. If that the King
==46==Have any way your good deserts forgot,
==47==Which he confesseth to be manifold,
==48==He bids you name your griefs, and with all speed
==49==You shall have your desires with interest
==50==And pardon absolute for yourself and these
==51==Herein misled by your suggestion.

**HOT.**
==52==The King is kind, and well we know the King
==53==Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
==54==My father and my uncle and myself
==55==Did give him that same royalty he wears,
==56==And when he was not six and twenty strong,
==57==Sick in the world’s regard, wretched and low,
==58==A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
==59==My father gave him welcome to the shore;
==60==And when he heard him swear and vow to God
==61==He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
==62==To sue his livery and beg his peace,
==63==With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
==64==My father, in kind heart and pity mov’d,
==65==Swore him assistance, and perform’d it too.
==66==Now when the lords and barons of the realm
==67==Perceiv’d Northumberland did lean to him,
==68==The more and less came in with cap and knee,
==69==Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
==70==Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
==71==Laid gifts before him, proffer’d him their oaths,
==72==Gave him their heirs as pages, followed him
==73==Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
==74==He presently, as greatness knows itself,
==75==Steps me a little higher than his vow
==76==Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
==77==Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,
==78==And now forsooth takes on him to reform
==79==Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
==80==That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
==81==Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
==82==Over his country’s wrongs, and by this face,
==83==This seeming brow of justice, did he win
==84==The hearts of all that he did angle for;
==85==Proceeded further—cut me off the heads
==86==Of all the favorites that the absent King
==87==In deputation left behind him here,
==88==When he was personal in the Irish war.

**BLUNT.**
==89==Tut, I came not to hear this.

**HOT.**
==89==              Then to the point.
==90==In short time after, he depos’d the King,
==91==Soon after that, depriv’d him of his life,
==92==And in the neck of that, task’d the whole state;
==93==To make that worse, suff’red his kinsman March
==94==(Who is, if every owner were well plac’d,
==95==Indeed his king) to be engag’d in Wales,
==96==There without ransom to lie forfeited;
==97==Disgrac’d me in my happy victories,
==98==Sought to entrap me by intelligence,
==99==Rated mine uncle from the Council-board,
==100==In rage dismiss’d my father from the court,
==101==Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
==102==And in conclusion drove us to seek out
==103==This head of safety, and withal to pry
==104==Into his title, the which we find
==105==Too indirect for long continuance.

**BLUNT.**
==106==Shall I return this answer to the King?

**HOT.**
==107==Not so, Sir Walter; we’ll withdraw a while.
==108==Go to the King, and let there be impawn’d
==109==Some surety for a safe return again,
==110==And in the morning early shall mine uncle
==111==Bring him our purposes. And so farewell.

**BLUNT.**
==112==I would you would accept of grace and love.

**HOT.**
==113==And may be so we shall.

**BLUNT.**
==113==              Pray God you do.

*Exeunt.*
