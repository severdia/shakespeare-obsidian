## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The rebel camp.*

*Enter Worcester, Sir Richard Vernon.*

**WOR.**
==1==O no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
==2==The liberal and kind offer of the King.

**VER.**
==3==’Twere best he did.

**WOR.**
==3==           Then are we all undone;
==4==It is not possible, it cannot be,
==5==The King should keep his word in loving us.
==6==He will suspect us still, and find a time
==7==To punish this offense in other faults.
==8==Supposition all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes,
==9==For treason is but trusted like the fox,
==10==Who never so tame, so cherish’d and lock’d up,
==11==Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
==12==Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
==13==Interpretation will misquote our looks,
==14==And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
==15==The better cherish’d, still the nearer death.
==16==My nephew’s trespass may be well forgot,
==17==It hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
==18==And an adopted name of privilege,
==19==A hare-brain’d Hotspur, govern’d by a spleen.
==20==All his offenses live upon my head
==21==And on his father’s. We did train him on,
==22==And his corruption being ta’en from us,
==23==We as the spring of all shall pay for all.
==24==Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
==25==In any case, the offer of the King.

**VER.**
==26==Deliver what you will, I’ll say ’tis so.
==27==Here comes your cousin.

*Enter Percy Hotspur and Douglas.*

**HOT.**
==27==              My uncle is return’d,
==28==Deliver up my Lord of Westmorland.
==29==Uncle, what news?

**WOR.**
==30==The King will bid you battle presently.

**DOUG.**
==31==Defy him by the Lord of Westmorland.

**HOT.**
==32==Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.

**DOUG.**
==33==Marry, and shall, and very willingly.

*Exit Douglas.*

**WOR.**
==34==There is no seeming mercy in the King.

**HOT.**
==35==Did you beg any? God forbid!

**WOR.**
==36==I told him gently of our grievances,
==37==Of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus,
==38==By now forswearing that he is forsworn.
==39==He calls us rebels, traitors, and will scourge
==40==With haughty arms this hateful name in us.

*Enter Douglas.*

**DOUG.**
==41==Arm, gentlemen, to arms! For I have thrown
==42==A brave defiance in King Henry’s teeth,
==43==And Westmorland, that was engag’d, did bear it,
==44==Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.

**WOR.**
==45==The Prince of Wales stepp’d forth before the King,
==46==And, nephew, challeng’d you to single fight.

**HOT.**
==47==O would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
==48==And that no man might draw short breath today
==49==But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
==50==How show’d his tasking? Seem’d it in contempt?

**VER.**
==51==No, by my soul, I never in my life
==52==Did hear a challenge urg’d more modestly,
==53==Unless a brother should a brother dare
==54==To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
==55==He gave you all the duties of a man,
==56==Trimm’d up your praises with a princely tongue,
==57==Spoke your deservings like a chronicle,
==58==Making you ever better than his praise
==59==By still dispraising praise valued with you,
==60==And which became him like a prince indeed,
==61==He made a blushing cital of himself,
==62==And chid his truant youth with such a grace
==63==As if he mast’red there a double spirit
==64==Of teaching and of learning instantly.
==65==There did he pause, but let me tell the world,
==66==If he outlive the envy of this day,
==67==England did never owe so sweet a hope,
==68==So much misconstrued in his wantonness.

**HOT.**
==69==Cousin, I think thou art enamored
==70==On his follies. Never did I hear
==71==Of any prince so wild a liberty.
==72==But be he as he will, yet once ere night
==73==I will embrace him with a soldier’s arm
==74==That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
==75==Arm, arm with speed! And, fellows, soldiers, friends,
==76==Better consider what you have to do
==77==Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
==78==Can lift your blood up with persuasion.

*Enter Second Messenger.*

**2. MESS.**
==79==My lord, here are letters for you.

**HOT.**
==80==I cannot read them now.
==81==O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
==82==To spend that shortness basely were too long
==83==If life did ride upon a dial’s point,
==84==Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
==85==And if we live, we live to tread on kings,
==86==If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
==87==Now for our consciences, the arms are fair
==88==When the intent of bearing them is just.

*Enter Third Messenger.*

**3. MESS.**
==89==My lord, prepare, the King comes on apace.

**HOT.**
==90==I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,
==91==For I profess not talking; only this⁠—
==92==Let each man do his best, and here draw I
==93==A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
==94==With the best blood that I can meet withal
==95==In the adventure of this perilous day.
==96==Now Esperance! Percy! And set on.
==97==Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
==98==And by that music let us all embrace,
==99==For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall
==100==A second time do such a courtesy.

*Here they embrace and exeunt.*
