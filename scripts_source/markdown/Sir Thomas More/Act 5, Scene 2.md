## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*More’s house.*

*Enter Butler, Porter, Brewer, and Horsekeeper several ways.*

**BUTLER.**
==1== Robin brewer, how now, man! What cheer, what cheer?

**BREWER.**
==2== Faith, Ned Butler, sick of thy disease; and these our other fellows here, Rafe Horsekeeper and Giles Porter, sad, sad; they say my lord goes to his trial today.

**HORSEKEEPER.**
==3== To it, man! Why, he is now at it, God send him well to speed!

**PORTER.**
==4== Amen; even as I wish to mine own soul, so speed it with my honorable lord and master, Sir Thomas More.

**BUTLER.**
==5== I cannot tell, I have nothing to do with matters above my capacity; but, as God judge me, if I might speak my mind, I think there lives not a more harmless gentleman in the universal world.

**BREWER.**
==6== Nor a wiser, nor a merrier, nor an honester; go to, I’ll put that in upon mine own knowledge.

**PORTER.**
==7== Nay, and ye bait him his due of his housekeeping, hang ye all! Ye have many Lord Chancellor’s comes in debt at the year’s end, and for very housekeeping.

**HORSEKEEPER.**
==8== Well, he was too good a lord for us, and therefore, I fear, God himself will take him. But I’ll be hanged, if ever I have such an other service.

**BREWER.**
==9== Soft, man, we are not discharged yet. My lord may come home again, and all will be well.

**BUTLER.**
==10== I much mistrust it; when they go to ‘raigning once, there’s ever foul weather for a great while after. But soft; here comes Master Gough and Master Catesby. Now we shall hear more.

*Enter Gough and Catesby with a paper.*

**HORSEKEEPER.**
==11== Before God, they are very sad; I doubt my lord is condemned.

**PORTER.**
==12== God bless his soul! And a fig then for all wordly condemnation.

**GOUGH.**
==13== Well said, Giles Porter, I commend thee for it;
==14== ’Twas spoken like a well affected servant
==15== Of him that was a kind lord to us all.

**CATESBY.**
==16== Which now no more he shall be; for, dear fellows,
==17== Now we are masterless, though he may live
==18== So long as please the king. But law hath made him
==19== A dead man to the world, and given the axe his head,
==20== But his sweet soul to live among the saints.

**GOUGH.**
==21== Let us entreat ye to go call together
==22== The rest of your sad fellows (by the rule
==23== Y’are just seven score), and tell them what we hear
==24== A virtuous honorable lord hath done
==25== Even for the meanest follower that he had.
==26== This writing found my lady in his study,
==27== This instant morning, wherein is set down
==28== Each servant’s name, according to his place
==29== And office in the house. On every man
==30== He frankly hath bestown twenty nobles,
==31== The best and worst together, all alike,
==32== Which Master Catesby here forth will pay ye.

**CATESBY.**
==33== Take it as it is meant, a kind remembrance
==34== Of a fair kinder lord, with whose sad fall
==35== He gives up house and farewell to us all:
==36== Thus the fair spreading oak falls not alone,
==37== But all the neighbor plants and under-trees
==38== Are crushed down with his weight. No more of this:
==39== Come, and receive your due, and after go
==40== Fellow-like hence, copartners of one woe.

*Exeunt.*
