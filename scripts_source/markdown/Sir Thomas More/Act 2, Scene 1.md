## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Cheapside.*

*Enter three or four Apprentices of trades, with a pair of cudgels.*

**HARRY.**
==1==Come, lay down the cudgels. Ho, Robin, you met us well at Bunhill, to have you with us a Maying this morning.

**ROBIN.**
==2==Faith, Harry, the head drawer at the Miter by the great Conduit called me up, and we went to breakfast into St. Anne’s Lane. But come, who begins? In good faith, I am clean out of practice. When wast at Garret’s school, Harry?

**HARRY.**
==3==Not this great while, never since I brake his usher’s head, when he played his scholar’s prize at the Star in Bread Street. I use all to George Philpot’s at Dowgate; he’s the best backswordman in England.

**KIT.**
==4==“Bate me an ace of that,” quoth Bolton.

**HARRY.**
==5==I’ll not bate ye a pin on’t, sir; for, by this cudgel, ’tis true.

**KIT.**
==6==I will cudgel that opinion out of ye. Did you break an usher’s head, sir?

**HARRY.**
==7==Aye, marry, did I, sir.

**KIT.**
==8==I am very glad on ’t. You shall break mine too, and ye can.

**HARRY.**
==9==Sirrah, I prithee, what art thou?

**KIT.**
==10==Why, I am a prentice as thou art; seest thou now? I’ll play with thee at blunt here in Cheapside, and when thou hast done, if thou beest angry, I’ll fight with thee at sharp in More fields. I have a sword to serve my turn in a favor...come Julie, to serve...

*Exeunt.*
