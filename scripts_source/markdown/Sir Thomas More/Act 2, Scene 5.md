## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Cheapside.*

*Enter First Sheriff, and meet a Messenger.*

**1. SHERIFF.**
==1==Messenger, what news?

**3. MESS.**
==1==              Is execution yet performed?

**1. SHERIFF.**
==2==Not yet; the carts stand ready at the stairs,
==3==And they shall presently away to Tibourne.

**3. MESS.**
==4==Stay, Master Sheriff; it is the council’s pleasure,
==5==For more example in so bad a case,
==6==A gibbet be erected in Cheapside,
==7==Hard by the Standard; whether you must bring
==8==Lincoln and those that were the chief with him,
*(Enter Officers.)*
==9==To suffer death, and that immediately.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==10==It shall be done, sir.
*(Exit Third Messenger.)*
==10==           —Officers, be speedy;
==11==Call for a gibbet, see it be erected;
==12==Others make haste to Newgate, bid them bring
==13==The prisoners hither, for they here must die:
==14==Away, I say, and see no time be slacked.

**OFFICERS.**
==15==We go, sir.

*Exit some severally; others set up the gibbet.*

**1. SHERIFF.**
==16==That’s well said, fellow; now you do your duty.
==17==God for his pity help these troublous times!
==18==The streets stopped up with gazing multitudes:
==19==Command our armed officers with halberds
==20==Make way for entrance of the prisoners;
==21==Let proclamation once again be made.
==22==That every householder, on pain of death,
==23==Keep in his prentices, and every man
==24==Stand with a weapon ready at his door,
==25==As he will answer to the contrary.

**1. OFF.**
==26==I’ll see it done, sir.

*Exit.*

*Enter another Officer.*

**1. SHERIFF.**
==27==Bring them away to execution:
==28==The writ is come above two hours since:
==29==The city will be fined for this neglect.

**2. OFF.**
==30==There’s such a press and multitude at Newgate,
==31==They cannot bring the carts onto the stairs,
==32==To take the prisoners in.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==32==           Then let them come on foot;
==33==We may not dally time with great command.

**2. OFF.**
==34==Some of the bench, sir, think it very fit
==35==That stay be made, and give it out abroad
==36==The execution is deferred till morning,
==37==And, when the streets shall be a little cleared,
==38==To chain them up, and suddenly dispatch it.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==39==Stay; in meantime me thinks they come along:
==40==See, they are coming. So, ’tis very well:
*(The prisoners are brought in, well guarded.)*
==41==Bring Lincoln there the first unto the tree.

**CLOWN.**
==42==I, for I cry lug, sir.

**LINCOLN.**
==43==I knew the first, sir, did belong to me:
==44==This the old proverb now complete doth make,
==45==That ‘Lincoln should be hanged for London’s sake.’
*(He goes up to the gallows.)*
==46==I’God’s name, let us to work. Fellow, dispatch:
==47==I was the foremost man in this rebellion,
==48==And I the foremost that must die for it.

**DOLL.**
==49==Bravely, John Lincoln, let thy death express,
==50==That, as thou liv’dst a man, thou diest no less.

**LINCOLN.**
==51==Doll Williamson, thine eyes shall witness it.
==52==Then to all you that come to view mine end
==53==I must confess, I had no ill intent,
==54==But against such as wronged us over much:
==55==And now I can perceive it was not fit
==56==That private men should carve out their redress,
==57==Which way they list; no, learn it now by me,⁠—
==58==Obedience is the best in each degree:
==59==And asking mercy meekly of my king,
==60==I patiently submit me to the law;
==61==But God forgive them that were cause of it!
==62==And, as a Christian, truly from my heart
==63==I likewise crave they would forgive me too
==64==(As freely as I do forgive their wrong) 
==65==That others by example of the same
==66==Henceforth be warned to attempt the like
==67==’Gainst any alien that repaireth hither.
==68==Fare ye well, all. The next time that we meet,
==69==I trust in heaven we shall each other greet.

*He leaps off.*

**DOLL.**
==70==Farewell, John Lincoln. Say all what they can,
==71==Thou liv’dst a good fellow, and diedst an honest man.

**CLOWN.**
==72==Would I wear so fair on my journey! The first stretch is the worst, methinks.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==73==Bring Williamson there forward.

**DOLL.**
==74==Good Master Sheriff, I have an earnest suit,
==75==And, as you are a man, deny’t me not.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==76==Woman, what is it? Be it in my power,
==77==Thou shalt obtain it.

**DOLL.**
==78==Let me die next, sir; that is all I crave:
==79==You know not what a comfort you shall bring
==80==To my poor heart, to die before my husband.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==81==Bring her to death; she shall have her desire.

**CLOWN.**
==82==Sir, and I have a suit for you too.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==83==What is it?

**CLOWN.**
==84==That, as you have hanged Lincoln first, and will hang her next, so you will not hang me at all.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==85==Nay, you set ope’ the Counter gates, and you must hang for the folly.

**CLOWN.**
==86==Well, then, so much for it!

**DOLL.**
==87==Sir, your free bounty much contents my mind.
==88==Commend me to that good Sheriff Master More,
==89==And tell him, had’t not been for his persuasion,
==90==John Lincoln had not hung here as he does:
==91==We would first have locked us up in Leadenhall,
==92==And there been burnt to ashes with the roof.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==93==Woman, what Master More did was a subject’s duty,
==94==And hath so pleased our gracious lord the king,
==95==That he is hence removed to higher place,
==96==And made of council to his majesty.

**DOLL.**
==97==Well is he worthy of it, by my troth,
==98==An honest, wise, well-spoken gentleman;
==99==Yet would I praise his honesty much more,
==100==If he had kept his word, and saved our lives:
==101==But let that pass; men are but men, and so
==102==Words are but words, and pays not what men owe.
==103==You, husband, since perhaps the world may say
==104==That through my means thou comest thus to thy end,
==105==Here I begin this cup of death to thee,
==106==Because thou shalt be sure to taste no worse
==107==Than I have taken that must go before thee.
==108==What though I be a woman? That’s no matter;
==109==I do owe God a death, and I must pay him.
==110==Husband, give me thy hand; be not dismayed;
==111==This chair being chaired, then all our debt is paid.
==112==Only two little babes we leave behind us,
==113==And all I can bequeath them at this time
==114==Is but the love of some good honest friend,
==115==To bring them up in charitable sort:
==116==What, masters! He goes upright that never halts,
==117==And they may live to mend their parents’ faults.

**WILLIAMSON.**
==118==Why, well said, wife; i’faith, thou cheerest my heart:
==119==Give me thy hand; let’s kiss, and so let’s part.

*He kisses her on the ladder.*

**DOLL.**
==120==The next kiss, Williamson, shall be in heaven.
==121==Now cheerily, lads! George Betts, a hand with thee;
==122==And thine too, Rafe, and thine, good honest Sherwin.
==123==Now let me tell the women of this town,
==124==No stranger yet brought Doll to lying down:
==125==So long as I an Englishman can see,
==126==Nor French nor Dutch shall get a kiss of me;
==127==And when that I am dead, for me yet say,
==128==I died in scorn to be a stranger’s prey.

*A great shout and noise, cry within “Pardon, pardon, pardon, pardon! Room for the Earl of Surrey, room there, room!”*

*Enter Surrey.*

**SURREY.**
==129==Save the man’s life, if it be possible.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==130==It is too late, my lord; he’s dead already.

**SURREY.**
==131==I tell ye, Master Sheriff, you are too forward,
==132==To make such haste with men unto their death;
==133==I think your pains will merit little thanks,
==134==Since that his highness is so merciful
==135==As not to spill the blood of any subject.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==136==My noble lord, would we so much had known!
==137==The Councils’ warrant hastened our dispatch;
==138==It had not else been done so suddenly.

**SURREY.**
==139==Sir Thomas More humbly upon his knee
==140==Did beg the lives of all, since on his word
==141==They did so gently yield. The king hath granted it,
==142==And made him Lord High Chancellor of England.
==143==According as he worthily deserves.
==144==Since Lincoln’s life cannot be had again,
==145==Then for the rest, from my dread sovereign’s lips,
==146==I here pronounce free pardon for them all.

**ALL.**
==147==God save the king, God save the king!
==148==My good Lord Chancellor, and the Earl of Surrey!

*Flinging up caps.*

**DOLL.**
==149==And Doll desires it from her very heart,
==150==More’s name may live for this right noble part;
==151==And whensoere we talk of ill May day,
==152==Praise More, whose honest words our falls did stay.

**SURREY.**
==153==In hope his highness’ clemency and mercy,
==154==Which in the arms of mild and meek compassion
==155==Would rather clip you, as the loving nurse
==156==Oft doth the wayward infant, then to leave you
==157==To the sharp rod of justice, so to draw you
==158==To shun such lewd assemblies as beget
==159==Unlawful riots and such traitorous acts,
==160==That, striking with the hand of private hate,
==161==Maim your dear country with a public wound:⁠—
==162==Oh God, that Mercy, whose majestic brow
==163==Should be unwrinkled, and that awful Justice,
==164==Which looketh through a vail of sufferance
==165==Upon the frailty of the multitude,
==166==Should with the clamors of outrageous wrongs
==167==Be stirred and wakened thus to punishment!⁠—
==168==But your deserved death he doth forgive:
==169==Who gives you life, pray all he long may live.

**ALL.**
==170==God save the king! God save the king!
==171==My good Lord Chancellor, and the Earl of Surrey!

*Exeunt.*
