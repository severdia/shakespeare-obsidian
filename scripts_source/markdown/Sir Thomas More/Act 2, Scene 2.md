## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Saint Martin’s-le-Grand.*

*Enter Lincoln, two Bettses, Williamson, Sherwin, and other, armed; Doll in a shirt of mail, a headpiece, sword, and buckler; a crew attending.*

**CLOWN.**
==1== Come, come; we’ll tickle their turnips, we’ll butter their boxes. Shall strangers rule the roost? Yes; but we’ll baste the roost. Come, come; aflaunt, aflaunt!

**GEORGE.**
==2== Brother, give place, and hear John Lincoln speak.

**CLOWN.**
==2==     Aye, Lincoln my leader,
==2==     And Doll my true breeder,
==2==     With the rest of our crew,
==2==     Shall ran tan tarra ran;
==2==     Do all they what they can.
==2==     Shall we be bobbed, braved? No:
==2==     Shall we be held under? No;
==2==     We are freeborne,
==2==     And do take scorn
==2==     To be used so.

**DOLL.**
==3== Peace there, I say! Hear Captain Lincoln speak. Keep silence, till we know his mind at large.

**CLOWN.**
==4== Then largely deliver; speak, bully. And he that presumes to interrupt thee in thy oration, this for him.

**LINCOLN.**
==5== Then, gallant bloods, you whose free souls do scorn
==6== To bear the inforced wrongs of aliens,
==7== Add rage to resolution, fire the houses
==8== Of these audacious strangers. This is St. Martin’s,
==9== And yonder dwells Mutas, a wealthy Piccardy,
==10== At the Green Gate,
==11== De Barde, Peter Van Hollocke, Adrian Martine,
==12== With many more outlandish fugitives.
==13== Shall these enjoy more privilege than we
==14== In our own country? Let’s, then, become their slaves.
==15== Since justice keeps not them in greater awe,
==16== We be ourselves rough ministers at law.

**CLOWN.**
==16==     Use no more swords,
==16==     Nor no more words,
==16==     But fire the houses;
==16==     Brave captain courageous,
==16==     Fire me their houses.

**DOLL.**
==17== Aye, for we may as well make bonfires on May Day as at Midsummer. We’ll alter the day in the calendar, and set it down in flaming letters.

**SHERWIN.**
==18== Stay!
==19== No, that would much endanger the whole city,
==20== Whereto I would not the least prejudice.

**DOLL.**
==21== No, nor I neither; so may mine own house be burned for company. I’ll tell ye what. We’ll drag the strangers into More fields, and there bombast them till they stink again.

**CLOWN.**
==22== And that’s soon done; for they smell for fear already.

**GEORGE.**
==23== Let some of us enter the strangers’ houses,
==24== And, if we find them there, then bring them forth.

**DOLL.**
==25== But if ye bring them forth ere ye find them, I’ll ne’er allow of that.

**CLOWN.**
==25==     Now, Mars, for thy honor,
==25==     Dutch or French,
==25==     So it be a wench,
==25==     I’ll upon her.

*Exeunt some and Sherwin.*

**WILLIAMSON.**
==26== Now, lads, sure shall we labor in our safety.
==27== I hear the Mayor hath gathered men in arms,
==28== And that Sheriff More an hour ago rised
==29== Some of the Privy Counsel in at Ludgate:
==30== Force now must make our peace, or else we fall;
==31== ’Twill soon be known we are the principal.

**DOLL.**
==32== And what of that? If thou beest afraid, husband, go home again, and hide they head; for, by the Lord, I’ll have a little sport, now we are at it.

**GEORGE.**
==33== Let’s stand upon our swords, and if they come,
==34== Receive them as they were our enemies.

*Enter Sherwin and the rest.*

**CLOWN.**
==35== A purchase, a purchase! We have found, we ha found⁠—

**DOLL.**
==36== What?

**CLOWN.**
==37== Nothing; not a French Fleming nor a Fleming French to be found; but all fled, in plain English.

**LINCOLN.**
==38== How now! Have you found any?

**SHERWIN.**
==39== No, not one; they’re all fled.

**LINCOLN.**
==40== Then fire the houses, that, the Mayor being busy
==41== About the quenching of them, we may escape;
==42== Burn down their kennels. Let us straight away,
==43== Least this day prove to us an ill May Day.

*Exeunt manet Clown.*

**CLOWN.**
==44== Fire, fire! I’ll be the first.
==45== If hanging come, ’tis welcome; that’s the worst.

*Exit.*
