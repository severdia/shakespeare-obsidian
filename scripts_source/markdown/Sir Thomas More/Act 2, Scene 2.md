## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Saint Martin’s-le-Grand.*

*Enter Lincoln, two Bettses, Williamson, Sherwin, and other, armed; Doll in a shirt of mail, a headpiece, sword, and buckler; a crew attending.*

**CLOWN.**
==1==Come, come; we’ll tickle their turnips, we’ll butter their boxes. Shall strangers rule the roost? Yes; but we’ll baste the roost. Come, come; aflaunt, aflaunt!

**GEORGE.**
==2==Brother, give place, and hear John Lincoln speak.

**CLOWN.**
==3==    Aye, Lincoln my leader,
==4==    And Doll my true breeder,
==5==    With the rest of our crew,
==6==    Shall ran tan tarra ran;
==7==    Do all they what they can.
==8==    Shall we be bobbed, braved? No:
==9==    Shall we be held under? No;
==10==    We are freeborne,
==11==    And do take scorn
==12==    To be used so.

**DOLL.**
==13==Peace there, I say! Hear Captain Lincoln speak. Keep silence, till we know his mind at large.

**CLOWN.**
==14==Then largely deliver; speak, bully. And he that presumes to interrupt thee in thy oration, this for him.

**LINCOLN.**
==15==Then, gallant bloods, you whose free souls do scorn
==16==To bear the inforced wrongs of aliens,
==17==Add rage to resolution, fire the houses
==18==Of these audacious strangers. This is St. Martin’s,
==19==And yonder dwells Mutas, a wealthy Piccardy,
==20==At the Green Gate,
==21==De Barde, Peter Van Hollocke, Adrian Martine,
==22==With many more outlandish fugitives.
==23==Shall these enjoy more privilege than we
==24==In our own country? Let’s, then, become their slaves.
==25==Since justice keeps not them in greater awe,
==26==We be ourselves rough ministers at law.

**CLOWN.**
==27==    Use no more swords,
==28==    Nor no more words,
==29==    But fire the houses;
==30==    Brave captain courageous,
==31==    Fire me their houses.

**DOLL.**
==32==Aye, for we may as well make bonfires on May Day as at Midsummer. We’ll alter the day in the calendar, and set it down in flaming letters.

**SHERWIN.**
==33==Stay!
==34==No, that would much endanger the whole city,
==35==Whereto I would not the least prejudice.

**DOLL.**
==36==No, nor I neither; so may mine own house be burned for company. I’ll tell ye what. We’ll drag the strangers into More fields, and there bombast them till they stink again.

**CLOWN.**
==37==And that’s soon done; for they smell for fear already.

**GEORGE.**
==38==Let some of us enter the strangers’ houses,
==39==And, if we find them there, then bring them forth.

**DOLL.**
==40==But if ye bring them forth ere ye find them, I’ll ne’er allow of that.

**CLOWN.**
==41==    Now, Mars, for thy honor,
==42==    Dutch or French,
==43==    So it be a wench,
==44==    I’ll upon her.

*Exeunt some and Sherwin.*

**WILLIAMSON.**
==45==Now, lads, sure shall we labor in our safety.
==46==I hear the Mayor hath gathered men in arms,
==47==And that Sheriff More an hour ago rised
==48==Some of the Privy Counsel in at Ludgate:
==49==Force now must make our peace, or else we fall;
==50==’Twill soon be known we are the principal.

**DOLL.**
==51==And what of that? If thou beest afraid, husband, go home again, and hide they head; for, by the Lord, I’ll have a little sport, now we are at it.

**GEORGE.**
==52==Let’s stand upon our swords, and if they come,
==53==Receive them as they were our enemies.

*Enter Sherwin and the rest.*

**CLOWN.**
==54==A purchase, a purchase! We have found, we ha found⁠—

**DOLL.**
==55==What?

**CLOWN.**
==56==Nothing; not a French Fleming nor a Fleming French to be found; but all fled, in plain English.

**LINCOLN.**
==57==How now! Have you found any?

**SHERWIN.**
==58==No, not one; they’re all fled.

**LINCOLN.**
==59==Then fire the houses, that, the Mayor being busy
==60==About the quenching of them, we may escape;
==61==Burn down their kennels. Let us straight away,
==62==Least this day prove to us an ill May Day.

*Exeunt manet Clown.*

**CLOWN.**
==63==Fire, fire! I’ll be the first.
==64==If hanging come, ’tis welcome; that’s the worst.

*Exit.*
