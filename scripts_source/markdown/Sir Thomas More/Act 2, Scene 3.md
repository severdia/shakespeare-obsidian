## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*The Guildhall.*

*Enter at one door Sir Thomas More and Lord Mayor; at another door Sir John Munday hurt.*

**LORD MAYOR.**
==1==What, Sir John Munday, are you hurt?

**MUNDAY.**
==2==A little knock, my lord. There was even now
==3==A sort of prentices playing at cudgels;
==4==I did command them to their masters’ houses;
==5==But now, I fear me, they are gone to join
==6==With Lincoln, Sherwin, and their dangerous train.

**MORE.**
==7==The captains of this insurrection
==8==Have taken themselves to arms, and came but now
==9==To both the Counters, where they have released
==10==Sundry indebted prisoners, and from thence
==11==I hear that they are gone into St. Martin’s,
==12==Where they intend to offer violence
==13==To the amazed Lombards. Therefore, my lord,
==14==If we expect the safety of the city,
==15==Tis time that force or parley do encounter
==16==With these displeasèd men.

*Enter Second Messenger.*

**LORD MAYOR.**
==17==How now! What news?

**2. MESS.**
==18==My lord, the rebels have broke open Newgate,
==19==From whence they have delivered many prisoners,
==20==Both felons and notorious murderers,
==21==That desperately cleave to their lawless train.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==22==Up with the drawbridge, gather some forces
==23==To Cornhill and Cheapside:—and, gentlemen,
==24==If diligence be weighed on every side,
==25==A quiet ebb will follow this rough tide.

*Enter Shrewsbury, Surrey, Palmer, and Cholmley.*

**SHREWSBURY.**
==26==Lord Mayor, his majesty, receiving notice
==27==Of this most dangerous insurrection,
==28==Hath sent my lord of Surrey and myself,
==29==Sir Thomas Palmer and our followers,
==30==To add unto your forces our best means
==31==For pacifying of this mutiny.
==32==In God’s name, then, set on with happy speed!
==33==The king laments, if one true subject bleed.

**SURREY.**
==34==I hear they mean to fire the Lombards’ houses:
==35==Oh power, what art thou in a madman’s eyes!
==36==Thou mak’st the plodding idiot bloody-wise.

**MORE.**
==37==My lords, I doubt not but we shall appease
==38==With a calm breath this flux of discontent:
==39==To call them to a parley, questionless⁠—

**PALMER.**
==40==May fall out good. ’Tis well said, Master More.

**MORE.**
==41==Let’s to these simple men; for many sweat
==42==Under this act, that knows not the law’s debt
==43==Which hangs upon their lives; for silly men
==44==Plod on they know not how, like a fool’s pen,
==45==That, ending, shows not any sentence writ,
==46==Linked but to common reason or slightest wit:
==47==These follow for no harm; but yet incur
==48==Self penalty with those that raised this stir.
==49==I’God’s name, on, to calm our private foes
==50==With breath of gravity, not dangerous blows!

*Exeunt.*
