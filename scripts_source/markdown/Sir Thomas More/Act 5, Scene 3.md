## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The Tower.*

*Enter Sir Thomas More, the Lieutenant, and a Servant attending, as in his chamber in the Tower.*

**MORE.**
==1== Master Lieutenant, is the warrant come?
==2== If it be so, a God’s name, let us know it.

**LIEU.**
==3== My lord, it is.

**MORE.**
==3==         ’Tis welcome, sir, to me
==4== With all my heart. His blessed will be done!

**LIEU.**
==5== Your wisdom, sir, hath been so well approved,
==6== And your fair patience in imprisonment
==7== Hath ever shewn such constancy of mind
==8== And Christian resolution in all troubles,
==9== As warrant us you are not unprepared.

**MORE.**
==10== No, Master Lieutenant;
==11== I thank my God, I have peace of conscience,
==12== Though the world and I are at a little odds:
==13== But we’ll be even now, I hope, ere long.
==14== When is the execution of your warrant?

**LIEU.**
==15== Tomorrow morning.

**MORE.**
==15==               So, sir, I thank ye;
==16== I have not lived so ill, I fear to die.
==17== Master Lieutenant,
==18== I have had a sore fit of the stone tonight;
==19== But the King hath sent me such a rare receipt,
==20== I thank him, as I shall not need to fear it much.

**LIEU.**
==21== In life and death still merry Sir Thomas More.

**MORE.**
==22== Sirrah fellow, reach me the urinal:
*(He gives it him.)*
==23== Ha! Let me see (there’s) gravel in the water;
==24== (And yet I see no grave danger in that) 
==25== The man were likely to live long enough,
==26== So pleased the king. Here, fellow, take it.

**SERVANT.**
==27== Shall I go with it to the doctor, sir?

**MORE.**
==28== No, save thy labor; we’ll cozen him of a fee:
==29== Thou shalt see me take a dram tomorrow morning,
==30== Shall cure the stone, I warrant; doubt it not.
==31== Master Lieutenant, what news of my Lord of Rochester?

**LIEU.**
==32== Yesterday morning was he put to death.

**MORE.**
==33== The peace of soul sleep with him!
==34== He was a learned and a reverend prelate,
==35== And a rich man, believe me.

**LIEU.**
==36== If he were rich, what is Sir Thomas More,
==37== That all this while hath been Lord Chancellor?

**MORE.**
==38== Say ye so, Master Lieutenant? What do ye think
==39== A man, that with my time had held my place,
==40== Might purchase?

**LIEU.**
==41== Perhaps, my lord, two thousand pound a year.

**MORE.**
==42== Master Lieutenant, I protest to you,
==43== I never had the means in all my life
==44== To purchase one poor hundred pound a year:
==45== I think I am the poorest Chancellor
==46== That ever was in England, though I could wish,
==47== For credit of the place, that my estate were better.

**LIEU.**
==48== It’s very strange.

**MORE.**
==48==            It will be found as true.
==49== I think, sir, that with most part of my coin
==50== I have purchased as strange commodities
==51== As ever you heard tell of in your life.

**LIEU.**
==52== Commodities, my lord!
==53== Might I (without offense) inquire of them?

**MORE.**
==54== Croutches, Master Lieutenant, and bare cloaks;
==55== For halting soldiers and poor needy scholars
==56== Have had my gettings in the Chancery:
==57== To think but what a cheat the crown shall have
==58== By my attainder! I prithee, if thou be’est a gentleman,
==59== Get but a copy of my inventory.
==60== That part of poet that was given me
==61== Made me a very unthrift;
==62== For this is the disease attends us all,
==63== Poets were never thrifty, never shall.

*Enter Lady More mourning, Daughters, Master Roper.*

**LIEU.**
==64== Oh, noble More!⁠—
==65== My lord, your wife, your son-in-law, and daughters.

**MORE.**
==66== Son Roper, welcome;—welcome, wife, and girls.
==67== Why do you weep? Because I live at ease?
==68== Did you not see, when I was Chancellor,
==69== I was so clogged with suitors every hour,
==70== I could not sleep, nor dine, nor sup in quiet?
==71== Here’s none of this; here I can sit and talk
==72== With my honest keeper half a day together,
==73== Laugh and be merry. Why, then, should you weep?

**ROPER.**
==74== These tears, my lord, for this your long restraint
==75== Hope had dried up, with comfort that we yet,
==76== Although imprisoned, might have had your life.

**MORE.**
==77== To live in prison, what a life were that!
==78== The king (I thank him) loves me more then so.
==79== Tomorrow I shall be at liberty
==80== To go even whether I can,
==81== After I have dispatched my business.

**LADY MORE.**
==82== Ah, husband, husband, yet submit yourself!
==83== Have care of your poor wife and children.

**MORE.**
==84== Wife, so I have; and I do leave you all
==85== To his protection hath the power to keep you
==86== Safer than I can,⁠—
==87== The father of the widow and the orphans.

**ROPER.**
==88== The world, my lord, hath ever held you wise;
==89== And ’t shall be no distaste unto your wisdom,
==90== To yield to the opinion of the state.

**MORE.**
==91== I have deceived myself, I must acknowledge;
==92== And, as you say, son Roper, to confess the same,
==93== It will be no disparagement at all.

**LADY MORE.**
==94== His highness shall be certified thereof
==95== Immediately.

*Offering to depart.*

**MORE.**
==96== Nay, hear me, wife; first let me tell ye how:
==97== I thought to have had a barber for my beard;
==98== Now, I remember, that were labor lost,
==99== The headsman now shall cut off head and all.

**ROP. WIFE.**
==100== Father, his majesty, upon your meek submission,
==101== Will yet (they say) receive you to his grace
==102== In as great credit as you were before.

**MORE.**
==103== Has appointed me to do a little business.
==104== If that were past, my girl, thou then shouldst see
==105== What I would say to him about that matter;
==106== But I shall be so busy until then,
==107== I shall not tend it.

**DAUGHTER.**
==108== Ah, my dear father!

**LADY MORE.**
==108==            Dear lord and husband!

**MORE.**
==109== Be comforted, good wife, to live and love my children;
==110== For with thee leave I all my care of them.
==111== Son Roper, for my sake that have loved thee well,
==112== And for her virtue’s sake, cherish my child.
==113== Girl, be not proud, but of thy husband’s love;
==114== Ever retain thy virtuous modesty;
==115== That modesty is such a comely garment
==116== As it is never out of fashion, sits as fair
==117== Upon the meaner woman as the empress;
==118== No stuff that gold can buy is half so rich,
==119== Nor ornament that so becomes a woman.
==120== Live all and love together, and thereby
==121== You give your father a rich obsequy.

**BOTH DAUGHTERS.**
==122== Your blessing, dear father.

**MORE.**
==123== I must be gone—God bless you!⁠—
==124== To talk with God, who now doth call.

**LADY MORE.**
==125== Aye, my dear husband!

**MORE.**
==125==            Sweet wife, good night, good night:
==126== God send us all his everlasting light!

**ROPER.**
==127== I think, before this hour,
==128== More heavy hearts ne’er parted in the Tower.

*Exeunt.*
