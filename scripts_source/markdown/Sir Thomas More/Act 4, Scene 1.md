## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Whitehall. The council chamber.*

*Enter the Earls of Shrewsbury, Surrey, Bishop of Rochester, and other Lords; severally, doing courtesy to each other.*

*Clerk of the Council waiting bareheaded.*

**SURREY.**
==1== Good morrow to my Lord of Shrewsbury.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==2== The like unto the honored Earl of Surrey.
==3== Yond comes my Lord of Rochester.

**ROCHESTER.**
==4== Good morrow, my good lords.

**SURREY.**
==5== Clerk of the Council, what time is’t of day?

**CLERK.**
==6== Past eight of clock, my lord.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==7== I wonder that my good Lord Chancellor
==8== Doth stay so long, considering there’s matters
==9== Of high importance to be scanned upon.

**SURREY.**
==10== Clerk of the Council, certify his lordship
==11== The lords expect him here.

**ROCHESTER.**
==11==                 It shall not need;
==12== Yond comes his lordship.

*Enter Sir Thomas More, with Purse and Mace borne before him.*

**MORE.**
==13== Good morrow to this fair assembly.
==14== Come, my good lords, let’s sit. Oh serious square!
*(They sit.)*
==15== Upon this little board is daily scanned
==16== The health and preservation of the land;
==17== We the physicians that effect this good,
==18== Now by choice diet, anon by letting blood;
==19== Our toil and careful watching brings the king
==20== In league with slumbers, to which peace doth sing.
==21== Avoid the room there!⁠—
==22== What business, lords, today?

**SHREWSBURY.**
==22==               This, my good lord;
==23== About the entertainment of the Emperor
==24== ’Gainst the perfidious French into our pay.

**SURREY.**
==25== My lords, as ’tis the custom in this place
==26== The youngest should speak first, so, if I chance
==27== In this case to speak youngly, pardon me.
==28== I will agree, France now hath her full strength,
==29== As having new recovered the pale blood
==30== Which war sluiced forth; and I consent to this,
==31== That the conjunction of our English forces
==32== With arms of Germany may soon bring
==33== This prize of conquest in. But, then, my lords,
==34== As in the moral hunting ’twixt the lion
==35== And other beasts, force joined with greed
==36== Frighted the weaker sharers from their parts;
==37== So, if the empire’s sovereign chance to put
==38== His plea of partnership into war’s court,
==39== Swords should decide the difference, and our blood
==40== In private tears lament his entertainment.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==41== To doubt the worst is still the wise man’s shield,
==42== That arms him safely. But the world knows this,
==43== The Emperor is a man of royal faith;
==44== His love unto our sovereign brings him down
==45== From his imperial seat, to march in pay
==46== Under our English flag, and wear the cross,
==47== Like some high order, on his manly breast;
==48== Thus serving, he’s not master of himself,
==49== But, like a colonel commanding other,
==50== Is by the general over-awed himself.

**ROCHESTER.**
==51== Yet, my good lord⁠—

**SHREWSBURY.**
==51==            Let me conclude my speech.
==52== As subjects share no portion in the conquest
==53== Of their true sovereign, other than the merit
==54== That from the sovereign guerdons the true subject;
==55== So the good Emperor, in a friendly league
==56== Of amity with England, will not soil
==57== His honor with the theft of English spoil.

**MORE.**
==58== There is no question but this entertainment
==59== Will be most honorable, most commodious.
==60== I have oft heard good captains wish to have
==61== Rich soldiers to attend them, such as would fight
==62== Both for their lives and livings; such a one
==63== Is the good Emperor. I would to God,
==64== We had ten thousand of such able men!
==65== Hah, then there would appear no court, no city,
==66== But, where the wars were, they would pay themselves.
==67== Then, to prevent in French wars England’s loss,
==68== Let German flags wave with our English cross.

*Enter Sir Thomas Palmer.*

**PALMER.**
==69== My lords, his majesty hath sent by me
==70== These articles enclosed, first to be viewed,
==71== And then to be subscribed to. I tender them
==72== In that due reverence which befits this place.

*With great reverence.*

**MORE.**
==73== Subscribe these articles! Stay, let us pause;
==74== Our conscience first shall parley with our laws.
==75== My Lord of Rochester, view you the paper.

**ROCHESTER.**
==76== Subscribe to these! Now, good Sir Thomas Palmer,
==77== Beseech the king that he will pardon me:
==78== My heart will check my hand whilst I do write;
==79== Subscribing so, I were an hypocrite.

**PALMER.**
==80== Do you refuse it, then, my lord?

**ROCHESTER.**
==80==                 I do, Sir Thomas.

**PALMER.**
==81== Then here I summon you forthwith t’ appear
==82== Before his majesty, to answer there
==83== This capital contempt.

**ROCHESTER.**
==83==                 I rise and part,
==84== In lieu of this to tender him my heart.

*He riseth.*

**PALMER.**
==85== Wilt please your honor to subscribe, my lord?

**MORE.**
==86== Sir, tell his highness, I entreat
==87== Some time for to bethink me of this task:
==88== In the meanwhile I do resign mine office
==89== Into my sovereign’s hands.

**PALMER.**
==89==                 Then, my lord,
==90== Hear the prepared order from the king:
==91== On your refusal, you shall straight depart
==92== Unto your house at Chelsea, till you know
==93== Our sovereign’s further pleasure.

**MORE.**
==93==                 Most willingly I go.
==94== My lords, if you will visit me at Chelsea,
==95== We’ll go a-fishing, and with a cunning net,
==96== Not like weak film, we’ll catch none but the great:
==97== Farewell, my noble lords. Why, this is right:
==98== Good morrow to the sun, to state good night!

*Exit More.*

**PALMER.**
==99== Will you subscribe, my lords?

**SURREY.**
==99==               Instantly, good Sir Thomas,
==100== We’ll bring the writing unto our sovereign.

*They write.*

**PALMER.**
==101== My Lord of Rochester,
==102== You must with me, to answer this contempt.

**ROCHESTER.**
==103== This is the worst,
==104== Who’s freed from life is from all care exempt.

*Exit Rochester and Palmer.*

**SURREY.**
==105== Now let us hasten to our sovereign.
==106== Tis strange that my Lord Chancellor should refuse
==107== The duty that the law of God bequeaths
==108== Unto the king.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==109== Come, let us in. No doubt
==110== His mind will alter, and the bishop’s too:
==111== Error in learned heads hath much to do.

*Exeunt.*
