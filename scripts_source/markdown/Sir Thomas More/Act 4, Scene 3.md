## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*The Tower.*

*Enter the Bishop of Rochester, Surrey, Shrewsbury, Lieutenant of the Tower, and Warders with weapons*

**ROCHESTER.**
==1== Your kind persuasions, honorable lords,
==2== I can but thank ye for; but in this breast
==3== There lives a soul that aims at higher things
==4== Than temporary pleasing earthly kings.
==5== God bless his highness even with all my heart!⁠—
==6== We shall meet one day, though that now we part.

**SURREY.**
==7== We not misdoubt, your wisdom can discern
==8== What best befits it; yet in love and zeal
==9== We could entreat, it might be otherwise.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==10== No doubt, your fatherhood will by yourself
==11== Consider better of the present case,
==12== And grow as great in favor as before.

**ROCHESTER.**
==13== For that, as pleaseth God. In my restraint
==14== From wordly causes, I shall better see
==15== Into myself than at proud liberty:
==16== The Tower and I will privately confer
==17== Of things, wherein at freedom I may err.
==18== But I am troublesome unto your honors,
==19== And hold ye longer than becomes my duty.
==20== Master Lieutenant, I am now your charge;
==21== And though you keep my body, yet my love
==22== Waits on my king and you, while Fisher lives.

**SURREY.**
==23== Farewell, my Lord of Rochester; we’ll pray
==24== For your release, and labor’t as we may.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==25== Thereof assure yourself; so do we leave ye,
==26== And to your happy private thoughts bequeath ye.

*Exeunt Lords.*

**ROCHESTER.**
==27== Now, Master Lieutenant, on; i’God’s name, go!
==28== And with as glad a mind go I with you
==29== As ever truant bade the school *adieu*.

*Exeunt.*
