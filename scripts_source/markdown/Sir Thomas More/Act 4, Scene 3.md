## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*The Tower.*

*Enter the Bishop of Rochester, Surrey, Shrewsbury, Lieutenant of the Tower, and Warders with weapons*

**ROCHESTER.**
Your kind persuasions, honorable lords,
I can but thank ye for; but in this breast
There lives a soul that aims at higher things
Than temporary pleasing earthly kings.
God bless his highness even with all my heart!⁠—
We shall meet one day, though that now we part.

**SURREY.**
We not misdoubt, your wisdom can discern
What best befits it; yet in love and zeal
We could entreat, it might be otherwise.

**SHREWSBURY.**
No doubt, your fatherhood will by yourself
Consider better of the present case,
And grow as great in favor as before.

**ROCHESTER.**
For that, as pleaseth God. In my restraint
From wordly causes, I shall better see
Into myself than at proud liberty:
The Tower and I will privately confer
Of things, wherein at freedom I may err.
But I am troublesome unto your honors,
And hold ye longer than becomes my duty.
Master Lieutenant, I am now your charge;
And though you keep my body, yet my love
Waits on my king and you, while Fisher lives.

**SURREY.**
Farewell, my Lord of Rochester; we’ll pray
For your release, and labor’t as we may.

**SHREWSBURY.**
Thereof assure yourself; so do we leave ye,
And to your happy private thoughts bequeath ye.

*Exeunt Lords.*

**ROCHESTER.**
Now, Master Lieutenant, on; i’God’s name, go!
And with as glad a mind go I with you
As ever truant bade the school *adieu*.

*Exeunt.*
