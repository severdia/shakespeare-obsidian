## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*London. The Sessions House.*

*An arras is drawn, and behind it as in sessions sit the Lord Mayor, Justice Suresby, and other Justices; Sheriff More and the other Sheriff sitting by. Smart is the plaintiff, Lifter the prisoner at the bar. Recorder, Officers.*

**LORD MAYOR.**
==1== Having dispatched our weightier businesses,
==2== We may give ear to petty felonies.
==3== Master Sheriff More, what is this fellow?

**MORE.**
==4== My lord, he stands indicted for a purse;
==5== He hath been tried, the jury is together.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==6== Who sent him in?

**SURESBY.**
==6==            That did I, my lord:
==7== Had he had right, he had been hanged ere this;
==8== The only captain of the cutpurse crew.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==9== What is his name?

**SURESBY.**
==10== As his profession is, Lifter, my lord,
==11== One that can lift a purse right cunningly.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==12== And is that he accuses him?

**SURESBY.**
==13== The same, my lord, whom, by your honors leave,
==14== I must say somewhat too, because I find
==15== In some respects he is well worthy blame.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==16== Good Master Justice Suresby, speak your mind;
==17== We are well pleased to give you audience.

**SURESBY.**
==18== Hear me, Smart; thou art a foolish fellow:
==19== If Lifter be convicted by the law,
==20== As I see not how the jury can acquit him,
==21== I’ll stand too ’t thou art guilty of his death.

**MORE.**
==22== My lord, that’s worthy the hearing.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==22==         Listen, then, good Master More.

**SURESBY.**
==23== I tell thee plain, it is a shame for thee,
==24== With such a sum to tempt necessity;
==25== No less than ten pounds, sir, will serve your turn,
==26== To carry in your purse about with ye,
==27== To crake and brag in taverns of your money:
==28== I promise ye, a man that goes abroad
==29== With an intent of truth, meeting such a booty,
==30== May be provoked to that he never meant.
==31== What makes so many pilferers and felons,
==32== But such fond baits that foolish people lay
==33== To tempt the needy miserable wretch?
==34== Ten pounds, odd money; this is a pretty sum
==35== To bear about, which were more safe at home.
==36== ’Fore God, ’twere well to fine ye as much more.
*(Lord Mayor and More whisper.)*
==37== To the relief of the poor prisoners,
==38== To teach ye be more careful of your own,
==39== In sooth, I say ye were but rightly served,
==40== If ye had lost as much as twice ten pounds.

**MORE.**
==41== Good my lord, sooth a point or two for once,
==42== Only to try conclusions in this case.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==43== Content, good Master More. We’ll rise awhile,
==44== And, till the jury can return their verdict,
==45== Walk in the garden. How say ye, Justices?

**ALL.**
==46== We like it well, my lord; we’ll follow ye.

*Exeunt Lord Mayor and Justices.*

**MORE.**
==47== Nay, plaintiff, go you too;—and officers,
*(Exit Smart.)*
==48== Stand you aside, and leave the prisoner
==49== To me awhile. Lifter, come hither.

**LIFTER.**
==50== What is your worship’s pleasure?

**MORE.**
==51== Sirrah, you know that you are known to me,
==52== And I have often saved ye from this place,
==53== Since first I came in office. Thou seest beside,
==54== That Justice Suresby is thy heavy friend,
==55== By all the blame that he pretends to Smart,
==56== For tempting thee with such a sum of money.
==57== I tell thee what; devise me but a means
==58== To pick or cut his purse, and, on my credit,
==59== And as I am a Christian and a man,
==60== I will procure they pardon for that jest.

**LIFTER.**
==61== Good Master Sheriff, seek not my overthrow:
==62== You know, sir, I have many heavy friends,
==63== And more indictments like to come upon me.
==64== You are too deep for me to deal withal;
==65== You are known to be one of the wisest men
==66== That is in England. I pray ye, Master Sheriff,
==67== Go not about to undermine my life.

**MORE.**
==68== Lifter, I am true subject to my king;
==69== Thou much mistak’st me. And, for thou shall not think
==70== I mean by this to hurt thy life at all,
==71== I will maintain the act when thou hast done it.
==72== Thou knowest there are such matters in my hands,
==73== As if I pleased to give them to the jury,
==74== I should not need this way to circumvent thee.
==75== All that I aim at is a merry jest:
==76== Perform it, Lifter, and expect my best.

**LIFTER.**
==77== I thank your worship. God preserve your life!
==78== But Master Justice Suresby is gone in;
==79== I know not how to come near where he is.

**MORE.**
==80== Let me alone for that; I’ll be thy setter;
==81== I’ll send him hither to thee presently,
==82== Under the color of thine own request
==83== Of private matters to acquaint him with.

**LIFTER.**
==84== If ye do so, sir, then let me alone;
==85== Forty to one but then his purse is gone.

**MORE.**
==86== Well said. But see that thou diminish not
==87== One penny of the money, but give it me;
==88== It is the cunning act that credits thee.

**LIFTER.**
==89== I will, good Master Sheriff, I assure ye.
*(Exit More.)*
==90== I see the purpose of this gentleman
==91== Is but to check the folly of the Justice,
==92== For blaming others in a desperate case,
==93== Wherein himself may fall as soon as any.
==94== To save my life, it is a good adventure:
==95== Silence there, ho! Now doth the Justice enter.

*Enter Justice Suresby.*

**SURESBY.**
==96== Now, sirrah, now, what is your will with me?
==97== Wilt thou discharge thy conscience like an honest man?
==98== What sayest to me, sirrah? Be brief, be brief.

**LIFTER.**
==99== As brief, sir, as I can.
*(Aside.)*
==100== If ye stand fair, I will be brief anon.

**SURESBY.**
==101== Speak out, and mumble not. What sayest thou, sirrah?

**LIFTER.**
==102== Sir, I am charged, as God shall be my comfort,
==103== With more than’s true.

**SURESBY.**
==104== Sir, sir, ye are indeed, with more than’s true,
==105== For you are flatly charged with felony;
==106== You’re charged with more than truth, and that is theft;
==107== More than a true man should be charged withal;
==108== Thou art a varlet, that’s no more than true.
==109== Trifle not with me; do not, do not, sirrah;
==110== Confess but what thou knowest, I ask no more.

**LIFTER.**
==111== There be, sir, there be, if’t shall please your worship⁠—

**SURESBY.**
==112== ‘There be,’ varlet! What be there? Tell me what there be.
==113== Come off or on. ‘There be!’ What be there, knave?

**LIFTER.**
==114== There be, sir, diverse very cunning fellows,
==115== That, while you stand and look them in the face,
==116== Will have your purse.

**SURESBY.**
==116==               Th’art an honest knave:
==117== Tell me what are they? Where they may be caught?
==118== Aye, those are they I look for.

**LIFTER.**
==118==               You talk of me, sir;
==119== Alas, I am a puny! There’s one indeed
==120== Goes by my name, he puts down all for purses;
==121== He’ll steal your worship’s purse under your nose.

**SURESBY.**
==122== Ha, ha! Art thou so sure, varlet?
==123== Well, well,
==124== Be as familiar as thou wilt, my knave;
==125== Tis this I long to know.

**LIFTER.**
==126== And you shall have your longing ere ye go.
==127== This fellow, sir, perhaps will meet ye thus,
==128== Or thus, or thus, and in kind compliment
==129== Pretend acquaintance, somewhat doubtfully;
==130== And these embraces serve⁠—

**SURESBY.**
==131== Aye, marry, Lifter, wherefore serve they?

*Shrugging gladly.*

**LIFTER.**
==132== Only to feel
==133== Whether you go full under sail or no,
==134== Or that your lading be aboard your bark.

**SURESBY.**
==135== In plainer English, Lifter, if my purse
==136== Be stored or no?

**LIFTER.**
==136==         Ye have it, sir.

**SURESBY.**
==136==                 Excellent, excellent.

**LIFTER.**
==137== Then, sir, you cannot but for manner’s sake
==138== Walk on with him; for he will walk your way,
==139== Alleging either you have much forgot him,
==140== Or he mistakes you.

**SURESBY.**
==141== But in this time has he my purse or no?

**LIFTER.**
==142== Not yet, sir, fie!⁠—
*(Aside.)*
==143== No, nor I have not yours.
*(Enter Lord Mayor, and c.)*
==144== But now we must forbear; my lords return.

**SURESBY.**
==145== A murrain on’t!—Lifter, we’ll more anon:
==146== Aye, thou sayest true, there are shrewd knaves indeed:
*(He sits down.)*
==147== But let them gull me, widgen me, rook me, fop me!
==148== I’faith, i’faith, they are too short for me.
==149== Knaves and fools meet when purses go:
==150== Wise men look to their purses well enough.

**MORE.**
*(Aside.)*
==151== Lifter, is it done?

**LIFTER.**
*(Aside.)*
==151==         Done, Master Sheriff; and there it is.

**MORE.**
*(Aside.)*
==152== Then build upon my word. I’ll save thy life.

**RECORDER.**
==153== Lifter, stand to the bar:
==154== The jury have returned the guilty; thou must die,
==155== According to the custom. Look to it, Master Shreeve.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==156== Then, gentlemen, as you are wont to do,
==157== Because as yet we have no burial place,
==158== What charity your meaning’s to bestow
==159== Toward burial of the prisoners now condemned,
==160== Let it be given. There is first for me.

**RECORDER.**
==161== And there for me.

**1. OFF.**
==161==            And me.

**SURESBY.**
==161==                   Body of me,
==162== My purse is gone!

**MORE.**
==162==            Gone, sir! What, here! How can that be?

**LORD MAYOR.**
==163== Against all reason, sitting on the bench.

**SURESBY.**
==164== Lifter, I talked with you; you have not lifted me? Ha?

**LIFTER.**
==165== Suspect ye me, sir? Oh, what a world is this!

**MORE.**
==166== But hear ye, master Suresby; are ye sure
==167== Ye had a purse about ye?

**SURESBY.**
==168== Sure, Master Sheriff! As sure as you are there,
==169== And in it seven pounds, odd money, on my faith.

**MORE.**
==170== Seven pounds, odd money! What, were you so mad,
==171== Being a wise man and a magistrate,
==172== To trust your purse with such a liberal sum?
==173== Seven pounds, odd money! ’Fore God, it is a shame,
==174== With such a sum to tempt necessity:
==175== I promise ye, a man that goes abroad
==176== With an intent of truth, meeting such a booty,
==177== May be wrought to that he never thought.
==178== What makes so many pilferers and felons,
==179== But these fond baits that foolish people lay
==180== To tempt the needy miserable wretch?
==181== Should he be taken now that has your purse,
==182== I’d stand to’t, you are guilty of his death;
==183== For, questionless, he would be cast by law.
==184== Twere a good deed to fine ye as much more,
==185== To the relief of the poor prisoners,
==186== To teach ye lock your money up at home.

**SURESBY.**
==187== Well, Master More, you are a merry man;
==188== I find ye, sir, I find ye well enough.

**MORE.**
==189== Nay, ye shall see, sir, trusting thus your money,
==190== And Lifter here in trial for like case,
==191== But that the poor man is a prisoner,
==192== It would be now suspected that he had it.
==193== Thus may ye see what mischief often comes
==194== By the fond carriage of such needless sums.

**LORD MAYOR.**
==195== Believe me, Master Suresby, this is strange,
==196== You, being a man so settled in assurance,
==197== Will fall in that which you condemned in other.

**MORE.**
==198== Well, Master Suresby, there’s your purse again,
==199== And all your money. Fear nothing of More;
==200== Wisdom still keeps the mean and locks the door.

*Exeunt.*
