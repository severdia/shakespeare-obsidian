## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Chelsea.*

*Enter the Lady More, her two Daughters, and Master Roper, as walking.*

**ROPER.**
==1==Madame, what ails ye for to look so sad?

**LADY MORE.**
==2==Troth, son, I know not what; I am not sick,
==3==And yet I am not well. I would be merry;
==4==But somewhat lies so heavy on heart,
==5==I cannot choose but sigh. You are a scholar;
==6==I pray ye, tell me, may one credit dreams?

**ROPER.**
==7==Why ask you that, dear madame?

**LADY MORE.**
==8==Because tonight I had the strangest dream
==9==That ere my sleep was troubled with. Methought ’twas night,
==10==And that the King and Queen went on the Thames
==11==In barges to hear music. My lord and I
==12==Were in a little boat methought,—Lord, Lord,
==13==What strange things live in slumbers!—and, being near,
==14==We grappled to the barge that bare the king.
==15==But after many pleasing voices spent
==16==In that still moving music house, methought
==17==The violence of the stream did sever us
==18==Quite from the golden fleet, and hurried us
==19==Unto the bridge, which with unused horror
==20==We entered at full tide. Thence some slight shoot
==21==Being carried by the waves, our boat stood still
==22==Just opposite the Tower, and there it turned
==23==And turned about, as when a whirl-pool sucks
==24==The circled waters. Methought that we both cried,
==25==Till that we sunk. Where arm in arm we died.

**ROPER.**
==26==Give no respect, dear madame, to fond dreams:
==27==They are but slight illusions of the blood.

**LADY MORE.**
==28==Tell me not all are so; for often dreams
==29==Are true diviners, either of good or ill:
==30==I cannot be in quiet till I hear
==31==How my lord fares.

**ROPER.**
*(Aside.)*
==31==           No it. Come hither, wife:
==32==I will not fright thy mother, to interpret
==33==The nature of a dream; but trust me, sweet,
==34==This night I have been troubled with thy father
==35==Beyond all thought.

**ROP. WIFE.**
==35==           Truly, and so have I:
==36==Methought I saw him here in Chelsea Church,
==37==Standing upon the roodloft, now defac’d;
==38==And whilst he kneeled and prayed before the image,
==39==It fell with him into the upper-choir,
==40==Where my poor father lay all stained in blood.

**ROPER.**
==41==Our dreams all meet in one conclusion,
==42==Fatal, I fear.

**LADY MORE.**
==43==What’s that you talk? I pray ye, let me know it.

**ROP. WIFE.**
==44==Nothing, good mother.

**LADY MORE.**
==45==This is your fashion still; I must know nothing.
==46==Call Master Catesby; he shall straight to court,
==47==And see how my lord does. I shall not rest,
==48==Until my heart leave panting on his breast.

*Enter Sir Thomas More merrily, Servants attending.*

**DAUGHTER.**
==49==See where my father comes, joyful and merry.

**MORE.**
==50==As seamen, having passed a troubled storm,
==51==Dance on the pleasant shore; so I—oh, I could speak
==52==Now like a poet! Now, afore God, I am passing light!⁠—
==53==Wife, give me kind welcome. Thou wast wont to blame
==54==My kissing when my beard was in the stubble;
==55==But I have been trimmed of late; I have had
==56==A smooth court shaving, in good faith, I have.
*(Daughters kneel.)*
==57==God bless ye!—Son Roper, give me your hand.

**ROPER.**
==58==Your honor’s welcome home.

**MORE.**
==58==                  Honor! Ha ha!
==59==And how dost, wife?

**ROPER.**
==59==           He bears himself most strangely.

**LADY MORE.**
==60==Will your lordship in?

**MORE.**
==60==           Lordship! No, wife, that’s gone:
==61==The ground was slight that we did lean upon.

**LADY MORE.**
==62==Lord, that your honor ne’er will leave these jests!
==63==In faith, it ill becomes ye.

**MORE.**
==63==                  Oh, good wife,
==64==Honor and jests are both together fled;
==65==The merriest councillor of England’s dead.

**LADY MORE.**
==66==Who’s that, my lord?

**MORE.**
==66==           Still lord! The Lord Chancellor, wife.

**LADY MORE.**
==67==That’s you.

**MORE.**
==67==    Certain; but I have changed my life.
==68==Am I not leaner than I was before?
==69==The fat is gone; my title’s only More.
==70==Contented with one style, I’ll live at rest:
==71==They that have many names are not still best.
==72==I have resigned mine office. Count’st me not wise?

**LADY MORE.**
==73==Oh God!

**MORE.**
==74==Come, breed not female children in your eyes:
==75==The king will have it so.

**LADY MORE.**
==75==           What’s the offense?

**MORE.**
==76==Tush, let that pass; we’ll talk of that anon.
==77==The king seems a physician to my fate;
==78==His princely mind would train me back to state.

**ROPER.**
==79==Then be his patient, my most honored father.

**MORE.**
==80==Oh, son Roper,
==81==*Ubi turpis est medicine, sanari piget!—*
==82==No, wife, be merry;—and be merry, all:
==83==You smiled at rising, weep not at my fall.
==84==Let’s in, and hear joy like to private friends,
==85==Since days of pleasure have repentant ends:
==86==The light of greatness is with triumph born;
==87==It sets at midday oft with public scorn.

*Exeunt.*
