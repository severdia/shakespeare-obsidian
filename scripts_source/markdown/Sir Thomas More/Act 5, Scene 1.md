## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*The Tower Gate.*

*Enter the Warders of the Tower, with halberds.*

**1. WARDER**
==1== Ho, make a guard there!

**2. WARDER.**
==2== Master Lieutenant gives a straight command,
==3== The people be avoided from the bridge.

**3. WARDER.**
==4== From whence is he committed, who can tell?

**1. WARDER**
==5== From Durham House, I hear.

**2. WARDER.**
==6== The guard were waiting there are hour ago.

**3. WARDER.**
==7== If he stay long, he’ll not get near the wharf,
==8== There’s such a crowd of boats upon the Thames.

**2. WARDER.**
==9== Well, be it spoken without offense to any,
==10== A wiser or more virtuous gentleman
==11== Was never bred in England.

**3. WARDER.**
==12== I think, the poor will bury him in tears:
==13== I never heard a man, since I was born,
==14== So generally bewailed of every one.
*(Enter a Poor Woman.)*
==15== What means this woman?—Whether dost thou press?

**1. WARDER**
==16== This woman will be trod to death anon.

**2. WARDER.**
==17== What makest thou here?

**POOR WOMAN.**
==18== To speak with that good man, Sir Thomas More.

**2. WARDER.**
==19== To speak with him! He’s not Lord Chancellor.

**POOR WOMAN.**
==20== The more’s the pity, sir, if it pleased God.

**2. WARDER.**
==21== Therefore, if thou hast a petition to deliver,
==22== Thou mayst keep it now, for any thing I know.

**POOR WOMAN.**
==23== I am a poor woman, and have had (God knows) 
==24== A suit this two year in the Chancery;
==25== And he hath all the evidence I have
==26== Which should I lose, I am utterly undone.

**2. WARDER.**
==27== Faith, and I fear thoult hardly come by am now;
==28== I am sorry for thee, even with all my heart.
*(Enter the Lords of Shrewsbury and Surrey with Sir Thomas More, and Attendants, and enter Lieutenant and Gentleman Porter.)*
==29== Woman, stand back, you must avoid this place;
==30== The lords must pass this way into the Tower.

**MORE.**
==31== I thank your lordships for your pains thus far
==32== To my strong house.

**POOR WOMAN.**
==33== Now, good Sir Thomas More, for Christ’s dear sake,
==34== Deliver me my writings back again
==35== That do concern my title.

**MORE.**
==36== What, my old client, are thou got hither too?
==37== Poor silly wretch, I must confess indeed,
==38== I had such writings as concern thee near;
==39== But the king has ta’en the matter into his own hand;
==40== He has all I had. Then, woman, sue to him;
==41== I cannot help thee; thou must bear with me.

**POOR WOMAN.**
==42== Ah, gentle heart, my soul for thee is sad!
==43== Farewell the best friend that the poor e’er had.

*Exit Woman.*

**GENTLEMAN PORTER.**
==44== Before you enter through the Towergate,
==45== Your upper garment, sir, belongs to me.

**MORE.**
==46== Sir, you shall have it; there it is.

*He gives him his cap.*

**GENTLEMAN PORTER.**
==47== The upmost on your back, sir; you mistake me.

**MORE.**
==48== Sir, now I understand ye very well:
==49== But that you name my back,
==50== Sure else my cap had been the uppermost.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==51== Farewell, kind lord; God send us merry meeting!

**MORE.**
==52== Amen, my lord.

**SURREY.**
==53== Farewell, dear friend; I hope your safe return.

**MORE.**
==54== My lord, and my dear fellow in the Muses,
==55== Farewell; farewell, most noble poet.

**LIEU.**
==56== *Adieu*, most honored lords.

*Exeunt Lords.*

**MORE.**
==57== Fair prison, welcome; yet, methinks,
==58== For thy fair building ’tis too foul a name.
==59== Many a guilty soul, and many an innocent,
==60== Have breathed their farewell to thy hollow rooms.
==61== I oft have entered into thee this way;
==62== Yet, I thank God, ne’er with a clear conscience
==63== Than at this hour:
==64== This is my comfort yet, how hard soe’er
==65== My lodging prove, the cry of the poor suitor,
==66== Fatherless orphan, or distressed widow,
==67== Shall not disturb me in my quiet sleep.
==68== On, then, i’God’s name, to our close abode!
==69== God is as strong here as he is abroad.

*Exeunt.*
