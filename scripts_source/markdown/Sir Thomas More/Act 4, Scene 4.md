## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Chelsea. A room in More’s house.*

*Enter Sir Thomas More, his Lady, Daughters, Master Roper, Gentlemen, and Servants, as in his house at Chelsea.*

**MORE.**
==1==Good morrow, good son Roper.
==2==Sit, good madame,
*(Low stools.)*
==3==Upon an humble seat; the time so craves;
==4==Rest your good heart on earth, the roof of graves:
==5==You see the floor of greatness is uneven;
==6==The cricket and high throne alike near heaven.
==7==Now, daughters, you that like to branches spread,
==8==And give best shadow to a private house,
==9==Be comforted, my girls; your hopes stand fair:
==10==Virtue breeds gentry, she makes the best heir.

**BOTH DAUGHTERS.**
==11==Good morrow to your honor.

**MORE.**
==11==              Nay, good night rather;
==12==Your honor’s crest-fain with your happy father.

**ROPER.**
==13==Oh, what formality, what square observance,
==14==Lives in a little room! Here public care
==15==Gags not the eyes of slumber; here fierce riot
==16==Ruffles not proudly in a coat of trust,
==17==Whilst, like a pawn at chess, he keeps in rank
==18==With kings and mighty fellows; yet indeed
==19==Those men that stand on tiptoe smile to see
==20==Him pawn his fortunes.

**MORE.**
==20==              True, son,⁠—
==21==Nor does the wanton tongue here screw itself
==22==Into the ear, that like a vise drinks up
==23==The iron instrument.

**LADY MORE.**
==23==           We are here at peace.

**MORE.**
==24==Then peace, good wife.

**LADY MORE.**
==25==For, keeping still in compass, a strange point
==26==In times new navigation we have sailed
==27==Beyond our course.

**MORE.**
==27==           Have done.

**LADY MORE.**
==28==We are exiled the court.

**MORE.**
==28==              Still thou harpest on that:
==29==’Tis sin for to deserve that banishment;
==30==But he that ne’er knew court, courts sweet content.

**LADY MORE.**
==31==Oh, but, dear husband⁠—

**MORE.**
==31==           I will not hear thee, wife;
==32==The winding labyrinth of thy strange discourse
==33==Will ne’er have end. Sit still; and, my good wife,
==34==Entreat thy tongue be still; or, credit me,
==35==Thou shalt not understand a word we speak;
==36==We’ll talk in Latin.
==37==*Humida vallis raros patitur fulminis ictus,*
==38==More rest enjoys the subject meanly bred
==39==Than he that bears the kingdom in his head.
==40==Great men are still musicians, else the world lies;
==41==They learn low strains after the notes that rise.

**ROPER.**
==42==Good sir, be still yourself, and but remember
==43==How in this general court of short-lived pleasure,
==44==The world, creation is the ample food
==45==That is digested in the maw of time:
==46==If man himself be subject to such ruin,
==47==How shall his garment, then, or the loose points
==48==That tie respect unto his awful place,
==49==Avoid destruction? Most honored father-in-law,
==50==The blood you have bequeathed these several hearts
==51==To nourish your posterity, stands firm;
==52==And, as with joy you led us first to rise,
==53==So with like hearts we’ll lock preferment’s eyes.

**MORE.**
==54==Close them not, then, with tears. For that ostent
==55==Gives a wet signal of your discontent.
==56==If you will share my fortunes, comfort then;
==57==An hundred smiles for one sigh. What! We are men:
==58==Resign wet passion to these weaker eyes,
==59==Which proves their sex, but grants it ne’er more wise.
==60==Let’s now survey our state. Here sits my wife,
==61==And dear esteemed issue; yonder stand
==62==My loving servants. Now the difference
==63==Twixt those and these. Now you shall hear my speak
==64==Like More in melancholy. I conceive that nature
==65==Hath sundry metals, out of which she frames
==66==Us mortals, each in valuation
==67==Outprizing other. Of the finest stuff
==68==The finest features come. The rest of earth,
==69==Receive base fortune even before their birth;
==70==Hence slaves have their creation; and I think
==71==Nature provides content for the base mind;
==72==Under the whip, the burden, and the toil,
==73==Their low-wrought bodies drudge in patience;
==74==As for the prince in all his sweet-gorged maw,
==75==And his rank flesh, that sinfully renews
==76==The noon’s excess in the night’s dangerous surfeits.
==77==What means or misery from our birth doth flow
==78==Nature entitles to us; that we owe:
==79==But we, being subject to the rack of hate,
==80==Falling from happy life to bondage state,
==81==Having seen better days, now know the lack
==82==Of glory that once reared each high-fed back.
==83==But you, that in your age did ne’er view better,
==84==Challenged not fortune for your thriftless debter.

**CATESBY.**
==85==Sir, we have seen far better days than these.

**MORE.**
==86==I was the patron of those days, and know
==87==Those were but painted days, only for show.
==88==Then grieve not you to fall with him that gave them:
==89==*Generosis servis gloriosum mori.*
==90==Dear Gough, thou art my learned secretary;
==91==You, Master Catesby, steward of my house;
==92==The rest like you have had fair time to grow
==93==In sun-shine of my fortunes. But I must tell ye,
==94==Corruption is fled hence with each man’s office;
==95==Bribes, that make open traffic twixt the soul
==96==And netherland of hell, deliver up
==97==Their guilty homage to the second lords.
==98==Then, living thus untainted, you are well:
==99==Truth is no pilot for the land of hell.

*Enter a Servant.*

**SERVANT.**
==100==My lord, there are new lighted at the gate
==101==The Earls of Surrey and of Shrewsbury,
==102==And they expect you in the inner court.

**MORE.**
==103==Entreat their lordships come into the hall.

*Exit Servant.*

**LADY MORE.**
==104==Oh, God, what news with them?

**MORE.**
==104==                Why, how now, wife!
==105==They are but come to visit their old friend.

**LADY MORE.**
==106==Oh, God, I fear, I fear!

**MORE.**
==107==What shouldst thou fear, fond woman?
==108==*Justum, si fractus illabatur orbis, inpavidum ferient ruinae.*
==109==Here let me live estranged from great men’s looks;
==110==They are like golden flies on leaden hooks.

*Enter the Earls, Downes with his mace, and Attendants.*

**SHREWSBURY.**
==111==Good morrow, good Sir Thomas.

*Kind salutations.*

**SURREY.**
==112==Good day, good madame.

**MORE.**
==112==              Welcome, my good lords.
==113==What ails your lordships look so melancholy?
==114==Oh, I know; you live in court, and the court diet
==115==Is only friend to physic.

**SURREY.**
==115==              Oh, Sir Thomas,
==116==Our words are now the King’s, and our sad looks
==117==The interest of your love! We are sent to you
==118==From our mild sovereign, once more to demand
==119==If you’ll subscribe unto those articles
==120==He sent ye th’ other day. Be well advised;
==121==For, on mine honor, lord, grave Doctor Fisher,
==122==Bishop of Rochester, at the self same instant
==123==Attached with you, is sent unto the Tower
==124==For the like obstinacy. His majesty
==125==Hath only sent you prisoner to your house;
==126==But, if you now refuse for to subscribe,
==127==A stricter course will follow.

**LADY MORE.**
==128==Oh, dear husband!

*Kneeling and weeping.*

**BOTH DAUGHTERS.**
==128==           Dear father!

**MORE.**
==128==                  See, my lords,
==129==This partner and these subjects to my flesh
==130==Prove rebels to my conscience! But, my good lords,
==131==If I refuse, must I unto the Tower?

**SHREWSBURY.**
==132==You must, my lord; here is an officer
==133==Ready for to arrest you of high treason.

**LADY MORE AND DAUGHTERS.**
==134==Oh, God, oh, God!

**ROPER.**
==134==           Be patient, good madam.

**MORE.**
==135==Aye, Downs, is’t thou? I once did save thy life,
==136==When else by cruel riotous assault
==137==Thou hadst been torn in pieces. Thou art reserved
==138==To be my summoner to yond spiritual court.
==139==Give me thy hand; good fellow, smooth thy face:
==140==The diet that thou drinkst is spic’d with mace,
==141==And I could ne’er abide it; ’twill not digest,
==142==’Twill lie too heavily, man, on my weak breast.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==143==Be brief, my lord, for we are limited
==144==Unto an hour.

**MORE.**
==144==        Unto an hour! ’Tis well:
==145==The bell soon shall toll my knell.

**LADY MORE.**
==146==Dear loving husband, if you respect not me,
==147==Yet think upon your daughters.

*Kneeling.*

**MORE.**
==148==Wife, stand up; I have bethought me,
==149==And I’ll now satisfy the king’s good pleasure.

*Pointing to himself.*

**BOTH DAUGHTERS.**
==150==Oh, happy alteration!

**SHREWSBURY.**
==151==Come, then, subscribe, my lord.

**SURREY.**
==151==                  I am right glad
==152==Of this your fair conversion.

**MORE.**
==152==              Oh, pardon me!
==153==I will subscribe to go unto the Tower
==154==With all submissive willingness, and thereto add
==155==My bones to strengthen the foundation
==156==Of Julius Caesar’s palace. Now, my lord,
==157==I’ll satisfy the king, even with my blood;
==158==Now will I wrong your patience. Friend, do thine office.

**DOWNES.**
==159==Sir Thomas More, Lord Chancellor of England, I arrest you in the King’s name of high treason.

**MORE.**
==160==Gramercies, friend.
==161==To a great prison, to discharge the strife
==162==Commenc’d ’twixt conscience and my frailer life,
==163==More now must march. Chelsea, *adieu, adieu*!
==164==Strange farewell! Thou shalt ne’er more see More true,
==165==For I shall ne’er see thee more. Servants, farewell.
==166==Wife, mar not thine indifferent face; be wise:
==167==More’s widow’s husband, he must make thee rise.
==168==Daughters—what’s here, what’s here?
==169==Mine eye had almost parted with a tear.
==170==Dear son, possess my virtue, that I ne’er gave.
==171==Grave More thus lightly walks to a quick grave.

**ROPER.**
==172==*Curae leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent.*

**MORE.**
==173==You that way in; mind you my course in prayer:
==174==By water I to prison, to heaven through air.

*Exeunt.*
