## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]]

*Tower Hill.*

*Enter the Sheriffs of London and their Officers at one door, the Warders with their halberds at another.*

**2. SHERIFF.**
==1== Officers, what time of day is’t?

**1. OFF.**
==2== Almost eight o’clock.

**2. SHERIFF.**
==3== We must make haste then, least we stay too long.

**2. WARDER.**
==4== Good morrow, Master Sheriffs of London; Master Lieutenant
==5== Wills ye repair to the limits of the Tower,
==6== There to receive your prisoner.

**1. SHERIFF.**
==7== Go back, and tell his worship we are ready.

**2. SHERIFF.**
==8== Go bid the officers make clear the way,
==9== There may be passage for the prisoner.

*Enter Lieutenant and his Guard, with More.*

**MORE.**
==10== Yet, God be thanked, here’s a fair day toward,
==11== To take our journey in. Master Lieutenant,
==12== It were fair walking on the Tower leads.

**LIEU.**
==13== And so it might have liked my sovereign lord,
==14== I would to God you might have walked there still!

*He weeps.*

**MORE.**
==15== Sir, we are walking to a better place.
==16== Oh, sir, your kind and loving tears
==17== Are like sweet odors to embalm your friend!
==18== Thank your good lady; since I was your guest,
==19== She has made me a very wanton, in good sooth.

**LIEU.**
==20== Oh, I had hoped we should not yet have parted!

**MORE.**
==21== But I must leave ye for a little while;
==22== Within an hour or two you may look for me;
==23== But there will be so many come to see me,
==24== That I shall be so proud, I will not speak;
==25== And, sure, my memory is grown so ill,
==26== I fear I shall forget my head behind me.

**LIEU.**
==27== God and his blessed angels be about ye!⁠—
==28== Here, Master Sheriffs, receive your prisoner.

**MORE.**
==29== Good morrow, Master Sheriffs of London, to ye both:
==30== I thank ye that ye will vouchsafe to meet me;
==31== I see by this you have not quite forgot
==32== That I was in times past, as you are now,
==33== A sheriff of London.

**2. SHERIFF.**
==34== Sir, then you know our duty doth require it.

**MORE.**
==35== I know it well, sir, else I would have been glad
==36== You might have saved a labor at this time.
*(To the Second Sheriff.)*
==37== Ah, Master Sheriff,
==38== You and I have been of old acquaintance!
==39== You were a patient auditor of mine,
==40== When I read the divinity lecture at St. Lawrence’s.

**2. SHERIFF.**
==41== Sir Thomas More, I have heard you oft,
==42== As many other did, to our great comfort.

**MORE.**
==43== Pray God, you may so now, with all my heart!
==44== And, as I call to mind,
==45== When I studied the law in Lincoln’s Inn,
==46== I was of council with ye in a cause.

**2. SHERIFF.**
==47== I was about to say so, good Sir Thomas...

*They pass over the stage. Enter the Hangman.*

**MORE.**
==48== Oh, is this the place?
==49== I promise ye, it is a goodly scaffold:
==50== In sooth, I am come about a headless errand,
==51== For I have not much to say, now I am here.
==52== Well, let’s ascend, i’God’s name:
==53== In troth, methinks, your stair is somewhat weak;
==54== I prithee, honest friend, lend me thy hand
==55== To help me up; as for my coming down,
==56== Let me alone, I’ll look to that myself.
*(As he is going up the stairs, enters the Earls of Surrey and Shrewsbury.)*
==57== My Lords of Surrey and Shrewsbury, give me your hands. Yet before we...ye see, though it pleaseth the king to raise me thus high, yet I am not proud, for the higher I mount, the better I can see my friends about me. I am now on a far voyage, and this strange wooden horse must bear me thither; yet I perceive by your looks you like my bargain so ill, that there’s not one of ye all dare enter with me. Truly, here’s a most sweet gallery;
*(Walking.)*
==58== I like the air of it better than my garden at Chelsea. By your patience, good people, that have pressed thus into my bedchamber, if you’ll not trouble me, I’ll take a sound sleep here.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==59== My lord, ’twere good you’ld publish to the world
==60== Your great offense unto his majesty.

**MORE.**
==61== My lord, I’ll bequeath this legacy to the hangman, and do it instantly.
*(Gives the Hangman his gown.)*
==62== I confess, his majesty hath been ever good to me; and my offense to his highness makes me of a state pleader a stage player (though I am old, and have a bad voice), to act this last scene of my tragedy. I’ll send him (for my trespass) a reverend head, somewhat bald; for it is not requisite any head should stand covered to so high majesty. If that content him not, because I think my body will then do me small pleasure, let him but bury it, and take it.

**SURREY.**
==63== My lord, my lord, hold conference with your soul;
==64== You see, my lord, the time of life is short.

**MORE.**
==65== I see it, my good lord; I dispatched that business the last night. I come hither only to be let blood; my doctor here tells me it is good for the headache.

**HANGMAN.**
==66== I beseech thee, my lord, forgive me!

**MORE.**
==67== Forgive thee, honest fellow! Why?

**HANGMAN.**
==68== For your death, my lord.

**MORE.**
==69== O, my death? I had rather it were in thy power to forgive me, for thou hast the sharpest action against me; the law, my honest friend, lies in thy hands now. Here’s thy fee;
*(Gives his purse.)*
==70== and, my good fellow, let my suit be dispatched presently; for ’tis all one pain, to die a lingering death, and to live in the continual mill of a lawsuit. But I can tell thee, my neck is so short, that, if thou shouldst behead an hundred noblemen like myself, thou wouldst ne’er get credit by it; therefore (look ye, sir), do it handsomely, or, of my word, thou shalt never deal with me hereafter.

**HANGMAN.**
==71== I’ll take an order for that, my lord.

**MORE.**
==72== One thing more; take heed thou cutst not off my beard. Oh, I forgot; execution passed upon that last night, and the body of it lies buried in the Tower. Stay; is’t not possible to make a scape from all this strong guard? It is.
==73== There is a thing within me, that will raise
==74== And elevate my better part ’bove sight
==75== Of these same weaker eyes; and, Master Sheriffs,
==76== For all this troop of steel that tends my death,
==77== I shall break from you, and fly up to heaven.
==78== Let’s seek the means for this.

**HANGMAN.**
==79== My lord, I pray ye, put off your doublet.

**MORE.**
==80== Speak not so coldly to me; I am hoarse already;
==81== I would be loathe, good fellow, to take more.
==82== Point me the block; I ne’er was here before.

**HANGMAN.**
==83== To the east side, my lord.

**MORE.**
==83==               Then to the east
==84== We go to sigh; that o’er, to sleep in rest.
==85== Here More forsakes all mirth; good reason why;
==86== The fool of flesh must with her frail life die.
==87== No eye salute my trunk with a sad tear:
==88== Our birth to heaven should be thus, void of fear.

*Exit with Hangman, etc.*

**SURREY.**
==89== A very learned worthy gentleman
==90== Seals error with his blood. Come, we’ll to court.
==91== Let’s sadly hence to perfect unknown fates,
==92== Whilst he tends prograce to the state of states.

*Exit.*
