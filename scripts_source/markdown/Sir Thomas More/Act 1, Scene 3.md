## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*London. A state apartment.*

*Enter the Earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey, Sir Thomas Palmer, and Sir Roger Cholmley.*

**SHREWSBURY.**
==1==My lord of Surrey, and Sir Thomas Palmer
==2==Might I with patience tempt your grave advice,
==3==I tell ye true, that in these dangerous times
==4==I do not like this frowning vulgar brow:
==5==My searching eye did never entertain
==6==A more distracted countenance of grief
==7==Than I have late observed
==8==In the displeased commons of the city.

**SURREY.**
==9==’Tis strange that from his princely clemency,
==10==So well a tempered mercy and a grace,
==11==To all the aliens in this fruitful land,
==12==That this high-crested insolence should spring
==13==From them that breathe from his majestic bounty,
==14==That, fattened with the traffic of our country,
==15==Already leaps into his subjects’ face.

**PALMER.**
==16==Yet Sherwin, hindered to commence his suit
==17==Against de Barde by the ambassador,
==18==By supplication made unto the king,
==19==Who, having first enticed away his wife
==20==And got his plate, near worth four hundred pound,
==21==To grieve some wronged citizens that found
==22==This vile disgrace oft cast into their teeth,
==23==Of late sues Sherwin, and arrested him
==24==For money for the boarding of his wife.

**SURREY.**
==25==The more knave Barde, that, using Sherwin’s goods,
==26==Doth ask him interest for the occupation.
==27==I like not that, my lord of Shrewsbury:
==28==He’s ill bested that lends a well-paced horse
==29==Unto a man that will not find him meet.

**CHOLMLEY.**
==30==My lord of Surrey will be pleasant still.

**PALMER.**
==31==Aye, being then employed by your honors
==32==To stay the broil that fell about the same,
==33==Where by persuasion I enforced the wrongs,
==34==And urged the grief of the displeased city,
==35==He answered me, and with a solemn oath,
==36==That, if he had the Mayor of London’s wife,
==37==He would keep her in despite of any English.

**SURREY.**
==38==’Tis good, Sir Thomas, then, for you and me;
==39==Your wife is dead, and I a bachelor:
==40==If no man can possess his wife alone,
==41==I am glad, Sir Thomas Palmer, I have none.

**CHOLMLEY.**
==42==If a take a wife, ’a shall find her meet.

**SURREY.**
==43==And reason good, Sir Roger Cholmley, too.
==44==If these hot Frenchmen needsly will have sport,
==45==They should in kindness yet defray the charge:
==46==’Tis hard when men possess our wives in quiet,
==47==And yet leave us in, to discharge their diet.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==48==My lord, our caters shall not use the market
==49==For our provision, but some stranger now
==50==Will take the vittailes from him he hath bought:
==51==A carpenter, as I was late informed,
==52==Who having bought a pair of doves in Cheap,
==53==Immediately a Frenchman took them from him,
==54==And beat the poor man for resisting him;
==55==And when the fellow did complain his wrongs,
==56==He was severely punished for his labor.

**SURREY.**
==57==But if the English blood be once but up,
==58==As I perceive their hearts already full,
==59==I fear me much, before their spleens be cold,
==60==Some of these saucy aliens for their pride
==61==Will pay for ’t soundly, wheresoe’er it lights:
==62==This tide of rage that with the eddy strives,
==63==I fear me much, will drown too many lives.

**CHOLMLEY.**
==64==Now, afore God, your honors, pardon me:
==65==Men of your place and greatness are to blame.
==66==I tell ye true, my lords, in that his majesty
==67==Is not informed of this base abuse
==68==And daily wrongs are offered to his subjects;
==69==For, if he were, I know his gracious wisdom
==70==Would soon redress it.

*Enter First Messenger.*

**SHREWSBURY.**
==71==Sirrah, what news?

**CHOLMLEY.**
==71==           None good, I fear.

**1. MESS.**
==72==My lord, ill news; and worse, I fear, will follow,
==73==If speedily it be not looked unto:
==74==The city is in an uproar, and the Mayor
==75==Is threatened, if he come out of his house.
==76==A number poor artificers are up
==77==In arms and threaten to avenge their wrongs.

**CHOLMLEY.**
==78==We feared what this would come unto:
==79==This follows on the doctor’s publishing
==80==The bill of wrongs in public at the Spittle.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==81==That Doctor Beale may chance beshrew himself
==82==For reading of the bill.

**PALMER.**
==83==Let us go gather forces to the Mayor,
==84==For quick suppressing this rebellious route.

**SURREY.**
==85==Now I bethink myself of Master More,
==86==One of the sheriffs, a wise and learned gentleman,
==87==And in especial favor with the people:
==88==He, backed with other grave and sober men,
==89==May by his gentle and persuasive speech
==90==Perhaps prevail more than we can with power.

**SHREWSBURY.**
==91==Believe me, but your honor well advises:
==92==Let us make haste; for I do greatly fear
==93==Some of their graves this morning’s work will bear.

*Exeunt.*
