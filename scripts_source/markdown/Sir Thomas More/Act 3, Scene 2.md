## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Chelsea. Antechamber in More’s house.*

*Enter Third Messenger to More.*

**3. MESS.**
==1==My honorable lord, the Mayor of London,
==2==Accompanied with his lady and her train,
==3==Are coming hither, and are hard at hand,
==4==To feast with you. A servant’s come before,
==5==To tell your lordship of there near approach.

**MORE.**
==6==Why, this is cheerful news. Friends go and come:
==7==Reverend Erasmus, who delicious words
==8==Express the very soul and life of wit,
==9==Newly took sad leave of me, and with tears
==10==Troubled the silver channel of the Thames,
==11==Which, glad of such a burden, proudly swelled
==12==And on her bosom bore him toward the sea:
==13==He’s gone to Rotterdam; peace go with him!
==14==He left me heavy when he went from hence;
==15==But this recomforts me; the kind Lord Mayor,
==16==His brethren aldermen, with their fair wives,
==17==Will feast this night with us. Why, so it should be;
==18==More’s merry heart lives by good company.
==19==Good gentlemen, be careful; give great charge
==20==Our diet be made dainty for the taste;
==21==For, of all people that the earth affords,
==22==The Londoners fare richest at their boards.

*Exeunt.*
