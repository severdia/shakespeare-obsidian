## Act 5, Scene 6
[[Act 5, Scene 5|← Act 5, Scene 5]]

*Antium. A public place.*

*Enter Tullus Aufidius with Attendants.*

**AUF.**
==1==Go tell the lords a’ th’ city I am here.
==2==Deliver them this paper. Having read it,
==3==Bid them repair to th’ market-place, where I,
==4==Even in theirs and in the commons’ ears,
==5==Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
==6==The city ports by this hath enter’d, and
==7==Intends t’ appear before the people, hoping
==8==To purge himself with words. Dispatch.
*(Exeunt Attendants.)*
*(Enter three or four Conspirators of Aufidius’ faction.)*
==8==                     Most welcome!

**1. CONSP.**
==9==How is it with our general?

**AUF.**
==9==                Even so
==10==As with a man by his own alms empoison’d,
==11==And with his charity slain.

**2. CONSP.**
==11==              Most noble sir,
==12==If you do hold the same intent wherein
==13==You wish’d us parties, we’ll deliver you
==14==Of your great danger.

**AUF.**
==14==           Sir, I cannot tell,
==15==We must proceed as we do find the people.

**3. CONSP.**
==16==The people will remain uncertain whilst
==17==’Twixt you there’s difference; but the fall of either
==18==Makes the survivor heir of all.

**AUF.**
==18==                  I know it;
==19==And my pretext to strike at him admits
==20==A good construction. I rais’d him, and I pawn’d
==21==Mine honor for his truth; who being so heighten’d,
==22==He watered his new plants with dews of flattery,
==23==Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
==24==He bow’d his nature, never known before
==25==But to be rough, unswayable, and free.

**3. CONSP.**
==26==Sir, his stoutness
==27==When he did stand for consul, which he lost
==28==By lack of stooping⁠—

**AUF.**
==28==           That I would have spoke of:
==29==Being banish’d for’t, he came unto my hearth,
==30==Presented to my knife his throat. I took him;
==31==Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
==32==In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
==33==Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
==34==My best and freshest men; serv’d his designments
==35==In mine own person; help to reap the fame
==36==Which he did end all his, and took some pride
==37==To do myself this wrong; till at the last
==38==I seem’d his follower, not partner, and
==39==He wag’d me with his countenance as if
==40==I had been mercenary.

**1. CONSP.**
==40==              So he did, my lord.
==41==The army marvell’d at it, and in the last,
==42==When he had carried Rome and that we look’d
==43==For no less spoil than glory⁠—

**AUF.**
==43==                There was it;
==44==For which my sinews shall be stretch’d upon him:
==45==At a few drops of women’s rheum, which are
==46==As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labor
==47==Of our great action; therefore shall he die,
==48==And I’ll renew me in his fall. But hark!

*Drums and trumpets sounds, with great shouts of the people.*

**1. CONSP.**
==49==Your native town you enter’d like a post,
==50==And had no welcomes home, but he returns
==51==Splitting the air with noise.

**2. CONSP.**
==51==                And patient fools,
==52==Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
==53==With giving him glory.

**3. CONSP.**
==53==              Therefore at your vantage,
==54==Ere he express himself or move the people
==55==With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
==56==Which we will second. When he lies along,
==57==After your way his tale pronounc’d shall bury
==58==His reasons with his body.

**AUF.**
==58==              Say no more.
==59==Here come the lords.

*Enter the Volscian Lords.*

**ALL VOL. LORDS.**
==60==You are most welcome home.

**AUF.**
==60==                I have not deserv’d it.
==61==But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
==62==What I have written to you?

**ALL VOL. LORDS.**
==62==              We have.

**1. VOL. LORD.**
==62==                     And grieve to hear’t.
==63==What faults he made before the last, I think
==64==Might have found easy fines; but there to end
==65==Where he was to begin, and give away
==66==The benefit of our levies, answering us
==67==With our own charge, making a treaty where
==68==There was a yielding—this admits no excuse.

**AUF.**
==69==He approaches, you shall hear him.

*Enter Coriolanus marching with Drum and Colors, the Commoners being with him.*

**COR.**
==70==Hail, lords! I am return’d your soldier;
==71==No more infected with my country’s love
==72==Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
==73==Under your great command. You are to know
==74==That prosperously I have attempted, and
==75==With bloody passage led your wars even to
==76==The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
==77==Doth more than counterpoise a full third part
==78==The charges of the action. We have made peace
==79==With no less honor to the Antiates
==80==Than shame to th’ Romans; and we here deliver,
==81==Subscrib’d by th’ consuls and patricians,
==82==Together with the seal a’ th’ Senate, what
==83==We have compounded on.

**AUF.**
==83==              Read it not, noble lords,
==84==But tell the traitor, in the highest degree
==85==He hath abus’d your powers.

**COR.**
==86==“Traitor”? How now?

**AUF.**
==86==           Ay, traitor, Martius!

**COR.**
==86==                       “Martius”?

**AUF.**
==87==Ay, Martius, Caius Martius! Dost thou think
==88==I’ll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol’n name
==89==Coriolanus, in Corioles?
==90==You lords and heads a’ th’ state, perfidiously
==91==He has betray’d your business, and given up,
==92==For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
==93==I say “your city,” to his wife and mother,
==94==Breaking his oath and resolution like
==95==A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
==96==Counsel a’ th’ war; but at his nurse’s tears
==97==He whin’d and roar’d away your victory,
==98==That pages blush’d at him, and men of heart
==99==Look’d wond’ring each at others.

**COR.**
==99==                  Hear’st thou, Mars?

**AUF.**
==100==Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

**COR.**
==100==                     Ha?

**AUF.**
==101==No more.

**COR.**
==102==Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
==103==Too great for what contains it. “Boy”? O slave!
==104==Pardon me, lords, ’tis the first time that ever
==105==I was forc’d to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
==106==Must give this cur the lie; and his own notion⁠—
==107==Who wears my stripes impress’d upon him, that
==108==Must bear my beating to his grave—shall join
==109==To thrust the lie unto him.

**1. VOL. LORD.**
==110==Peace both, and hear me speak.

**COR.**
==111==Cut me to pieces, Volsces, men and lads,
==112==Stain all your edges on me. “Boy,” false hound!
==113==If you have writ your annals true, ’tis there
==114==That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
==115==Flutter’d your Volscians in Corioles.
==116==Alone I did it. “Boy”!

**AUF.**
==116==           Why, noble lords,
==117==Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
==118==Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
==119==’Fore your own eyes and ears?

**ALL CONSP.**
==119==                Let him die for’t.

**ALL VOL. LORDS.**
==120==Tear him to pieces! Do it presently!—He kill’d my son!—My daughter!—He kill’d my cousin Marcus!—He kill’d my father!

**2. VOL. LORD.**
==121==Peace ho! No outrage, peace!
==122==The man is noble, and his fame folds in
==123==This orb o’ th’ earth. His last offenses to us
==124==Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
==125==And trouble not the peace.

**COR.**
==125==              O that I had him,
==126==With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
==127==To use my lawful sword!

**AUF.**
==127==              Insolent villain!

**ALL CONSP.**
==128==Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

*Draw the Conspirators, and kills Martius, who falls; Aufidius stands on him.*

**ALL VOL. LORDS.**
==128==                Hold, hold, hold, hold!

**AUF.**
==129==My noble masters, hear me speak.

**1. VOL. LORD.**
==129==                  O Tullus!

**2. VOL. LORD.**
==130==Thou hast done a deed whereat valor will weep.

**3. VOL. LORD.**
==131==Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet,
==132==Put up your swords.

**AUF.**
==133==My lords, when you shall know (as in this rage,
==134==Provok’d by him, you cannot) the great danger
==135==Which this man’s life did owe you, you’ll rejoice
==136==That he is thus cut off. Please it your honors
==137==To call me to your Senate, I’ll deliver
==138==Myself your loyal servant, or endure
==139==Your heaviest censure.

**1. VOL. LORD.**
==139==              Bear from hence his body,
==140==And mourn you for him. Let him be regarded
==141==As the most noble corse that ever herald
==142==Did follow to his urn.

**2. VOL. LORD.**
==142==           His own impatience
==143==Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
==144==Let’s make the best of it.

**AUF.**
==144==              My rage is gone,
==145==And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
==146==Help, three a’ th’ chiefest soldiers; I’ll be one.
==147==Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully;
==148==Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
==149==Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,
==150==Which to this hour bewail the injury,
==151==Yet he shall have a noble memory.
==152==Assist.

*Exeunt, bearing the body of Martius. A dead march sounded.*
