## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Antium. Before Aufidius’ house.*

*Enter Coriolanus in mean apparel, disguis’d and muffled.*

**COR.**
==1==A goodly city is this Antium. City,
==2==’Tis I that made thy widows; many an heir
==3==Of these fair edifices ’fore my wars
==4==Have I heard groan and drop. Then know me not,
==5==Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
==6==In puny battle slay me.
*(Enter a Citizen of Antium.)*
==6==              ’Save you, sir.

**CIT. ANT.**
==7==And you.

**COR.**
==7==    Direct me, if it be your will,
==8==Where great Aufidius lies. Is he in Antium?

**CIT. ANT.**
==9==He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
==10==At his house this night.

**COR.**
==10==           Which is his house, beseech you?

**CIT. ANT.**
==11==This here before you.

**COR.**
==11==           Thank you, sir, farewell.
*(Exit Citizen of Antium.)*
==12==O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
==13==Whose double bosoms seems to wear one heart,
==14==Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal and exercise
==15==Are still together, who twin, as ’twere, in love
==16==Unseparable, shall within this hour,
==17==On a dissension of a doit, break out
==18==To bitterest enmity; so, fellest foes,
==19==Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep
==20==To take the one the other, by some chance,
==21==Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
==22==And interjoin their issues. So with me,
==23==My birthplace hate I, and my love’s upon
==24==This enemy town. I’ll enter. If he slay me,
==25==He does fair justice; if he give me way,
==26==I’ll do his country service.

*Exit.*
