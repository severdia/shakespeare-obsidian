## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 10|← Act 1, Scene 10]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. A public place.*

*Enter Menenius with the two tribunes of the people, Sicinius and Brutus.*

**MEN.**
The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight.

**BRU.**
Good or bad?

**MEN.**
Not according to the prayer of the people, for they love not Martius.

**SIC.**
Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

**MEN.**
Pray you, who does the wolf love?

**SIC.**
The lamb.

**MEN.**
Ay, to devour him, as the hungry plebeians would the noble Martius.

**BRU.**
He’s a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

**MEN.**
He’s a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

**BOTH MEN. AND BRU.**
Well, sir.

**MEN.**
In what enormity is Martius poor in, that you two have not in abundance?

**BRU.**
He’s poor in no one fault, but stor’d with all.

**SIC.**
Especially in pride.

**BRU.**
And topping all others in boasting.

**MEN.**
This is strange now. Do you two know how you are censur’d here in the city, I mean of us a’ th’ right-hand file? Do you?

**BOTH MEN. AND BRU.**
Why? How are we censur’d?

**MEN.**
Because you talk of pride now—will you not be angry?

**BOTH MEN. AND BRU.**
Well, well, sir, well.

**MEN.**
Why, ’tis no great matter; for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience. Give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures; at the least, if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so. You blame Martius for being proud?

**BRU.**
We do it not alone, sir.

**MEN.**
I know you can do very little alone, for your helps are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous single; your abilities are too infant-like for doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves! O that you could!

**BOTH MEN. AND BRU.**
What then, sir?

**MEN.**
Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, proud, violent, testy magistrates (alias fools) as any in Rome.

**SIC.**
Menenius, you are known well enough too.

**MEN.**
I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in’t; said to be something imperfect in favoring the first complaint, hasty and tinder-like upon too trivial motion; one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning. What I think, I utter, and spend my malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as you are (I cannot call you Lycurguses), if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a crooked face at it. I cannot say your worships have deliver’d the matter well, when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables; and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that tell you have good faces. If you see this in the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known well enough too? What harm can your beesom conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be known well enough too?

**BRU.**
Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

**MEN.**
You know neither me, yourselves, nor any thing. You are ambitious for poor knaves’ caps and legs. You wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange-wife and a forset-seller, and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience. When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinch’d with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.

**BRU.**
Come, come, you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol.

**MEN.**
Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the wagging of your beards, and your beards deserve not so honorable a grave as to stuff a botcher’s cushion, or to be entomb’d in an ass’s pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying Martius is proud; who, in a cheap estimation, is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the best of ’em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to your worships; more of your conversation would infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians. I will be bold to take my leave of you.
*(Brutus and Sicinius go aside.)*
*(Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Valeria.)*
How now, my as fair as noble ladies—and the moon, were she earthly, no nobler—whither do you follow your eyes so fast?

**VOL.**
Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius approaches. For the love of Juno, let’s go.

**MEN.**
Ha? Martius coming home?

**VOL.**
Ay, worthy Menenius, and with most prosperous approbation.

**MEN.**
Take my cap, Jupiter,
*(Tosses it up)*
and I thank thee. Hoo! Martius coming home?

**BOTH VIR. AND VAL.**
Nay, ’tis true.

**VOL.**
Look, here’s a letter from him; the state hath another, his wife another, and, I think, there’s one at home for you.

**MEN.**
I will make my very house reel tonight. A letter for me?

**VIR.**
Yes certain, there’s a letter for you, I saw’t.

**MEN.**
A letter for me! It gives me an estate of seven years’ health, in which time I will make a lip at the physician. The most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative, of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he not wounded? He was wont to come home wounded.

**VIR.**
O no, no, no.

**VOL.**
O, he is wounded, I thank the gods for’t.

**MEN.**
So do I too, if it be not too much. Brings ’a victory in his pocket? The wounds become him.

**VOL.**
On ’s brows. Menenius, he comes the third time home with the oaken garland.

**MEN.**
Has he disciplin’d Aufidius soundly?

**VOL.**
Titus Lartius writes they fought together, but Aufidius got off.

**MEN.**
And ’twas time for him too, I’ll warrant him that; and he had stay’d by him, I would not have been so fidius’d for all the chests in Corioles, and the gold that’s in them. Is the Senate possess’d of this?

**VOL.**
Good ladies, let’s go.—Yes, yes, yes; the Senate has letters from the general, wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war. He hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly.

**VAL.**
In troth, there’s wondrous things spoke of him.

**MEN.**
Wondrous! Ay, I warrant you, and not without his true purchasing.

**VIR.**
The gods grant them true!

**VOL.**
True? Pow, waw.

**MEN.**
True? I’ll be sworn they are true. Where is he wounded?
*(To the Tribunes.)*
God save your good worships! Martius is coming home; he has more cause to be proud.—Where is he wounded?

**VOL.**
I’ th’ shoulder and i’ th’ left arm. There will be large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall stand for his place. He receiv’d in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i’ th’ body.

**MEN.**
One i’ th’ neck, and two i’ th’ thigh—there’s nine that I know.

**VOL.**
He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five wounds upon him.

**MEN.**
Now it’s twenty-seven; every gash was an enemy’s grave.
*(A shout and flourish.)*
Hark, the trumpets.

**VOL.**
These are the ushers of Martius: before him he carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
Death, that dark spirit, in ’s nervy arm doth lie,
Which, being advanc’d, declines, and then men die.

*A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter Cominius the General, and Titus Lartius; between them, Coriolanus, crown’d with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers and a Roman Herald.*

**ROM. HER.**
Know, Rome, that all alone Martius did fight
Within Corioles gates; where he hath won,
With fame, a name to Martius Caius; these
In honor follows Coriolanus.
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

*Sound. Flourish.*

**ALL.**
Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

**COR.**
No more of this, it does offend my heart;
Pray now, no more.

**COM.**
           Look, sir, your mother!

**COR.**
                         O!
You have, I know, petition’d all the gods
For my prosperity!

*Kneels.*

**VOL.**
           Nay, my good soldier, up;
My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and
By deed-achieving honor newly nam’d⁠—
What is it?—Coriolanus must I call thee?⁠—
But O, thy wife!

**COR.**
           My gracious silence, hail!
Wouldst thou have laugh’d had I come coffin’d home,
That weep’st to see me triumph? Ah, my dear,
Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear,
And mothers that lack sons.

**MEN.**
              Now the gods crown thee!

**COR.**
And live you yet?
*(To Valeria.)*
           O my sweet lady, pardon.

**VOL.**
I know not where to turn. O, welcome home;
And welcome, general, and y’ are welcome all.

**MEN.**
A hundred thousand welcomes! I could weep,
And I could laugh; I am light, and heavy. Welcome!
A curse begin at very root on ’s heart,
That is not glad to see thee! You are three
That Rome should dote on; yet, by the faith of men,
We have some old crab-trees here at home that will not
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors;
We call a nettle but a nettle, and
The faults of fools but folly.

**COM.**
                Ever right.

**COR.**
Menenius, ever, ever.

**ROM. HER.**
Give way there, and go on!

**COR.**
*(To Volumnia and Virgilia.)*
Your hand, and yours!
Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
The good patricians must be visited,
From whom I have receiv’d not only greetings,
But with them change of honors.

**VOL.**
                  I have lived
To see inherited my very wishes
And the buildings of my fancy; only
There’s one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
Our Rome will cast upon thee.

**COR.**
                Know, good mother,
I had rather be their servant in my way
Than sway with them in theirs.

**COM.**
                  On, to the Capitol!

*Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before.*

*Brutus and Sicinius come forward.*

**BRU.**
All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
Are spectacled to see him. Your prattling nurse
Into a rapture lets her baby cry
While she chats him; the kitchen malkin pins
Her richest lockram ’bout her reechy neck,
Clamb’ring the walls to eye him; stalls, bulks, windows
Are smother’d up, leads fill’d, and ridges hors’d
With variable complexions, all agreeing
In earnestness to see him. Seld-shown flamens
Do press among the popular throngs, and puff
To win a vulgar station; our veil’d dames
Commit the war of white and damask in
Their nicely gawded cheeks to th’ wanton spoil
Of Phoebus’ burning kisses—such a pother
As if that whatsoever god who leads him
Were slyly crept into his human powers,
And gave him graceful posture.

**SIC.**
                  On the sudden,
I warrant him consul.

**BRU.**
           Then our office may,
During his power, go sleep.

**SIC.**
He cannot temp’rately transport his honors
From where he should begin and end, but will
Lose those he hath won.

**BRU.**
              In that there’s comfort.

**SIC.**
                       Doubt not
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
Upon their ancient malice will forget
With the least cause these his new honors, which
That he will give them make I as little question
As he is proud to do’t.

**BRU.**
              I heard him swear,
Were he to stand for consul, never would he
Appear i’ th’ market-place, nor on him put
The napless vesture of humility,
Nor, showing (as the manner is) his wounds
To th’ people, beg their stinking breaths.

**SIC.**
                     ’Tis right.

**BRU.**
It was his word. O, he would miss it rather
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
And the desire of the nobles.

**SIC.**
                I wish no better
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
In execution.

**BRU.**
        ’Tis most like he will.

**SIC.**
It shall be to him then as our good wills:
A sure destruction.

**BRU.**
           So it must fall out
To him, or our authorities, for an end.
We must suggest the people in what hatred
He still hath held them; that to ’s power he would
Have made them mules, silenc’d their pleaders, and
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
In human action and capacity,
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
Than camels in their war, who have their provand
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
For sinking under them.

**SIC.**
           This, as you say, suggested
At some time when his soaring insolence
Shall teach the people—which time shall not want,
If he be put upon’t, and that’s as easy
As to set dogs on sheep—will be his fire
To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
Shall darken him forever.

*Enter Third Messenger.*

**BRU.**
              What’s the matter?

**3. MESS.**
You are sent for to the Capitol. ’Tis thought
That Martius shall be consul.
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him, and
The blind to hear him speak. Matrons flung gloves,
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
Upon him as he pass’d; the nobles bended,
As to Jove’s statue, and the commons made
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
I never saw the like.

**BRU.**
           Let’s to the Capitol,
And carry with us ears and eyes for th’ time,
But hearts for the event.

**SIC.**
              Have with you.

*Exeunt.*
