## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. Before a gate of the city.*

*Enter Coriolanus, Volumnia, Virgilia, Menenius, Cominius, with the young Nobility of Rome.*

**COR.**
==1== Come leave your tears: a brief farewell. The beast
==2== With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
==3== Where is your ancient courage? You were us’d
==4== To say extremities was the trier of spirits,
==5== That common chances common men could bear,
==6== That when the sea was calm all boats alike
==7== Show’d mastership in floating; fortune’s blows
==8== When most struck home, being gentle wounded craves
==9== A noble cunning. You were us’d to load me
==10== With precepts that would make invincible
==11== The heart that conn’d them.

**VIR.**
==12== O heavens! O heavens!

**COR.**
==12==               Nay, I prithee, woman⁠—

**VOL.**
==13== Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
==14== And occupations perish!

**COR.**
==14==               What, what, what!
==15== I shall be lov’d when I am lack’d. Nay, mother,
==16== Resume that spirit when you were wont to say,
==17== If you had been the wife of Hercules,
==18== Six of his labors you’ld have done, and sav’d
==19== Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
==20== Droop not, *adieu*. Farewell, my wife, my mother,
==21== I’ll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
==22== Thy tears are salter than a younger man’s,
==23== And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
==24== I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld
==25== Heart-hard’ning spectacles; tell these sad women
==26== ’Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
==27== As ’tis to laugh at ’em. My mother, you wot well
==28== My hazards still have been your solace, and
==29== Believe’t not lightly—though I go alone,
==30== Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
==31== Makes fear’d and talk’d of more than seen—your son
==32== Will or exceed the common or be caught
==33== With cautelous baits and practice.

**VOL.**
==33==                   My first son,
==34== Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
==35== With thee a while. Determine on some course
==36== More than a wild exposture to each chance
==37== That starts i’ th’ way before thee.

**COR.**
==37==                   O the gods!

**COM.**
==38== I’ll follow thee a month, devise with thee
==39== Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
==40== And we of thee; so if the time thrust forth
==41== A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
==42== O’er the vast world to seek a single man,
==43== And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
==44== I’ th’ absence of the needer.

**COR.**
==44==                 Fare ye well!
==45== Thou hast years upon thee, and thou art too full
==46== Of the wars’ surfeits to go rove with one
==47== That’s yet unbruis’d. Bring me but out at gate.
==48== Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
==49== My friends of noble touch; when I am forth,
==50== Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you come.
==51== While I remain above the ground, you shall
==52== Hear from me still, and never of me aught
==53== But what is like me formerly.

**MEN.**
==53==                 That’s worthily
==54== As any ear can hear. Come, let’s not weep.
==55== If I could shake off but one seven years
==56== From these old arms and legs, by the good gods
==57== I’ld with thee every foot.

**COR.**
==57==               Give me thy hand.
==58== Come.

*Exeunt.*
