## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 6|Act 5, Scene 6 →]]

*Rome. A street near the city gate.*

*Enter two Senators with Ladies (Volumnia, Virgilia, Valeria), passing over the stage, with other Lords.*

**2. ROM. SEN.**
Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
And make triumphant fires! Strew flowers before them!
Unshout the noise that banish’d Martius!
Repeal him with the welcome of his mother.
Cry, “Welcome, ladies, welcome!”

**LORDS AND SENATORS.**
                  Welcome, ladies,
Welcome!

*A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt.*
