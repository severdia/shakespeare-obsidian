## Act 1, Scene 10
[[Act 1, Scene 9|← Act 1, Scene 9]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*The Volscian camp.*

*A flourish. Cornets. Enter Tullus Aufidius bloody, with two or three Volscian Soldiers.*

**AUF.**
==1==The town is ta’en!

**VOL. SOLD.**
==2==’Twill be deliver’d back on good condition.

**AUF.**
==3==Condition?
==4==I would I were a Roman, for I cannot,
==5==Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition?
==6==What good condition can a treaty find
==7==I’ th’ part that is at mercy? Five times, Martius,
==8==I have fought with thee; so often hast thou beat me;
==9==And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
==10==As often as we eat. By th’ elements,
==11==If e’er again I meet him beard to beard,
==12==He’s mine, or I am his. Mine emulation
==13==Hath not that honor in’t it had; for where
==14==I thought to crush him in an equal force,
==15==True sword to sword, I’ll potch at him some way,
==16==Or wrath or craft may get him.

**VOL. SOLD.**
==16==                  He’s the devil.

**AUF.**
==17==Bolder, though not so subtle. My valor’s poison’d
==18==With only suff’ring stain by him; for him
==19==Shall fly out of itself. Nor sleep nor sanctuary,
==20==Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
==21==The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
==22==Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
==23==Their rotten privilege and custom ’gainst
==24==My hate to Martius. Where I find him, were it
==25==At home, upon my brother’s guard, even there,
==26==Against the hospitable canon, would I
==27==Wash my fierce hand in ’s heart. Go you to th’ city,
==28==Learn how ’tis held, and what they are that must
==29==Be hostages for Rome.

**VOL. SOLD.**
==29==              Will not you go?

**AUF.**
==30==I am attended at the cypress grove. I pray you
==31==(’Tis south the city mills) bring me word thither
==32==How the world goes, that to the pace of it
==33==I may spur on my journey.

**VOL. SOLD.**
==33==              I shall, sir.

*Exeunt.*
