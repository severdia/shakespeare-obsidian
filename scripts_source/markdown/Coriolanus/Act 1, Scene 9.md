## Act 1, Scene 9
[[Act 1, Scene 8|← Act 1, Scene 8]] | [[Act 1, Scene 10|Act 1, Scene 10 →]]

*The Roman camp.*

*Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Enter, at one door, Cominius, with the Roman Soldiers; at another door, Martius with his arm in a scarf.*

**COM.**
==1==If I should tell thee o’er this thy day’s work,
==2==Thou’t not believe thy deeds: but I’ll report it
==3==Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles;
==4==Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
==5==I’ th’ end admire; where ladies shall be frighted,
==6==And gladly quak’d, hear more; where the dull tribunes,
==7==That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honors,
==8==Shall say against their hearts, “We thank the gods
==9==Our Rome hath such a soldier.”
==10==Yet cam’st thou to a morsel of this feast,
==11==Having fully din’d before.

*Enter Titus Lartius with his power, from the pursuit.*

**LART.**
==11==              O general!
==12==Here is the steed, we the caparison.
==13==Hadst thou beheld⁠—

**MAR.**
==13==           Pray now, no more. My mother,
==14==Who has a charter to extol her blood,
==15==When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
==16==As you have done—that’s what I can; induc’d
==17==As you have been—that’s for my country:
==18==He that has but effected his good will
==19==Hath overta’en mine act.

**COM.**
==19==              You shall not be
==20==The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
==21==The value of her own. ’Twere a concealment
==22==Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
==23==To hide your doings, and to silence that
==24==Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch’d,
==25==Would seem but modest; therefore I beseech you,
==26==In sign of what you are, not to reward
==27==What you have done, before our army hear me.

**MAR.**
==28==I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
==29==To hear themselves rememb’red.

**COM.**
==29==                  Should they not,
==30==Well might they fester ’gainst ingratitude,
==31==And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses⁠—
==32==Whereof we have ta’en good and good store—of all
==33==The treasure in this field achiev’d and city,
==34==We render you the tenth, to be ta’en forth,
==35==Before the common distribution, at
==36==Your only choice.

**MAR.**
==36==           I thank you, general;
==37==But cannot make my heart consent to take
==38==A bribe to pay my sword. I do refuse it,
==39==And stand upon my common part with those
==40==That have beheld the doing.
*(A long flourish. They all cry, “Martius! Martius!”, cast up their caps and lances. Cominius and Lartius stand bare.)*
==41==May these same instruments, which you profane,
==42==Never sound more! When drums and trumpets shall
==43==I’ th’ field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
==44==Made all of false-fac’d soothing!
==45==When steel grows soft as the parasite’s silk,
==46==Let him be made an overture for th’ wars!
==47==No more, I say! For that I have not wash’d
==48==My nose that bled, or foil’d some debile wretch⁠—
==49==Which, without note, here’s many else have done⁠—
==50==You shout me forth
==51==In acclamations hyperbolical,
==52==As if I lov’d my little should be dieted
==53==In praises sauc’d with lies.

**COM.**
==53==              Too modest are you;
==54==More cruel to your good report than grateful
==55==To us that give you truly. By your patience,
==56==If ’gainst yourself you be incens’d, we’ll put you
==57==(Like one that means his proper harm) in manacles,
==58==Then reason safely with you. Therefore be it known,
==59==As to us, to all the world, that Caius Martius
==60==Wears this war’s garland; in token of the which,
==61==My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
==62==With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
==63==For what he did before Corioles, call him,
==64==With all th’ applause and clamor of the host,
==65==Martius Caius Coriolanus! Bear
==66==Th’ addition nobly ever!

*Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums.*

**ALL.**
==67==Martius Caius Coriolanus!

**COR.**
==68==I will go wash;
==69==And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
==70==Whether I blush or no; howbeit, I thank you.
==71==I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
==72==To undercrest your good addition
==73==To th’ fairness of my power.

**COM.**
==73==                So, to our tent;
==74==Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
==75==To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
==76==Must to Corioles back. Send us to Rome
==77==The best, with whom we may articulate
==78==For their own good and ours.

**LART.**
==78==                I shall, my lord.

**COR.**
==79==The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
==80==Refus’d most princely gifts, am bound to beg
==81==Of my lord general.

**COM.**
==81==           Take’t, ’tis yours. What is’t?

**COR.**
==82==I sometime lay here in Corioles
==83==At a poor man’s house; he us’d me kindly.
==84==He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
==85==But then Aufidius was within my view,
==86==And wrath o’erwhelm’d my pity. I request you
==87==To give my poor host freedom.

**COM.**
==87==                  O, well begg’d!
==88==Were he the butcher of my son, he should
==89==Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

**LART.**
==90==Martius, his name?

**COR.**
==90==           By Jupiter, forgot!
==91==I am weary, yea, my memory is tir’d.
==92==Have we no wine here?

**COM.**
==92==              Go we to our tent.
==93==The blood upon your visage dries, ’tis time
==94==It should be look’d to. Come.

*Exeunt.*
