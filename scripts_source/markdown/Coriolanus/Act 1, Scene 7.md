## Act 1, Scene 7
[[Act 1, Scene 6|← Act 1, Scene 6]] | [[Act 1, Scene 8|Act 1, Scene 8 →]]

*The gates of Corioli.*

*Titus Lartius, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with Drum and Trumpet toward Cominius and Caius Martius, enters with a Lieutenant, other Roman Soldiers, and a Scout.*

**LART.**
==1== So, let the ports be guarded; keep your duties,
==2== As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
==3== Those centuries to our aid; the rest will serve
==4== For a short holding. If we lose the field,
==5== We cannot keep the town.

**LIEU. LART.**
==5==               Fear not our care, sir.

**LART.**
==6== Hence; and shut your gates upon ’s.
==7== Our guider, come, to th’ Roman camp conduct us.

*Exeunt.*
