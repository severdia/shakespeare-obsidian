## Act 1, Scene 8
[[Act 1, Scene 7|← Act 1, Scene 7]] | [[Act 1, Scene 9|Act 1, Scene 9 →]]

*A field of battle.*

*Alarum as in battle. Enter Martius and Aufidius at several doors.*

**MAR.**
==1==I’ll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
==2==Worse than a promise-breaker.

**AUF.**
==2==                We hate alike:
==3==Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
==4==More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

**MAR.**
==5==Let the first budger die the other’s slave,
==6==And the gods doom him after!

**AUF.**
==6==                If I fly, Martius,
==7==Hollow me like a hare.

**MAR.**
==8==Within these three hours, Tullus,
==9==Alone I fought in your Corioles walls,
==10==And made what work I pleas’d. ’Tis not my blood
==11==Wherein thou seest me mask’d; for thy revenge
==12==Wrench up thy power to th’ highest.

**AUF.**
==12==                  Wert thou the Hector
==13==That was the whip of your bragg’d progeny
==14==Thou shouldst not scape me here.
*(Here they fight, and certain Volscian Soldiers come in the aid of Aufidius. Martius fights till they be driven in breathless.)*
==15==Officious, and not valiant, you have sham’d me
==16==In your condemned seconds.

*Exeunt.*
