## Act 1, Scene 8
[[Act 1, Scene 7|← Act 1, Scene 7]] | [[Act 1, Scene 9|Act 1, Scene 9 →]]

*A field of battle.*

*Alarum as in battle. Enter Martius and Aufidius at several doors.*

**MAR.**
I’ll fight with none but thee, for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.

**AUF.**
                We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

**MAR.**
Let the first budger die the other’s slave,
And the gods doom him after!

**AUF.**
                If I fly, Martius,
Hollow me like a hare.

**MAR.**
Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioles walls,
And made what work I pleas’d. ’Tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask’d; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to th’ highest.

**AUF.**
                  Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg’d progeny
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
*(Here they fight, and certain Volscian Soldiers come in the aid of Aufidius. Martius fights till they be driven in breathless.)*
Officious, and not valiant, you have sham’d me
In your condemned seconds.

*Exeunt.*
