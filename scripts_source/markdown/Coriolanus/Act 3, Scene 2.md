## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Rome. A room in Martius Coriolanus’ house.*

*Enter Coriolanus with Patricians.*

**COR.**
==1==Let them pull all about mine ears, present me
==2==Death on the wheel, or at wild horses’ heels,
==3==Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
==4==That the precipitation might down stretch
==5==Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
==6==Be thus to them.

**PATRICIAN.**
==6==        You do the nobler.

**COR.**
==7==I muse my mother
==8==Does not approve me further, who was wont
==9==To call them woollen vassals, things created
==10==To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
==11==In congregations, to yawn, be still, and wonder,
==12==When one but of my ordinance stood up
==13==To speak of peace or war.
*(Enter Volumnia.)*
==13==                I talk of you:
==14==Why did you wish me milder? Would you have me
==15==False to my nature? Rather say, I play
==16==The man I am.

**VOL.**
==16==        O, sir, sir, sir,
==17==I would have had you put your power well on
==18==Before you had worn it out.

**COR.**
==18==                Let go.

**VOL.**
==19==You might have been enough the man you are,
==20==With striving less to be so. Lesser had been
==21==The thwartings of your dispositions, if
==22==You had not show’d them how ye were dispos’d
==23==Ere they lack’d power to cross you.

**COR.**
==23==                  Let them hang!

**VOL.**
==24==Ay, and burn too.

*Enter Menenius with the Roman Senators.*

**MEN.**
==25==Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough;
==26==You must return and mend it.

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==26==                There’s no remedy,
==27==Unless, by not so doing, our good city
==28==Cleave in the midst and perish.

**VOL.**
==28==                Pray be counsell’d.
==29==I have a heart as little apt as yours,
==30==But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
==31==To better vantage.

**MEN.**
==31==           Well said, noble woman!
==32==Before he should thus stoop to th’ herd, but that
==33==The violent fit a’ th’ time craves it as physic
==34==For the whole state, I would put mine armor on,
==35==Which I can scarcely bear.

**COR.**
==35==              What must I do?

**MEN.**
==36==Return to th’ tribunes.

**COR.**
==36==           Well, what then? What then?

**MEN.**
==37==Repent what you have spoke.

**COR.**
==38==For them? I cannot do it to the gods,
==39==Must I then do’t to them?

**VOL.**
==39==              You are too absolute,
==40==Though therein you can never be too noble,
==41==But when extremities speak. I have heard you say
==42==Honor and policy, like unsever’d friends,
==43==I’ th’ war do grow together; grant that, and tell me
==44==In peace what each of them by th’ other lose
==45==That they combine not there.

**COR.**
==45==                Tush, tush!

**MEN.**
==45==                     A good demand.

**VOL.**
==46==If it be honor in your wars to seem
==47==The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
==48==You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse
==49==That it shall hold companionship in peace
==50==With honor, as in war, since that to both
==51==It stands in like request?

**COR.**
==51==              Why force you this?

**VOL.**
==52==Because that now it lies you on to speak
==53==To th’ people; not by your own instruction,
==54==Nor by th’ matter which your heart prompts you,
==55==But with such words that are but roted in
==56==Your tongue, though but bastards, and syllables
==57==Of no allowance, to your bosom’s truth.
==58==Now, this no more dishonors you at all
==59==Than to take in a town with gentle words,
==60==Which else would put you to your fortune and
==61==The hazard of much blood.
==62==I would dissemble with my nature where
==63==My fortunes and my friends at stake requir’d
==64==I should do so in honor. I am in this
==65==Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
==66==And you will rather show our general louts
==67==How you can frown, than spend a fawn upon ’em
==68==For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
==69==Of what that want might ruin.

**MEN.**
==69==                  Noble lady!
==70==—Come go with us, speak fair. You may salve so,
==71==Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
==72==Of what is past.

**VOL.**
==72==           I prithee now, my son,
==73==Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand,
==74==And thus far having stretch’d it (here be with them),
==75==Thy knee bussing the stones (for in such business
==76==Action is eloquence, and the eyes of th’ ignorant
==77==More learned than the ears), waving thy head,
==78==Which often thus correcting thy stout heart,
==79==Now humble as the ripest mulberry
==80==That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
==81==Thou art their soldier, and, being bred in broils,
==82==Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
==83==Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
==84==In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
==85==Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
==86==As thou hast power and person.

**MEN.**
==86==                  This but done,
==87==Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
==88==For they have pardons, being ask’d, as free
==89==As words to little purpose.

**VOL.**
==89==              Prithee now,
==90==Go, and be rul’d; although I know thou hadst rather
==91==Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
==92==Than flatter him in a bower.
*(Enter Cominius.)*
==92==                Here is Cominius.

**COM.**
==93==I have been i’ th’ market-place; and, sir, ’tis fit
==94==You make strong party, or defend yourself
==95==By calmness or by absence. All’s in anger.

**MEN.**
==96==Only fair speech.

**COM.**
==96==           I think ’twill serve, if he
==97==Can thereto frame his spirit.

**VOL.**
==97==              He must, and will.
==98==Prithee now say you will, and go about it.

**COR.**
==99==Must I go show them my unbarb’d sconce? Must I
==100==With my base tongue give to my noble heart
==101==A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do’t;
==102==Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
==103==This mould of Martius, they to dust should grind it
==104==And throw’t against the wind. To th’ market-place!
==105==You have put me now to such a part which never
==106==I shall discharge to th’ life.

**COM.**
==106==              Come, come, we’ll prompt you.

**VOL.**
==107==I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
==108==My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
==109==To have my praise for this, perform a part
==110==Thou hast not done before.

**COR.**
==110==              Well, I must do’t.
==111==Away, my disposition, and possess me
==112==Some harlot’s spirit! My throat of war be turn’d,
==113==Which quier’d with my drum, into a pipe
==114==Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
==115==That babies lull asleep! The smiles of knaves
==116==Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys’ tears take up
==117==The glasses of my sight! A beggar’s tongue
==118==Make motion through my lips, and my arm’d knees,
==119==Who bow’d but in my stirrup, bend like his
==120==That hath receiv’d an alms! I will not do’t,
==121==Lest I surcease to honor mine own truth,
==122==And by my body’s action teach my mind
==123==A most inherent baseness.

**VOL.**
==123==              At thy choice then.
==124==To beg of thee, it is my more dishonor
==125==Than thou of them. Come all to ruin, let
==126==Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
==127==Thy dangerous stoutness; for I mock at death
==128==With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list;
==129==Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck’st it from me;
==130==But owe thy pride thyself.

**COR.**
==130==              Pray be content.
==131==Mother, I am going to the market-place;
==132==Chide me no more. I’ll mountebank their loves,
==133==Cog their hearts from them, and come home belov’d
==134==Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going.
==135==Commend me to my wife. I’ll return consul,
==136==Or never trust to what my tongue can do
==137==I’ th’ way of flattery further.

**VOL.**
==137==                Do your will.

*Exit Volumnia.*

**COM.**
==138==Away, the tribunes do attend you. Arm yourself
==139==To answer mildly; for they are prepar’d
==140==With accusations, as I hear, more strong
==141==Than are upon you yet.

**COR.**
==142==The word is “mildly.” Pray you let us go.
==143==Let them accuse me by invention; I
==144==Will answer in mine honor.

**MEN.**
==144==              Ay, but mildly.

**COR.**
==145==Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

*Exeunt.*
