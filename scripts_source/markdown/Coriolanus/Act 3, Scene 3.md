## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. The forum.*

*Enter Sicinius and Brutus.*

**BRU.**
==1==In this point charge him home, that he affects
==2==Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,
==3==Enforce him with his envy to the people,
==4==And that the spoil got on the Antiates
==5==Was ne’er distributed.
*(Enter First Aedile.)*
==5==           What, will he come?

**1. AED.**
==6==He’s coming.

**BRU.**
==6==        How accompanied?

**1. AED.**
==7==With old Menenius and those senators
==8==That always favor’d him.

**SIC.**
==8==              Have you a catalog
==9==Of all the voices that we have procur’d,
==10==Set down by th’ poll?

**1. AED.**
==10==           I have; ’tis ready.

**SIC.**
==11==Have you collected them by tribes?

**1. AED.**
==11==                     I have.

**SIC.**
==12==Assemble presently the people hither;
==13==And when they hear me say, “It shall be so
==14==I’ th’ right and strength a’ th’ commons,” be it either
==15==For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them,
==16==If I say fine, cry “Fine!”; if death, cry “Death!”;
==17==Insisting on the old prerogative
==18==And power i’ th’ truth a’ th’ cause.

**1. AED.**
==18==                  I shall inform them.

**BRU.**
==19==And when such time they have begun to cry,
==20==Let them not cease, but with a din confus’d
==21==Enforce the present execution
==22==Of what we chance to sentence.

**1. AED.**
==22==                  Very well.

**SIC.**
==23==Make them be strong, and ready for this hint
==24==When we shall hap to give’t them.

**BRU.**
==24==                  Go about it.
*(Exit First Aedile.)*
==25==Put him to choler straight, he hath been us’d
==26==Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
==27==Of contradiction. Being once chaf’d, he cannot
==28==Be rein’d again to temperance; then he speaks
==29==What’s in his heart, and that is there which looks
==30==With us to break his neck.

*Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, and Cominius, with others, Senators and Patricians.*

**SIC.**
==30==              Well, here he comes.

**MEN.**
==31==Calmly, I do beseech you.

**COR.**
==32==Ay, as an hostler, that for th’ poorest piece
==33==Will bear the knave by th’ volume. Th’ honor’d gods
==34==Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
==35==Supplied with worthy men! Plant love among ’s!
==36==Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
==37==And not our streets with war!

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==37==                Amen, amen.

**MEN.**
==38==A noble wish.

*Enter the First Aedile with the Plebeians.*

**SIC.**
==39==Draw near, ye people.

**1. AED.**
==40==List to your tribunes. Audience! Peace, I say!

**COR.**
==41==First hear me speak.

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==41==           Well, say. Peace ho!

**COR.**
==42==Shall I be charg’d no further than this present?
==43==Must all determine here?

**SIC.**
==43==              I do demand
==44==If you submit you to the people’s voices,
==45==Allow their officers, and are content
==46==To suffer lawful censure for such faults
==47==As shall be prov’d upon you.

**COR.**
==47==                I am content.

**MEN.**
==48==Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
==49==The warlike service he has done, consider; think
==50==Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
==51==Like graves i’ th’ holy churchyard.

**COR.**
==51==                  Scratches with briers,
==52==Scars to move laughter only.

**MEN.**
==52==                Consider further:
==53==That when he speaks not like a citizen,
==54==You find him like a soldier; do not take
==55==His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
==56==But as I say, such as become a soldier
==57==Rather than envy you.

**COM.**
==57==           Well, well, no more.

**COR.**
==58==What is the matter
==59==That being pass’d for consul with full voice,
==60==I am so dishonor’d that the very hour
==61==You take it off again?

**SIC.**
==61==           Answer to us.

**COR.**
==62==Say then; ’tis true, I ought so.

**SIC.**
==63==We charge you, that you have contriv’d to take
==64==From Rome all season’d office, and to wind
==65==Yourself into a power tyrannical,
==66==For which you are a traitor to the people.

**COR.**
==67==How? Traitor?

**MEN.**
==67==        Nay, temperately; your promise.

**COR.**
==68==The fires i’ th’ lowest hell fold in the people!
==69==Call me their traitor, thou injurious tribune!
==70==Within thine eyes sate twenty thousand deaths,
==71==In thy hands clutch’d as many millions, in
==72==Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
==73==“Thou liest” unto thee with a voice as free
==74==As I do pray the gods.

**SIC.**
==74==           Mark you this, people?

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==75==To th’ rock, to th’ rock with him!

**SIC.**
==75==                  Peace!
==76==We need not put new matter to his charge.
==77==What you have seen him do, and heard him speak,
==78==Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
==79==Opposing laws with strokes, and here defying
==80==Those whose great power must try him—even this
==81==So criminal, and in such capital kind,
==82==Deserves th’ extremest death.

**BRU.**
==82==                But since he hath
==83==Serv’d well for Rome⁠—

**COR.**
==83==           What do you prate of service?

**BRU.**
==84==I talk of that, that know it.

**COR.**
==85==You?

**MEN.**
==86==Is this the promise that you made your mother?

**COM.**
==87==Know, I pray you⁠—

**COR.**
==87==           I’ll know no further.
==88==Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
==89==Vagabond exile, fleaing, pent to linger
==90==But with a grain a day, I would not buy
==91==Their mercy at the price of one fair word,
==92==Nor check my courage for what they can give,
==93==To have’t with saying “Good morrow.”

**SIC.**
==93==                     For that he has
==94==(As much as in him lies) from time to time
==95==Envied against the people, seeking means
==96==To pluck away their power, as now at last
==97==Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
==98==Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
==99==That doth distribute it—in the name a’ th’ people,
==100==And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
==101==Even from this instant, banish him our city,
==102==In peril of precipitation
==103==From off the rock Tarpeian, never more
==104==To enter our Rome gates. I’ th’ people’s name,
==105==I say it shall be so.

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==106==It shall be so, it shall be so. Let him away!
==107==He’s banish’d, and it shall be so.

**COM.**
==108==Hear me, my masters, and my common friends⁠—

**SIC.**
==109==He’s sentenc’d; no more hearing.

**COM.**
==109==                  Let me speak.
==110==I have been consul, and can show for Rome
==111==Her enemies’ marks upon me. I do love
==112==My country’s good with a respect more tender,
==113==More holy and profound, than mine own life,
==114==My dear wive’s estimate, her womb’s increase
==115==And treasure of my loins; then if I would
==116==Speak that⁠—

**SIC.**
==116==        We know your drift. Speak what?

**BRU.**
==117==There’s no more to be said, but he is banish’d
==118==As enemy to the people and his country.
==119==It shall be so.

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==119==        It shall be so, it shall be so.

**COR.**
==120==You common cry of curs, whose breath I hate
==121==As reek a’ th’ rotten fens, whose loves I prize
==122==As the dead carcasses of unburied men
==123==That do corrupt my air—I banish you!
==124==And here remain with your uncertainty!
==125==Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts!
==126==Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
==127==Fan you into despair! Have the power still
==128==To banish your defenders, till at length
==129==Your ignorance (which finds not till it feels,
==130==Making but reservation of yourselves,
==131==Still your own foes) deliver you as most
==132==Abated captives to some nation
==133==That won you without blows! Despising,
==134==For you, the city, thus I turn my back;
==135==There is a world elsewhere.

*Exeunt Coriolanus, Cominius, cum aliis (Menenius, Senators, and Patricians).*

**1. AED.**
==136==The people’s enemy is gone, is gone!

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==137==Our enemy is banish’d, he is gone! Hoo! Hoo!

*They all shout and throw up their caps.*

**SIC.**
==138==Go see him out at gates, and follow him,
==139==As he hath follow’d you, with all despite;
==140==Give him deserv’d vexation. Let a guard
==141==Attend us through the city.

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==142==Come, come, let’s see him out at gates, come.
==143==The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

*Exeunt.*
