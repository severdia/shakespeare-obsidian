## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Rome. A room in Martius Coriolanus’ house.*

*Enter Volumnia and Virgilia, mother and wife to Martius; they set them down on two low stools and sew.*

**VOL.**
==1==I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb; when youth with comeliness pluck’d all gaze his way; when for a day of kings’ entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding; I, considering how honor would become such a person, that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th’ wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleas’d to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he return’d, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had prov’d himself a man.

**VIR.**
==2==But had he died in the business, madam, how then?

**VOL.**
==3==Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely; had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

*Enter a Gentlewoman.*

**GENTLEW.**
==4==Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

**VIR.**
==5==Beseech you give me leave to retire myself.

**VOL.**
==6==Indeed you shall not.
==7==Methinks I hear hither your husband’s drum;
==8==See him pluck Aufidius down by th’ hair;
==9==As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him.
==10==Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
==11==“Come on, you cowards, you were got in fear,
==12==Though you were born in Rome!” His bloody brow
==13==With his mail’d hand then wiping, forth he goes,
==14==Like to a harvest-man that’s task’d to mow
==15==Or all or lose his hire.

**VIR.**
==16==His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!

**VOL.**
==17==Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
==18==Than gilt his trophy. The breasts of Hecuba,
==19==When she did suckle Hector, look’d not lovelier
==20==Than Hector’s forehead when it spit forth blood
==21==At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria
==22==We are fit to bid her welcome.

*Exit Gentlewoman.*

**VIR.**
==23==Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

**VOL.**
==24==He’ll beat Aufidius’ head below his knee,
==25==And tread upon his neck.

*Enter Valeria with an Usher and a Gentlewoman.*

**VAL.**
==26==My ladies both, good day to you.

**VOL.**
==27==Sweet madam.

**VIR.**
==28==I am glad to see your ladyship.

**VAL.**
==29==How do you both? You are manifest house-keepers. What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good faith. How does your little son?

**VIR.**
==30==I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

**VOL.**
==31==He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster.

**VAL.**
==32==A’ my word, the father’s son. I’ll swear ’tis a very pretty boy. A’ my troth, I look’d upon him a’ We’n’sday half an hour together; h’as such a confirm’d countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again; catch’d it again: or whether his fallen rag’d him, or how ’twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it. O, I warrant, how he mammock’d it!

**VOL.**
==33==One on ’s father’s moods.

**VAL.**
==34==Indeed la, ’tis a noble child.

**VIR.**
==35==A crack, madam.

**VAL.**
==36==Come, lay aside your stitchery, I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon.

**VIR.**
==37==No, good madam, I will not out of doors.

**VAL.**
==38==Not out of doors?

**VOL.**
==39==She shall, she shall.

**VIR.**
==40==Indeed no, by your patience; I’ll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars.

**VAL.**
==41==Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably. Come, you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

**VIR.**
==42==I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with my prayers; but I cannot go thither.

**VOL.**
==43==Why, I pray you?

**VIR.**
==44==’Tis not to save labor, nor that I want love.

**VAL.**
==45==You would be another Penelope: yet they say, all the yarn she spun in Ulysses’ absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths. Come, I would your cambric were sensible as your finger, that you might leave pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

**VIR.**
==46==No, good madam, pardon me, indeed I will not forth.

**VAL.**
==47==In truth la, go with me, and I’ll tell you excellent news of your husband.

**VIR.**
==48==O, good madam, there can be none yet.

**VAL.**
==49==Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from him last night.

**VIR.**
==50==Indeed, madam?

**VAL.**
==51==In earnest, it’s true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioles; they nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honor, and so I pray go with us.

**VIR.**
==52==Give me excuse, good madam, I will obey you in every thing hereafter.

**VOL.**
==53==Let her alone, lady; as she is now, she will but disease our better mirth.

**VAL.**
==54==In troth, I think she would. Fare you well then. Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy solemnness out a’ door, and go along with us.

**VIR.**
==55==No, at a word, madam; indeed I must not.
==56==I wish you much mirth.

**VAL.**
==57==Well, then farewell.

*Exeunt Ladies with Usher.*
