## Act 4, Scene 7
[[Act 4, Scene 6|← Act 4, Scene 6]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*A camp near Rome.*

*Enter Aufidius with his Lieutenant.*

**AUF.**
==1==Do they still fly to th’ Roman?

**LIEU. AUF.**
==2==I do not know what witchcraft’s in him, but
==3==Your soldiers use him as the grace ’fore meat,
==4==Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
==5==And you are dark’ned in this action, sir,
==6==Even by your own.

**AUF.**
==6==           I cannot help it now,
==7==Unless by using means I lame the foot
==8==Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
==9==Even to my person, than I thought he would
==10==When first I did embrace him; yet his nature
==11==In that’s no changeling, and I must excuse
==12==What cannot be amended.

**LIEU. AUF.**
==12==              Yet I wish, sir
==13==(I mean for your particular), you had not
==14==Join’d in commission with him; but either
==15==Have borne the action of yourself, or else
==16==To him had left it solely.

**AUF.**
==17==I understand thee well, and be thou sure,
==18==When he shall come to his account, he knows not
==19==What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
==20==And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
==21==To th’ vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly,
==22==And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
==23==Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
==24==As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
==25==That which shall break his neck, or hazard mine,
==26==When e’er we come to our account.

**LIEU. AUF.**
==27==Sir, I beseech you, think you he’ll carry Rome?

**AUF.**
==28==All places yields to him ere he sits down,
==29==And the nobility of Rome are his.
==30==The senators and patricians love him too;
==31==The tribunes are no soldiers, and their people
==32==Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
==33==To expel him thence. I think he’ll be to Rome
==34==As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
==35==By sovereignty of nature. First he was
==36==A noble servant to them, but he could not
==37==Carry his honors even. Whether ’twas pride,
==38==Which out of daily fortune ever taints
==39==The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
==40==To fail in the disposing of those chances
==41==Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
==42==Not to be other than one thing, not moving
==43==From th’ casque to th’ cushion, but commanding peace
==44==Even with the same austerity and garb
==45==As he controll’d the war; but one of these
==46==(As he hath spices of them all, not all,
==47==For I dare so far free him) made him fear’d,
==48==So hated, and so banish’d; but he has a merit
==49==To choke it in the utt’rance. So our virtues
==50==Lie in th’ interpretation of the time,
==51==And power, unto itself most commendable,
==52==Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
==53==T’ extol what it hath done.
==54==One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
==55==Rights by rights fouler, strengths by strengths do fail.
==56==Come, let’s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
==57==Thou art poor’st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

*Exeunt.*
