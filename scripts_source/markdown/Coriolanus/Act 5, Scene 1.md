## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 7|← Act 4, Scene 7]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. A public place.*

*Enter Menenius, Cominius, Sicinius and Brutus, with others.*

**MEN.**
==1== No, I’ll not go. You hear what he hath said
==2== Which was sometime his general, who loved him
==3== In a most dear particular. He call’d me father;
==4== But what o’ that? Go you that banish’d him
==5== A mile before his tent, fall down, and knee
==6== The way into his mercy. Nay, if he coy’d
==7== To hear Cominius speak, I’ll keep at home.

**COM.**
==8== He would not seem to know me.

**MEN.**
==8==                   Do you hear?

**COM.**
==9== Yet one time he did call me by my name.
==10== I urg’d our old acquaintance, and the drops
==11== That we have bled together. Coriolanus
==12== He would not answer to; forbade all names;
==13== He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
==14== Till he had forg’d himself a name a’ th’ fire
==15== Of burning Rome.

**MEN.**
==15==         Why, so; you have made good work!
==16== A pair of tribunes that have wrack’d for Rome
==17== To make coals cheap! A noble memory!

**COM.**
==18== I minded him how royal ’twas to pardon
==19== When it was less expected. He replied,
==20== It was a bare petition of a state
==21== To one whom they had punish’d.

**MEN.**
==21==                   Very well.
==22== Could he say less?

**COM.**
==23== I offered to awaken his regard
==24== For ’s private friends. His answer to me was,
==25== He could not stay to pick them in a pile
==26== Of noisome musty chaff. He said ’twas folly,
==27== For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt
==28== And still to nose th’ offense.

**MEN.**
==28==                 For one poor grain or two?
==29== I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
==30== And this brave fellow too: we are the grains,
==31== You are the musty chaff, and you are smelt
==32== Above the moon. We must be burnt for you.

**SIC.**
==33== Nay, pray be patient. If you refuse your aid
==34== In this so never-needed help, yet do not
==35== Upbraid ’s with our distress. But sure if you
==36== Would be your country’s pleader, your good tongue,
==37== More than the instant army we can make,
==38== Might stop our countryman.

**MEN.**
==38==                 No; I’ll not meddle.

**SIC.**
==39== Pray you go to him.

**MEN.**
==39==            What should I do?

**BRU.**
==40== Only make trial what your love can do
==41== For Rome, towards Martius.

**MEN.**
==41==                 Well, and say that Martius
==42== Return me, as Cominius is return’d,
==43== Unheard—what then?
==44== But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
==45== With his unkindness? Say’t be so?

**SIC.**
==45==                   Yet your good will
==46== Must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
==47== As you intended well.

**MEN.**
==47==               I’ll undertake’t.
==48== I think he’ll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
==49== And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me.
==50== He was not taken well, he had not din’d:
==51== The veins unfill’d, our blood is cold, and then
==52== We pout upon the morning, are unapt
==53== To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff’d
==54== These pipes and these conveyances of our blood
==55== With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
==56== Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I’ll watch him
==57== Till he be dieted to my request,
==58== And then I’ll set upon him.

**BRU.**
==59== You know the very road into his kindness,
==60== And cannot lose your way.

**MEN.**
==60==               Good faith, I’ll prove him,
==61== Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
==62== Of my success.

*Exit.*

**COM.**
==62==         He’ll never hear him.

**SIC.**
==62==                      Not?

**COM.**
==63== I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
==64== Red as ’twould burn Rome; and his injury
==65== The jailer to his pity. I kneel’d before him;
==66== ’Twas very faintly he said, “Rise”; dismiss’d me
==67== Thus, with his speechless hand. What he would do
==68== He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
==69== Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions;
==70== So that all hope is vain,
==71== Unless his noble mother and his wife,
==72== Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
==73== For mercy to his country. Therefore let’s hence,
==74== And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

*Exeunt.*
