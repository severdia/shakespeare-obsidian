## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 1, Scene 6|Act 1, Scene 6 →]]

*Corioli. A street.*

*Enter certain Romans with spoils.*

**1. ROM.**
==1== This will I carry to Rome.

**2. ROM.**
==2== And I this.

**3. ROM.**
==3== A murrain on’t! I took this for silver.

*Exeunt.*

*Alarum continues still afar off.*

*Enter Martius and Titus Lartius with a Trumpet.*

**MAR.**
==4== See here these movers that do prize their hours
==5== At a crack’d drachme! Cushions, leaden spoons,
==6== Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
==7== Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
==8== Ere yet the fight be done, pack up. Down with them!
==9== And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
==10== There is the man of my soul’s hate, Aufidius,
==11== Piercing our Romans; then, valiant Titus, take
==12== Convenient numbers to make good the city,
==13== Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
==14== To help Cominius.

**LART.**
==14==            Worthy sir, thou bleed’st,
==15== Thy exercise hath been too violent for
==16== A second course of fight.

**MAR.**
==16==               Sir, praise me not;
==17== My work hath yet not warm’d me. Fare you well.
==18== The blood I drop is rather physical
==19== Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
==20== I will appear, and fight.

**LART.**
==20==            Now the fair goddess Fortune
==21== Fall deep in love with thee, and her great charms
==22== Misguide thy opposers’ swords! Bold gentleman!
==23== Prosperity be thy page.

**MAR.**
==23==               Thy friend no less
==24== Than those she placeth highest! So farewell.

**LART.**
==25== Thou worthiest Martius!
*(Exit Martius.)*
==26== Go sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
==27== Call thither all the officers a’ th’ town,
==28== Where they shall know our mind. Away!

*Exeunt.*
