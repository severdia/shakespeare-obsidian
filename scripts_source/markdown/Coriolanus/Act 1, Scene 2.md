## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Corioli. The Senate-house.*

*Enter Tullus Aufidius with Senators of Corioli.*

**1. VOL. SEN.**
==1== So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
==2== That they of Rome are ent’red in our counsels,
==3== And know how we proceed.

**AUF.**
==3==                 Is it not yours?
==4== What ever have been thought on in this state
==5== That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
==6== Had circumvention? ’Tis not four days gone
==7== Since I heard thence; these are the words—I think
==8== I have the letter here; yes, here it is:
*(Reads.)*
==9== *“They have press’d a power, but it is not known*
==10== *Whether for east or west. The dearth is great,*
==11== *The people mutinous; and it is rumor’d,*
==12== *Cominius, Martius your old enemy*
==13== *(Who is of Rome worse hated than of you),*
==14== *And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,*
==15== *These three lead on this preparation*
==16== *Whither ’tis bent. Most likely ’tis for you;*
==17== *Consider of it.”*

**1. VOL. SEN.**
==17==         Our army’s in the field.
==18== We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
==19== To answer us.

**AUF.**
==19==         Nor did you think it folly
==20== To keep your great pretenses veil’d till when
==21== They needs must show themselves, which in the hatching,
==22== It seem’d, appear’d to Rome. By the discovery
==23== We shall be shorten’d in our aim, which was
==24== To take in many towns ere (almost) Rome
==25== Should know we were afoot.

**2. VOL. SEN.**
==25==                 Noble Aufidius,
==26== Take your commission, hie you to your bands,
==27== Let us alone to guard Corioles.
==28== If they set down before ’s, for the remove
==29== Bring up your army; but, I think, you’ll find
==30== Th’ have not prepar’d for us.

**AUF.**
==30==                 O, doubt not that,
==31== I speak from certainties. Nay more,
==32== Some parcels of their power are forth already,
==33== And only hitherward. I leave your honors.
==34== If we and Caius Martius chance to meet,
==35== ’Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
==36== Till one can do no more.

**ALL VOL. SEN.**
==36==               The gods assist you!

**AUF.**
==37== And keep your honors safe!

**1. VOL. SEN.**
==37==                 Farewell.

**2. VOL. SEN.**
==37==                      Farewell.

**ALL VOL. SEN.**
==38== Farewell.

*Exeunt omnes.*
