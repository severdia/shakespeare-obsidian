## Act 1, Scene 6
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 1, Scene 7|Act 1, Scene 7 →]]

*Near Cominius’ camp.*

*Enter Cominius, as it were in retire, with Roman Soldiers.*

**COM.**
==1== Breathe you, my friends. Well fought; we are come off
==2== Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands
==3== Nor cowardly in retire. Believe me, sirs,
==4== We shall be charg’d again. Whiles we have struck,
==5== By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
==6== The charges of our friends. The Roman gods,
==7== Lead their successes as we wish our own,
==8== That both our powers, with smiling fronts encount’ring,
==9== May give you thankful sacrifice.
*(Enter Second Messenger.)*
==9==                   Thy news?

**2. MESS.**
==10== The citizens of Corioles have issued,
==11== And given to Lartius and to Martius battle.
==12== I saw our party to their trenches driven,
==13== And then I came away.

**COM.**
==13==            Though thou speakest truth,
==14== Methinks thou speak’st not well. How long is’t since?

**2. MESS.**
==15== Above an hour, my lord.

**COM.**
==16== ’Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums.
==17== How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
==18== And bring thy news so late?

**2. MESS.**
==18==               Spies of the Volsces
==19== Held me in chase, that I was forc’d to wheel
==20== Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
==21== Half an hour since brought my report.

*Enter Martius.*

**COM.**
==21==                      Who’s yonder,
==22== That does appear as he were flea’d? O gods,
==23== He has the stamp of Martius, and I have
==24== Before-time seen him thus.

**MAR.**
==24==               Come I too late?

**COM.**
==25== The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor
==26== More than I know the sound of Martius’ tongue
==27== From every meaner man.

**MAR.**
==27==               Come I too late?

**COM.**
==28== Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
==29== But mantled in your own.

**MAR.**
==29==               O! Let me clip ye
==30== In arms as sound as when I woo’d, in heart
==31== As merry as when our nuptial day was done
==32== And tapers burnt to bedward!

**COM.**
==32==                 Flower of warriors,
==33== How is’t with Titus Lartius?

**MAR.**
==34== As with a man busied about decrees:
==35== Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
==36== Ransoming him, or pitying, threat’ning th’ other;
==37== Holding Corioles in the name of Rome,
==38== Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
==39== To let him slip at will.

**COM.**
==39==               Where is that slave
==40== Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
==41== Where is he? Call him hither.

**MAR.**
==41==                 Let him alone,
==42== He did inform the truth. But for our gentlemen,
==43== The common file (a plague—tribunes for them!),
==44== The mouse ne’er shunn’d the cat as they did budge
==45== From rascals worse than they.

**COM.**
==45==                 But how prevail’d you?

**MAR.**
==46== Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
==47== Where is the enemy? Are you lords a’ th’ field?
==48== If not, why cease you till you are so?

**COM.**
==48==                      Martius,
==49== We have at disadvantage fought, and did
==50== Retire to win our purpose.

**MAR.**
==51== How lies their battle? Know you on which side
==52== They have plac’d their men of trust?

**COM.**
==52==                   As I guess, Martius,
==53== Their bands i’ th’ vaward are the Antiates,
==54== Of their best trust; o’er them Aufidius,
==55== Their very heart of hope.

**MAR.**
==55==               I do beseech you,
==56== By all the battles wherein we have fought,
==57== By th’ blood we have shed together, by th’ vows
==58== We have made to endure friends, that you directly
==59== Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates,
==60== And that you not delay the present, but,
==61== Filling the air with swords advanc’d and darts,
==62== We prove this very hour.

**COM.**
==62==               Though I could wish
==63== You were conducted to a gentle bath
==64== And balms applied to you, yet dare I never
==65== Deny your asking. Take your choice of those
==66== That best can aid your action.

**MAR.**
==66==                 Those are they
==67== That most are willing. If any such be here
==68== (As it were sin to doubt) that love this painting
==69== Wherein you see me smear’d; if any fear
==70== Lesser his person than an ill report;
==71== If any think brave death outweighs bad life,
==72== And that his country’s dearer than himself;
==73== Let him alone, or so many so minded,
==74== Wave thus to express his disposition,
==75== And follow Martius.
*(They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps.)*
==76== O, me alone! Make you a sword of me?
==77== If these shows be not outward, which of you
==78== But is four Volsces? None of you but is
==79== Able to bear against the great Aufidius
==80== A shield as hard as his. A certain number
==81== (Though thanks to all) must I select from all; the rest
==82== Shall bear the business in some other fight
==83== (As cause will be obey’d). Please you to march,
==84== And four shall quickly draw out my command,
==85== Which men are best inclin’d.

**COM.**
==85==                 March on, my fellows!
==86== Make good this ostentation, and you shall
==87== Divide in all with us.

*Exeunt.*
