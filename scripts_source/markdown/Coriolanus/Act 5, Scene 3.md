## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The tent of Coriolanus.*

*Enter Coriolanus and Aufidius with others.*

**COR.**
==1==We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
==2==Set down our host. My partner in this action,
==3==You must report to th’ Volscian lords, how plainly
==4==I have borne this business.

**AUF.**
==4==              Only their ends
==5==You have respected; stopp’d your ears against
==6==The general suit of Rome; never admitted
==7==A private whisper, no, not with such friends
==8==That thought them sure of you.

**COR.**
==8==                  This last old man,
==9==Whom with a crack’d heart I have sent to Rome,
==10==Lov’d me above the measure of a father,
==11==Nay, godded me indeed. Their latest refuge
==12==Was to send him; for whose old love I have
==13==(Though I show’d sourly to him) once more offer’d
==14==The first conditions, which they did refuse
==15==And cannot now accept, to grace him only
==16==That thought he could do more: a very little
==17==I have yielded to. Fresh embassies and suits,
==18==Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
==19==Will I lend ear to.
*(Shout within.)*
==19==           Ha? What shout is this?
==20==Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
==21==In the same time ’tis made? I will not.
*(Enter in mourning habits Virgilia, Volumnia, Valeria, young Martius, with Attendants.)*
==22==My wife comes foremost; then the honor’d mould
==23==Wherein this trunk was fram’d, and in her hand
==24==The grandchild to her blood. But out, affection,
==25==All bond and privilege of nature, break!
==26==Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
==27==What is that curtsy worth? Or those doves’ eyes,
==28==Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
==29==Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows,
==30==As if Olympus to a molehill should
==31==In supplication nod; and my young boy
==32==Hath an aspect of intercession, which
==33==Great Nature cries, “Deny not.” Let the Volsces
==34==Plough Rome and harrow Italy, I’ll never
==35==Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand
==36==As if a man were author of himself,
==37==And knew no other kin.

**VIR.**
==37==              My lord and husband!

**COR.**
==38==These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

**VIR.**
==39==The sorrow that delivers us thus chang’d
==40==Makes you think so.

**COR.**
==40==           Like a dull actor now
==41==I have forgot my part, and I am out,
==42==Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
==43==Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
==44==For that, “Forgive our Romans.” O, a kiss
==45==Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
==46==Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
==47==I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
==48==Hath virgin’d it e’er since. You gods, I prate,
==49==And the most noble mother of the world
==50==Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, i’ th’ earth;
*(Kneels.)*
==51==Of thy deep duty more impression show
==52==Than that of common sons.

**VOL.**
==52==              O, stand up blest!
==53==Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
==54==I kneel before thee, and unproperly
==55==Show duty as mistaken all this while
==56==Between the child and parent.

*Kneels.*

**COR.**
==56==                What’s this?
==57==Your knees to me? To your corrected son?
*(Raises her.)*
==58==Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
==59==Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
==60==Strike the proud cedars ’gainst the fiery sun,
==61==Murd’ring impossibility, to make
==62==What cannot be, slight work.

**VOL.**
==62==                Thou art my warrior,
==63==I help to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

**COR.**
==64==The noble sister of Publicola,
==65==The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
==66==That’s curdied by the frost from purest snow
==67==And hangs on Dian’s temple—dear Valeria!

**VOL.**
==68==This is a poor epitome of yours,
==69==Which by th’ interpretation of full time
==70==May show like all yourself.

**COR.**
==70==              The god of soldiers,
==71==With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
==72==Thy thoughts with nobleness, that thou mayst prove
==73==To shame unvulnerable, and stick i’ th’ wars
==74==Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
==75==And saving those that eye thee!

**VOL.**
==76==Your knee, sirrah.

**COR.**
==77==That’s my brave boy!

**VOL.**
==78==Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself
==79==Are suitors to you.

**COR.**
==79==           I beseech you peace;
==80==Or, if you’ld ask, remember this before:
==81==The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
==82==Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
==83==Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
==84==Again with Rome’s mechanics. Tell me not
==85==Wherein I seem unnatural; desire not
==86==T’ allay my rages and revenges with
==87==Your colder reasons.

**VOL.**
==87==           O, no more, no more!
==88==You have said you will not grant us any thing;
==89==For we have nothing else to ask but that
==90==Which you deny already. Yet we will ask,
==91==That, if you fail in our request, the blame
==92==May hang upon your hardness, therefore hear us.

**COR.**
==93==Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark, for we’ll
==94==Hear nought from Rome in private.
*(Sits.)*
==94==                     Your request?

**VOL.**
==95==Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
==96==And state of bodies would bewray what life
==97==We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
==98==How more unfortunate than all living women
==99==Are we come hither; since that thy sight, which should
==100==Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts,
==101==Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
==102==Making the mother, wife, and child to see
==103==The son, the husband, and the father tearing
==104==His country’s bowels out. And to poor we
==105==Thine enmity’s most capital; thou barr’st us
==106==Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
==107==That all but we enjoy. For how can we,
==108==Alas! How can we, for our country pray,
==109==Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
==110==Whereto we are bound? Alack, or we must lose
==111==The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
==112==Our comfort in the country. We must find
==113==An evident calamity, though we had
==114==Our wish, which side should win; for either thou
==115==Must as a foreign recreant be led
==116==With manacles through our streets, or else
==117==Triumphantly tread on thy country’s ruin,
==118==And bear the palm for having bravely shed
==119==Thy wife and children’s blood. For myself, son,
==120==I purpose not to wait on fortune till
==121==These wars determine. If I cannot persuade thee
==122==Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
==123==Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
==124==March to assault thy country than to tread
==125==(Trust to’t, thou shalt not) on thy mother’s womb
==126==That brought thee to this world.

**VIR.**
==126==                  Ay, and mine,
==127==That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
==128==Living to time.

**BOY.**
==128==        ’A shall not tread on me;
==129==I’ll run away till I am bigger, but then I’ll fight.

**COR.**
==130==Not of a woman’s tenderness to be,
==131==Requires nor child nor woman’s face to see.
==132==I have sate too long.

*Rises.*

**VOL.**
==132==           Nay, go not from us thus.
==133==If it were so that our request did tend
==134==To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
==135==The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
==136==As poisonous of your honor. No, our suit
==137==Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
==138==May say, “This mercy we have show’d,” the Romans,
==139==“This we receiv’d”; and each in either side
==140==Give the all-hail to thee, and cry, “Be blest
==141==For making up this peace!” Thou know’st, great son,
==142==The end of war’s uncertain; but this certain,
==143==That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
==144==Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
==145==Whose repetition will be dogg’d with curses;
==146==Whose chronicle thus writ: “The man was noble,
==147==But with his last attempt he wip’d it out,
==148==Destroy’d his country, and his name remains
==149==To th’ ensuing age abhorr’d.” Speak to me, son.
==150==Thou hast affected the fine strains of honor,
==151==To imitate the graces of the gods:
==152==To tear with thunder the wide cheeks a’ th’ air,
==153==And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
==154==That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
==155==Think’st thou it honorable for a noble man
==156==Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you;
==157==He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy;
==158==Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
==159==Than can our reasons. There’s no man in the world
==160==More bound to ’s mother, yet here he lets me prate
==161==Like one i’ th’ stocks.—Thou hast never in thy life
==162==Show’d thy dear mother any courtesy,
==163==When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
==164==Has cluck’d thee to the wars, and safely home
==165==Loaden with honor. Say my request’s unjust,
==166==And spurn me back; but if it be not so,
==167==Thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee
==168==That thou restrain’st from me the duty which
==169==To a mother’s part belongs.—He turns away.
==170==Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
==171==To his surname Coriolanus ’longs more pride
==172==Than pity to our prayers. Down! An end,
==173==This is the last. So, we will home to Rome,
==174==And die among our neighbors.—Nay, behold ’s!
==175==This boy, that cannot tell what he would have,
==176==But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship,
==177==Does reason our petition with more strength
==178==Than thou hast to deny’t.—Come, let us go.
==179==This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
==180==His wife is in Corioles, and his child
==181==Like him by chance.—Yet give us our dispatch.
==182==I am hush’d until our city be afire,
==183==And then I’ll speak a little.

*Coriolanus holds her by the hand, silent.*

**COR.**
==183==                O mother, mother!
==184==What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
==185==The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
==186==They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
==187==You have won a happy victory to Rome;
==188==But, for your son, believe it—O, believe it⁠—
==189==Most dangerously you have with him prevail’d,
==190==If not most mortal to him. But let it come.
==191==Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
==192==I’ll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
==193==Were you in my stead, would you have heard
==194==A mother less? Or granted less, Aufidius?

**AUF.**
==195==I was mov’d withal.

**COR.**
==195==           I dare be sworn you were;
==196==And, sir, it is no little thing to make
==197==Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
==198==What peace you’ll make, advise me. For my part,
==199==I’ll not to Rome, I’ll back with you, and pray you
==200==Stand to me in this cause.—O mother! Wife!

**AUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==201==I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honor
==202==At difference in thee. Out of that I’ll work
==203==Myself a former fortune.

**COR.**
*(To Volumnia, Virgilia, etc.)*
==203==              Ay, by and by;
==204==But we will drink together; and you shall bear
==205==A better witness back than words, which we,
==206==On like conditions, will have counter-seal’d.
==207==Come enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
==208==To have a temple built you. All the swords
==209==In Italy, and her confederate arms,
==210==Could not have made this peace.

*Exeunt.*
