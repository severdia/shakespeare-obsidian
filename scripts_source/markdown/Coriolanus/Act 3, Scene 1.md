## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. A street.*

*Cornets. Enter Coriolanus, Menenius, all the Gentry, Cominius, Titus Lartius, and other Senators.*

**COR.**
==1==Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

**LART.**
==2==He had, my lord, and that it was which caus’d
==3==Our swifter composition.

**COR.**
==4==So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
==5==Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road
==6==Upon ’s again.

**COM.**
==6==        They are worn, Lord Consul, so
==7==That we shall hardly in our ages see
==8==Their banners wave again.

**COR.**
==8==              Saw you Aufidius?

**LART.**
==9==On safeguard he came to me, and did curse
==10==Against the Volsces for they had so vilely
==11==Yielded the town. He is retired to Antium.

**COR.**
==12==Spoke he of me?

**LART.**
==12==           He did, my lord.

**COR.**
==12==                     How? What?

**LART.**
==13==How often he had met you, sword to sword;
==14==That of all things upon the earth he hated
==15==Your person most; that he would pawn his fortunes
==16==To hopeless restitution, so he might
==17==Be call’d your vanquisher.

**COR.**
==17==              At Antium lives he?

**LART.**
==18==At Antium.

**COR.**
==19==I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
==20==To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
*(Enter Sicinius and Brutus.)*
==21==Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
==22==The tongues o’ th’ common mouth. I do despise them!
==23==For they do prank them in authority,
==24==Against all noble sufferance.

**SIC.**
==24==                Pass no further.

**COR.**
==25==Hah? What is that?

**BRU.**
==26==It will be dangerous to go on—no further.

**COR.**
==27==What makes this change?

**MEN.**
==28==The matter?

**COM.**
==29==Hath he not pass’d the noble and the common?

**BRU.**
==30==Cominius, no.

**COR.**
==30==        Have I had children’s voices?

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==31==Tribunes, give way, he shall to th’ market-place.

**BRU.**
==32==The people are incens’d against him.

**SIC.**
==32==                       Stop,
==33==Or all will fall in broil.

**COR.**
==33==           Are these your herd?
==34==Must these have voices, that can yield them now,
==35==And straight disclaim their tongues? What are your offices?
==36==You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
==37==Have you not set them on?

**MEN.**
==37==              Be calm, be calm.

**COR.**
==38==It is a purpos’d thing, and grows by plot,
==39==To curb the will of the nobility.
==40==Suffer’t, and live with such as cannot rule,
==41==Nor ever will be ruled.

**BRU.**
==41==              Call’t not a plot.
==42==The people cry you mock’d them; and of late,
==43==When corn was given them gratis, you repin’d,
==44==Scandall’d the suppliants for the people, call’d them
==45==Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

**COR.**
==46==Why, this was known before.

**BRU.**
==46==                Not to them all.

**COR.**
==47==Have you inform’d them sithence?

**BRU.**
==47==                  How? I inform them?

**COM.**
==48==You are like to do such business.

**BRU.**
==48==                  Not unlike
==49==Each way to better yours.

**COR.**
==50==Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
==51==Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
==52==Your fellow tribune.

**SIC.**
==52==           You show too much of that
==53==For which the people stir. If you will pass
==54==To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
==55==Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
==56==Or never be so noble as a consul,
==57==Nor yoke with him for tribune.

**MEN.**
==57==                  Let’s be calm.

**COM.**
==58==The people are abus’d, set on. This palt’ring
==59==Becomes not Rome; nor has Coriolanus
==60==Deserv’d this so dishonor’d rub, laid falsely
==61==I’ th’ plain way of his merit.

**COR.**
==61==              Tell me of corn!
==62==This was my speech, and I will speak’t again⁠—

**MEN.**
==63==Not now, not now.

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==63==           Not in this heat, sir, now.

**COR.**
==64==Now, as I live, I will.
==65==My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
==66==For the mutable, rank-scented meiny, let them
==67==Regard me as I do not flatter, and
==68==Therein behold themselves. I say again,
==69==In soothing them we nourish ’gainst our Senate
==70==The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
==71==Which we ourselves have plough’d for, sow’d, and scatter’d,
==72==By mingling them with us, the honor’d number,
==73==Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
==74==Which they have given to beggars.

**MEN.**
==74==                  Well, no more.

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==75==No more words, we beseech you.

**COR.**
==75==                  How? No more?
==76==As for my country I have shed my blood,
==77==Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
==78==Coin words till their decay against those measles
==79==Which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought
==80==The very way to catch them.

**BRU.**
==80==                You speak a’ th’ people
==81==As if you were a god, to punish; not
==82==A man of their infirmity.

**SIC.**
==82==              ’Twere well
==83==We let the people know’t.

**MEN.**
==83==              What, what? His choler?

**COR.**
==84==Choler?
==85==Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
==86==By Jove, ’twould be my mind!

**SIC.**
==86==                It is a mind
==87==That shall remain a poison where it is;
==88==Not poison any further.

**COR.**
==88==              Shall remain?
==89==Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark you
==90==His absolute “shall”?

**COM.**
==90==           ’Twas from the canon.

**COR.**
==90==                         “Shall”?
==91==O good but most unwise patricians! Why,
==92==You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
==93==Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
==94==That with his peremptory “shall,” being but
==95==The horn and noise o’ th’ monster’s, wants not spirit
==96==To say he’ll turn your current in a ditch,
==97==And make your channel his? If he have power,
==98==Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
==99==Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn’d,
==100==Be not as common fools; if you are not,
==101==Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
==102==If they be senators; and they are no less,
==103==When, both your voices blended, the great’st taste
==104==Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
==105==And such a one as he, who puts his ’shall,’
==106==His popular ‘shall,’ against a graver bench
==107==Than ever frown’d in Greece. By Jove himself,
==108==It makes the consuls base; and my soul aches
==109==To know, when two authorities are up,
==110==Neither supreme, how soon confusion
==111==May enter ’twixt the gap of both, and take
==112==The one by th’ other.

**COM.**
==112==           Well, on to th’ market-place.

**COR.**
==113==Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
==114==The corn a’ th’ store-house gratis, as ’twas us’d
==115==Sometime in Greece⁠—

**MEN.**
==115==           Well, well, no more of that.

**COR.**
==116==Though there the people had more absolute pow’r,
==117==I say they nourish’d disobedience, fed
==118==The ruin of the state.

**BRU.**
==118==           Why shall the people give
==119==One that speaks thus their voice?

**COR.**
==119==                  I’ll give my reasons,
==120==More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
==121==Was not our recompense, resting well assur’d
==122==They ne’er did service for’t; being press’d to th’ war,
==123==Even when the navel of the state was touch’d,
==124==They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
==125==Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ th’ war,
==126==Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show’d
==127==Most valor, spoke not for them. Th’ accusation
==128==Which they have often made against the Senate,
==129==All cause unborn, could never be the native
==130==Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
==131==How shall this bosom multiplied digest
==132==The Senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express
==133==What’s like to be their words: “We did request it,
==134==We are the greater poll, and in true fear
==135==They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase
==136==The nature of our seats and make the rabble
==137==Call our cares fears; which will in time
==138==Break ope the locks a’ th’ Senate, and bring in
==139==The crows to peck the eagles.

**MEN.**
==139==                Come, enough.

**BRU.**
==140==Enough, with over-measure.

**COR.**
==140==                No, take more!
==141==What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
==142==Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
==143==Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
==144==Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,
==145==Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
==146==Of general ignorance—it must omit
==147==Real necessities, and give way the while
==148==To unstable slightness. Purpose so barr’d, it follows
==149==Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore beseech you⁠—
==150==You that will be less fearful than discreet;
==151==That love the fundamental part of state
==152==More than you doubt the change on’t; that prefer
==153==A noble life before a long, and wish
==154==To jump a body with a dangerous physic
==155==That’s sure of death without it—at once pluck out
==156==The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
==157==The sweet which is their poison. Your dishonor
==158==Mangles true judgment, and bereaves the state
==159==Of that integrity which should become’t;
==160==Not having the power to do the good it would,
==161==For th’ ill which doth control’t.

**BRU.**
==161==                H’as said enough.

**SIC.**
==162==H’as spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
==163==As traitors do.

**COR.**
==163==        Thou wretch, despite o’erwhelm thee!
==164==What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
==165==On whom depending, their obedience fails
==166==To th’ greater bench. In a rebellion,
==167==When what’s not meet, but what must be, was law,
==168==Then were they chosen; in a better hour,
==169==Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
==170==And throw their power i’ th’ dust.

**BRU.**
==171==Manifest treason!

**SIC.**
==171==           This a consul? No!

**BRU.**
==172==The aediles ho!
*(Enter Aediles.)*
==172==           Let him be apprehended.

**SIC.**
==173==Go call the people
*(Exit Aediles.)*
==173==           in whose name myself
==174==Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
==175==A foe to th’ public weal. Obey, I charge thee,
==176==And follow to thine answer.

**COR.**
==176==              Hence, old goat!

**PATRICIANS**
==177==We’ll surety him.

**COM.**
==177==           Ag’d sir, hands off.

**COR.**
==178==Hence, rotten thing! Or I shall shake thy bones
==179==Out of thy garments.

**SIC.**
==179==           Help, ye citizens!

*Enter a rabble of Plebeians with the Aediles.*

**MEN.**
==180==On both sides more respect.

**SIC.**
==181==Here’s he that would take from you all your power.

**BRU.**
==182==Seize him, aediles!

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==183==Down with him, down with him!

**2. ROM. SEN.**
==184==Weapons, weapons, weapons!

*They all bustle about Coriolanus.*

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==185==Tribunes!—Patricians!—Citizens!—What ho!⁠—
==186==Sicinius!—Brutus!—Coriolanus!—Citizens!⁠—
==187==Peace, peace, peace!—Stay, hold, peace!

**MEN.**
==188==What is about to be? I am out of breath,
==189==Confusion’s near, I cannot speak. You, tribunes
==190==To th’ people! Coriolanus, patience!
==191==Speak, good Sicinius.

**SIC.**
==191==           Hear me, people, peace!

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==192==Let’s hear our tribune; peace! Speak, speak, speak!

**SIC.**
==193==You are at point to lose your liberties.
==194==Martius would have all from you; Martius,
==195==Whom late you have nam’d for consul.

**MEN.**
==195==                     Fie, fie, fie!
==196==This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==197==To unbuild the city, and to lay all flat.

**SIC.**
==198==What is the city but the people?

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==198==                  True,
==199==The people are the city.

**BRU.**
==200==By the consent of all, we were establish’d
==201==The people’s magistrates.

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==201==              You so remain.

**MEN.**
==202==And so are like to do.

**COM.**
==203==That is the way to lay the city flat,
==204==To bring the roof to the foundation,
==205==And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
==206==In heaps and piles of ruin.

**SIC.**
==206==              This deserves death.

**BRU.**
==207==Or let us stand to our authority,
==208==Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
==209==Upon the part o’ th’ people, in whose power
==210==We were elected theirs, Martius is worthy
==211==Of present death.

**SIC.**
==211==           Therefore lay hold of him;
==212==Bear him to th’ rock Tarpeian, and from thence
==213==Into destruction cast him.

**BRU.**
==213==              Aediles, seize him!

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==214==Yield, Martius, yield!

**MEN.**
==214==              Hear me one word,
==215==Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.

**BOTH AEDILES.**
==216==Peace, peace!

**MEN.**
*(To Brutus.)*
==217==Be that you seem, truly your country’s friend,
==218==And temp’rately proceed to what you would
==219==Thus violently redress.

**BRU.**
==219==              Sir, those cold ways,
==220==That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
==221==Where the disease is violent.—Lay hands upon him,
==222==And bear him to the rock.

*Coriolanus draws his sword.*

**COR.**
==222==              No, I’ll die here.
==223==There’s some among you have beheld me fighting;
==224==Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

**MEN.**
==225==Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw a while.

**BRU.**
==226==Lay hands upon him.

**MEN.**
==226==           Help Martius, help!
==227==You that be noble, help him, young and old!

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==228==Down with him, down with him!

*In this mutiny the Tribunes, the Aediles, and the People are beat in and exeunt.*

**MEN.**
*(To Coriolanus.)*
==229==Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
==230==All will be naught else.

**2. ROM. SEN.**
==230==           Get you gone.

**COR.**
==230==                       Stand fast,
==231==We have as many friends as enemies.

**MEN.**
==232==Shall it be put to that?

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==232==           The gods forbid!
==233==I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
==234==Leave us to cure this cause.

**MEN.**
==234==              For ’tis a sore upon us
==235==You cannot tent yourself. Be gone, beseech you.

**COM.**
==236==Come, sir, along with us.

**COR.**
==237==I would they were barbarians, as they are,
==238==Though in Rome litter’d; not Romans, as they are not,
==239==Though calved i’ th’ porch o’ th’ Capitol!

**MEN.**
==239==                       Be gone!
==240==Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
==241==One time will owe another.

**COR.**
==241==              On fair ground
==242==I could beat forty of them.

**MEN.**
==242==              I could myself
==243==Take up a brace o’ th’ best of them, yea, the two tribunes.

**COM.**
==244==But now ’tis odds beyond arithmetic,
==245==And manhood is call’d foolery when it stands
==246==Against a falling fabric. Will you hence
==247==Before the tag return, whose rage doth rend
==248==Like interrupted waters, and o’erbear
==249==What they are us’d to bear?

**MEN.**
==249==                Pray you be gone.
==250==I’ll try whether my old wit be in request
==251==With those that have but little. This must be patch’d
==252==With cloth of any color.

**COM.**
==252==              Nay, come away.

*Exeunt Coriolanus and Cominius with others.*

**PATRICIAN.**
==253==This man has marr’d his fortune.

**MEN.**
==254==His nature is too noble for the world;
==255==He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
==256==Or Jove for’s power to thunder. His heart’s his mouth;
==257==What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent,
==258==And, being angry, does forget that ever
==259==He heard the name of death.
*(A noise within.)*
==260==Here’s goodly work!

**PATRICIAN.**
==260==           I would they were a-bed!

**MEN.**
==261==I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance,
==262==Could he not speak ’em fair?

*Enter Brutus and Sicinius with the rabble again.*

**SIC.**
==262==                Where is this viper
==263==That would depopulate the city and
==264==Be every man himself?

**MEN.**
==264==              You worthy tribunes⁠—

**SIC.**
==265==He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
==266==With rigorous hands. He hath resisted law,
==267==And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
==268==Than the severity of the public power,
==269==Which he so sets at nought.

**1. ROM. CIT.**
==269==                He shall well know
==270==The noble tribunes are the people’s mouths,
==271==And we their hands.

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==271==           He shall, sure on’t.

**MEN.**
==271==                       Sir, sir⁠—

**SIC.**
==272==Peace!

**MEN.**
==273==Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
==274==With modest warrant.

**SIC.**
==274==           Sir, how comes’t that you
==275==Have help to make this rescue?

**MEN.**
==275==                  Hear me speak!
==276==As I do know the consul’s worthiness,
==277==So can I name his faults.

**SIC.**
==277==              Consul? What consul?

**MEN.**
==278==The consul Coriolanus.

**BRU.**
==278==              He consul!

**ALL PLEBEIANS.**
==279==No, no, no, no, no.

**MEN.**
==280==If, by the tribunes’ leave, and yours, good people,
==281==I may be heard, I would crave a word or two,
==282==The which shall turn you to no further harm
==283==Than so much loss of time.

**SIC.**
==283==              Speak briefly then,
==284==For we are peremptory to dispatch
==285==This viperous traitor. To eject him hence
==286==Were but one danger, and to keep him here
==287==Our certain death; therefore it is decreed
==288==He dies tonight.

**MEN.**
==288==        Now the good gods forbid
==289==That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
==290==Towards her deserved children is enroll’d
==291==In Jove’s own book, like an unnatural dam
==292==Should now eat up her own!

**SIC.**
==293==He’s a disease that must be cut away.

**MEN.**
==294==O, he’s a limb that has but a disease:
==295==Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
==296==What has he done to Rome that’s worthy death?
==297==Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost
==298==(Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath
==299==By many an ounce) he dropp’d it for his country;
==300==And what is left, to lose it by his country
==301==Were to us all that do’t and suffer it
==302==A brand to th’ end a’ th’ world.

**SIC.**
==302==                  This is clean kam.

**BRU.**
==303==Merely awry. When he did love his country,
==304==It honor’d him.

**MEN.**
==304==        The service of the foot,
==305==Being once gangren’d, is not then respected
==306==For what before it was.

**BRU.**
==306==              We’ll hear no more.
==307==Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence,
==308==Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
==309==Spread further.

**MEN.**
==309==        One word more, one word:
==310==This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
==311==The harm of unscann’d swiftness, will (too late) 
==312==Tie leaden pounds to ’s heels. Proceed by process,
==313==Lest parties (as he is belov’d) break out,
==314==And sack great Rome with Romans.

**BRU.**
==314==                  If it were so⁠—

**SIC.**
==315==What do ye talk?
==316==Have we not had a taste of his obedience⁠—
==317==Our aediles smote, ourselves resisted? Come.

**MEN.**
==318==Consider this: he has been bred i’ th’ wars
==319==Since ’a could draw a sword, and is ill school’d
==320==In bolted language; meal and bran together
==321==He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
==322==I’ll go to him, and undertake to bring him
==323==Where he shall answer, by a lawful form
==324==(In peace), to his utmost peril.

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==324==                Noble tribunes,
==325==It is the humane way. The other course
==326==Will prove too bloody; and the end of it
==327==Unknown to the beginning.

**SIC.**
==327==              Noble Menenius,
==328==Be you then as the people’s officer.
==329==Masters, lay down your weapons.

**BRU.**
==329==                  Go not home.

**SIC.**
==330==Meet on the market-place. We’ll attend you there;
==331==Where if you bring not Martius, we’ll proceed
==332==In our first way.

**MEN.**
==332==        I’ll bring him to you.
*(To the Senators.)*
==333==Let me desire your company. He must come,
==334==Or what is worst will follow.

**1. ROM. SEN.**
==334==                Pray you let’s to him.

*Exeunt omnes.*
