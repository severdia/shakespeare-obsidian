## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 1, Scene 5|Act 1, Scene 5 →]]

*Before Corioli.*

*Enter Martius, Titus Lartius, with Drum and Colors, with Captains and Roman Soldiers, as before the city Corioli; to them a Messenger.*

**MAR.**
==1==Yonder comes news: a wager they have met.

**LART.**
==2==My horse to yours, no.

**MAR.**
==2==              ’Tis done.

**LART.**
==2==                       Agreed.

**MAR.**
==3==Say, has our general met the enemy?

**2. MESS.**
==4==They lie in view, but have not spoke as yet.

**LART.**
==5==So, the good horse is mine.

**MAR.**
==5==                I’ll buy him of you.

**LART.**
==6==No, I’ll nor sell nor give him; lend you him I will
==7==For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

**MAR.**
==8==How far off lie these armies?

**2. MESS.**
==8==              Within this mile and half.

**MAR.**
==9==Then shall we hear their ’larum, and they ours.
==10==Now, Mars, I prithee make us quick in work,
==11==That we with smoking swords may march from hence
==12==To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
*(They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls of Corioli.)*
==13==Tullus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

**1. VOL. SEN.**
==14==No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
==15==That’s lesser than a little.
*(Drum afar off.)*
==15==              Hark, our drums
==16==Are bringing forth our youth. We’ll break our walls
==17==Rather than they shall pound us up; our gates,
==18==Which yet seem shut, we have but pinn’d with rushes,
==19==They’ll open of themselves.
*(Alarum far off.)*
==19==                Hark you, far off!
==20==There is Aufidius. List what work he makes
==21==Amongst your cloven army.

**MAR.**
==21==                O, they are at it!

**LART.**
==22==Their noise be our instruction. Ladders ho!

*Enter the Army of the Volsces.*

**MAR.**
==23==They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
==24==Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
==25==With hearts more proof than shields. Advance, brave Titus!
==26==They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
==27==Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows!
==28==He that retires, I’ll take him for a Volsce,
==29==And he shall feel mine edge.

*Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches.*

*Enter Martius cursing.*

**MAR.**
==30==All the contagion of the south light on you,
==31==You shames of Rome! You herd of—Biles and plagues
==32==Plaster you o’er, that you may be abhorr’d
==33==Farther than seen, and one infect another
==34==Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
==35==That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
==36==From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
==37==All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces pale
==38==With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
==39==Or, by the fires of heaven, I’ll leave the foe
==40==And make my wars on you. Look to’t; come on!
==41==If you’ll stand fast, we’ll beat them to their wives,
==42==As they us to our trenches. Follow ’s.
*(Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and Martius follows them to the gates.)*
==43==So, now the gates are ope; now prove good seconds:
==44==’Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
==45==Not for the fliers. Mark me, and do the like.

*Enter the gates.*

**1. ROM. SOLD.**
==46==Foolhardiness, not I.

**2. ROM. SOLD.**
==46==                Nor I.

*Martius is shut in.*

**1. ROM. SOLD.**
==47==See, they have shut him in.

*Alarum continues.*

**ALL ROM. SOLD.**
==47==              To th’ pot, I warrant him.

*Enter Titus Lartius.*

**LART.**
==48==What is become of Martius?

**ALL ROM. SOLD.**
==48==                Slain, sir, doubtless.

**1. ROM. SOLD.**
==49==Following the fliers at the very heels,
==50==With them he enters; who upon the sudden
==51==Clapp’d to their gates. He is himself alone,
==52==To answer all the city.

**LART.**
==52==              O noble fellow!
==53==Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
==54==And when it bows, stand’st up. Thou art left, Martius⁠—
==55==A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
==56==Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
==57==Even to Cato’s wish, not fierce and terrible
==58==Only in strokes, but, with thy grim looks and
==59==The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
==60==Thou mad’st thine enemies shake, as if the world
==61==Were feverous and did tremble.

*Enter Martius bleeding, assaulted by the enemy.*

**1. ROM. SOLD.**
==61==                Look, sir.

**LART.**
==61==                     O, ’tis Martius!
==62==Let’s fetch him off, or make remain alike.

*They fight, and all enter the city.*
