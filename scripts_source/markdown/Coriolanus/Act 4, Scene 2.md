## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Rome. A street near the gate of the city.*

*Enter Sicinius and Brutus, with the Aedile.*

**SIC.**
==1== Bid them all home, he’s gone; and we’ll no further.
==2== The nobility are vexed, whom we see have sided
==3== In his behalf.

**BRU.**
==3==         Now we have shown our power,
==4== Let us seem humbler after it is done
==5== Than when it was a-doing.

**SIC.**
==5==               Bid them home.
==6== Say their great enemy is gone, and they
==7== Stand in their ancient strength.

**BRU.**
==7==                 Dismiss them home.
*(Exit Aedile.)*
==8== Here comes his mother.

*Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Menenius.*

**SIC.**
==8==               Let’s not meet her.

**BRU.**
==8==                          Why?

**SIC.**
==9== They say she’s mad.

**BRU.**
==10== They have ta’en note of us; keep on your way.

**VOL.**
==11== O, y’ are well met. The hoarded plague a’ th’ gods
==12== Requite your love!

**MEN.**
==12==            Peace, peace, be not so loud.

**VOL.**
==13== If that I could for weeping, you should hear⁠—
==14== Nay, and you shall hear some.
*(To Brutus.)*
==15== Will you be gone?

**VIR.**
*(To Sicinius.)*
==16== You shall stay too. I would I had the power
==17== To say so to my husband.

**SIC.**
==17==               Are you mankind?

**VOL.**
==18== Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this fool.
==19== Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
==20== To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
==21== Than thou hast spoken words?

**SIC.**
==21==                 O blessed heavens!

**VOL.**
==22== More noble blows than ever thou wise words,
==23== And for Rome’s good. I’ll tell thee what—yet go!
==24== Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son
==25== Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
==26== His good sword in his hand.

**SIC.**
==26==               What then?

**VIR.**
==26==                      What then?
==27== He’ld make an end of thy posterity.

**VOL.**
==28== Bastards and all!
==29== Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

**MEN.**
==30== Come, come, peace.

**SIC.**
==31== I would he had continued to his country
==32== As he began, and not unknit himself
==33== The noble knot he made.

**BRU.**
==33==               I would he had.

**VOL.**
==34== “I would he had”? ’Twas you incens’d the rabble;
==35== Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
==36== As I can of those mysteries which heaven
==37== Will not have earth to know.

**BRU.**
==37==                 Pray let’s go.

**VOL.**
==38== Now pray, sir, get you gone;
==39== You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:
==40== As far as doth the Capitol exceed
==41== The meanest house in Rome, so far my son,
==42== This lady’s husband here—this (do you see?) 
==43== Whom you have banish’d—does exceed you all.

**BRU.**
==44== Well, well, we’ll leave you.

**SIC.**
==44==               Why stay we to be baited
==45== With one that wants her wits?

*Exeunt Tribunes.*

**VOL.**
==45==                 Take my prayers with you.
==46== I would the gods had nothing else to do
==47== But to confirm my curses! Could I meet ’em
==48== But once a day, it would unclog my heart
==49== Of what lies heavy to’t.

**MEN.**
==49==               You have told them home,
==50== And, by my troth, you have cause. You’ll sup with me?

**VOL.**
==51== Anger’s my meat; I sup upon myself,
==52== And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let’s go.
*(To Virgilia.)*
==53== Leave this faint puling, and lament as I do,
==54== In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

*Exeunt Volumnia and Virgilia.*

**MEN.**
==55== Fie, fie, fie!

*Exit.*
