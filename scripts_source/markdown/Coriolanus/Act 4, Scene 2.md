## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Rome. A street near the gate of the city.*

*Enter Sicinius and Brutus, with the Aedile.*

**SIC.**
Bid them all home, he’s gone; and we’ll no further.
The nobility are vexed, whom we see have sided
In his behalf.

**BRU.**
        Now we have shown our power,
Let us seem humbler after it is done
Than when it was a-doing.

**SIC.**
              Bid them home.
Say their great enemy is gone, and they
Stand in their ancient strength.

**BRU.**
                Dismiss them home.
*(Exit Aedile.)*
Here comes his mother.

*Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and Menenius.*

**SIC.**
              Let’s not meet her.

**BRU.**
                         Why?

**SIC.**
They say she’s mad.

**BRU.**
They have ta’en note of us; keep on your way.

**VOL.**
O, y’ are well met. The hoarded plague a’ th’ gods
Requite your love!

**MEN.**
           Peace, peace, be not so loud.

**VOL.**
If that I could for weeping, you should hear⁠—
Nay, and you shall hear some.
*(To Brutus.)*
Will you be gone?

**VIR.**
*(To Sicinius.)*
You shall stay too. I would I had the power
To say so to my husband.

**SIC.**
              Are you mankind?

**VOL.**
Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this fool.
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
Than thou hast spoken words?

**SIC.**
                O blessed heavens!

**VOL.**
More noble blows than ever thou wise words,
And for Rome’s good. I’ll tell thee what—yet go!
Nay, but thou shalt stay too. I would my son
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
His good sword in his hand.

**SIC.**
              What then?

**VIR.**
                     What then?
He’ld make an end of thy posterity.

**VOL.**
Bastards and all!
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

**MEN.**
Come, come, peace.

**SIC.**
I would he had continued to his country
As he began, and not unknit himself
The noble knot he made.

**BRU.**
              I would he had.

**VOL.**
“I would he had”? ’Twas you incens’d the rabble;
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
As I can of those mysteries which heaven
Will not have earth to know.

**BRU.**
                Pray let’s go.

**VOL.**
Now pray, sir, get you gone;
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:
As far as doth the Capitol exceed
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son,
This lady’s husband here—this (do you see?) 
Whom you have banish’d—does exceed you all.

**BRU.**
Well, well, we’ll leave you.

**SIC.**
              Why stay we to be baited
With one that wants her wits?

*Exeunt Tribunes.*

**VOL.**
                Take my prayers with you.
I would the gods had nothing else to do
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet ’em
But once a day, it would unclog my heart
Of what lies heavy to’t.

**MEN.**
              You have told them home,
And, by my troth, you have cause. You’ll sup with me?

**VOL.**
Anger’s my meat; I sup upon myself,
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let’s go.
*(To Virgilia.)*
Leave this faint puling, and lament as I do,
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

*Exeunt Volumnia and Virgilia.*

**MEN.**
Fie, fie, fie!

*Exit.*
