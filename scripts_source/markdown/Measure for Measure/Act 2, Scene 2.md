## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Another room in Angelo’s house.*

*Enter Provost, Servant.*

**SERV.**
==1==He’s hearing of a cause; he will come straight.
==2==I’ll tell him of you.

**PROV.**
==2==           Pray you do.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==2==                     I’ll know
==3==His pleasure, may be he will relent. Alas,
==4==He hath but as offended in a dream!
==5==All sects, all ages smack of this vice, and he
==6==To die for’t!

*Enter Angelo.*

**ANG.**
==6==        Now, what’s the matter, Provost?

**PROV.**
==7==Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

**ANG.**
==8==Did not I tell thee yea? Hadst thou not order?
==9==Why dost thou ask again?

**PROV.**
==9==              Lest I might be too rash.
==10==Under your good correction, I have seen
==11==When, after execution, judgment hath
==12==Repented o’er his doom.

**ANG.**
==12==              Go to; let that be mine.
==13==Do you your office, or give up your place,
==14==And you shall well be spar’d.

**PROV.**
==14==                I crave your honor’s pardon.
==15==What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
==16==She’s very near her hour.

**ANG.**
==16==              Dispose of her
==17==To some more fitter place; and that with speed.

*Enter Servant.*

**SERV.**
==18==Here is the sister of the man condemn’d
==19==Desires access to you.

**ANG.**
==19==           Hath he a sister?

**PROV.**
==20==Ay, my good lord, a very virtuous maid,
==21==And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
==22==If not already.

**ANG.**
==23==Well; let her be admitted.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==24==See you the fornicatress be remov’d.
==25==Let her have needful but not lavish means;
==26==There shall be order for’t.

*Enter Lucio and Isabella.*

**PROV.**
==26==              ’Save your honor!

**ANG.**
==27==Stay a little while.
*(To Isabella.)*
==27==        Y’ are welcome; what’s your will?

**ISAB.**
==28==I am a woeful suitor to your honor,
==29==Please but your honor hear me.

**ANG.**
==29==                Well; what’s your suit?

**ISAB.**
==30==There is a vice that most I do abhor,
==31==And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
==32==For which I would not plead, but that I must;
==33==For which I must not plead, but that I am
==34==At war ’twixt will and will not.

**ANG.**
==34==                  Well; the matter?

**ISAB.**
==35==I have a brother is condemn’d to die;
==36==I do beseech you let it be his fault,
==37==And not my brother.

**PROV.**
*(Aside.)*
==38==Heaven give thee moving graces!

**ANG.**
==39==Condemn the fault, and not the actor of it?
==40==Why, every fault’s condemn’d ere it be done.
==41==Mine were the very cipher of a function,
==42==To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
==43==And let go by the actor.

**ISAB.**
==43==              O just but severe law!
==44==I had a brother then. Heaven keep your honor!

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==45==Give’t not o’er so. To him again, entreat him,
==46==Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown;
==47==You are too cold. If you should need a pin,
==48==You could not with more tame a tongue desire it;
==49==To him, I say!

**ISAB.**
==50==Must he needs die?

**ANG.**
==50==           Maiden, no remedy.

**ISAB.**
==51==Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
==52==And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

**ANG.**
==53==I will not do’t.

**ISAB.**
==53==        But can you if you would?

**ANG.**
==54==Look what I will not, that I cannot do.

**ISAB.**
==55==But might you do’t, and do the world no wrong,
==56==If so your heart were touch’d with that remorse
==57==As mine is to him?

**ANG.**
==57==           He’s sentenc’d; ’tis too late.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==58==You are too cold.

**ISAB.**
==59==Too late? Why, no; I that do speak a word
==60==May call it again. Well, believe this,
==61==No ceremony that to great ones ’longs,
==62==Not the king’s crown, nor the deputed sword,
==63==The marshal’s truncheon, nor the judge’s robe,
==64==Become them with one half so good a grace
==65==As mercy does.
==66==If he had been as you, and you as he,
==67==You would have slipp’d like him, but he, like you,
==68==Would not have been so stern.

**ANG.**
==68==                Pray you be gone.

**ISAB.**
==69==I would to heaven I had your potency,
==70==And you were Isabel! Should it then be thus?
==71==No; I would tell what ’twere to be a judge,
==72==And what a prisoner.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella.)*
==72==           Ay, touch him; there’s the vein.

**ANG.**
==73==Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
==74==And you but waste your words.

**ISAB.**
==74==                  Alas, alas!
==75==Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once,
==76==And He that might the vantage best have took
==77==Found out the remedy. How would you be
==78==If He, which is the top of judgment, should
==79==But judge you as you are? O, think on that,
==80==And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
==81==Like man new made.

**ANG.**
==81==           Be you content, fair maid,
==82==It is the law, not I, condemn your brother.
==83==Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
==84==It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

**ISAB.**
==85==Tomorrow? O, that’s sudden! Spare him, spare him!
==86==He’s not prepar’d for death. Even for our kitchens
==87==We kill the fowl of season. Shall we serve heaven
==88==With less respect than we do minister
==89==To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you:
==90==Who is it that hath died for this offense?
==91==There’s many have committed it.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==91==                  Ay, well said.

**ANG.**
==92==The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept.
==93==Those many had not dar’d to do that evil
==94==If the first that did th’ edict infringe
==95==Had answer’d for his deed. Now ’tis awake,
==96==Takes note of what is done, and like a prophet
==97==Looks in a glass that shows what future evils,
==98==Either now, or by remissness new conceiv’d,
==99==And so in progress to be hatch’d and born,
==100==Are now to have no successive degrees,
==101==But here they live, to end.

**ISAB.**
==101==              Yet show some pity.

**ANG.**
==102==I show it most of all when I show justice;
==103==For then I pity those I do not know,
==104==Which a dismiss’d offense would after gall,
==105==And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
==106==Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
==107==Your brother dies tomorrow; be content.

**ISAB.**
==108==So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
==109==And he, that suffers. O, it is excellent
==110==To have a giant’s strength; but it is tyrannous
==111==To use it like a giant.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==111==           That’s well said.

**ISAB.**
==112==Could great men thunder
==113==As Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,
==114==For every pelting, petty officer
==115==Would use his heaven for thunder,
==116==Nothing but thunder! Merciful heaven,
==117==Thou rather with thy sharp and sulfurous bolt
==118==Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
==119==Than the soft myrtle; but man, proud man,
==120==Dress’d in a little brief authority,
==121==Most ignorant of what he’s most assur’d
==122==(His glassy essence), like an angry ape
==123==Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
==124==As makes the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
==125==Would all themselves laugh mortal.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==126==O, to him, to him, wench! He will relent.
==127==He’s coming; I perceive’t.

**PROV.**
*(Aside.)*
==127==              Pray heaven she win him!

**ISAB.**
==128==We cannot weigh our brother with ourself.
==129==Great men may jest with saints; ’tis wit in them,
==130==But in the less foul profanation.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==131==Thou’rt i’ th’ right, girl, more o’ that.

**ISAB.**
==132==That in the captain’s but a choleric word,
==133==Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==134==Art avis’d o’ that? More on’t.

**ANG.**
==135==Why do you put these sayings upon me?

**ISAB.**
==136==Because authority, though it err like others,
==137==Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
==138==That skins the vice o’ th’ top. Go to your bosom,
==139==Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
==140==That’s like my brother’s fault. If it confess
==141==A natural guiltiness such as is his,
==142==Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
==143==Against my brother’s life.

**ANG.**
*(Aside.)*
==143==              She speaks, and ’tis
==144==Such sense that my sense breeds with it.—Fare you well.

**ISAB.**
==145==Gentle my lord, turn back.

**ANG.**
==146==I will bethink me. Come again tomorrow.

**ISAB.**
==147==Hark how I’ll bribe you. Good my lord, turn back.

**ANG.**
==148==How? Bribe me?

**ISAB.**
==149==Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==150==You had marr’d all else.

**ISAB.**
==151==Not with fond sicles of the tested gold,
==152==Or stones, whose rate are either rich or poor
==153==As fancy values them; but with true prayers,
==154==That shall be up at heaven, and enter there
==155==Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
==156==From fasting maids, whose minds are dedicate
==157==To nothing temporal.

**ANG.**
==157==           Well; come to me tomorrow.

**LUCIO.**
*(Aside to Isabella)*
==158==Go to; ’tis well. Away!

**ISAB.**
==159==Heaven keep your honor safe!

**ANG.**
*(Aside.)*
==159==                Amen!
==160==For I am that way going to temptation,
==161==Where prayers cross.

**ISAB.**
==161==           At what hour tomorrow
==162==Shall I attend your lordship?

**ANG.**
==162==              At any time ’fore noon.

**ISAB.**
==163==’Save your honor!

*Exeunt Isabella, Lucio, and Provost.*

**ANG.**
==163==           From thee: even from thy virtue.
==164==What’s this? What’s this? Is this her fault, or mine?
==165==The tempter, or the tempted, who sins most, ha?
==166==Not she; nor doth she tempt; but it is I
==167==That, lying by the violet in the sun,
==168==Do as the carrion does, not as the flow’r,
==169==Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
==170==That modesty may more betray our sense
==171==Than woman’s lightness? Having waste ground enough,
==172==Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
==173==And pitch our evils there? O fie, fie, fie!
==174==What dost thou? Or what art thou, Angelo?
==175==Dost thou desire her foully for those things
==176==That make her good? O, let her brother live!
==177==Thieves for their robbery have authority
==178==When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
==179==That I desire to hear her speak again?
==180==And feast upon her eyes? What is’t I dream on?
==181==O cunning enemy, that to catch a saint,
==182==With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
==183==Is that temptation that doth goad us on
==184==To sin in loving virtue. Never could the strumpet,
==185==With all her double vigor, art and nature,
==186==Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
==187==Subdues me quite. Ever till now,
==188==When men were fond, I smil’d and wond’red how.

*Exit.*
