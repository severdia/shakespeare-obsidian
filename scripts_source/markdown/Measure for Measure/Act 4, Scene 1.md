## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*The moated grange at St. Luke’s.*

*Enter Mariana, and Boy singing.*

*Song.*

**BOY.**
==1== *Take, O, take those lips away,*
==2==    *That so sweetly were forsworn,*
==3== *And those eyes, the break of day,*
==4==    *Lights that do mislead the morn;*
==5== *But my kisses bring again, bring again,*
==6== *Seals of love, but seal’d in vain, seal’d in vain.*

*Enter Duke disguised as a friar.*

**MAR.**
==7==Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away.
==8==Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
==9==Hath often still’d my brawling discontent.
*(Exit Boy.)*
==10==I cry you mercy, sir, and well could wish
==11==You had not found me here so musical.
==12==Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
==13==My mirth it much displeas’d, but pleas’d my woe.

**DUKE.**
==14==’Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
==15==To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
==16==I pray you tell me, hath any body inquir’d for me here today? Much upon this time have I promis’d here to meet.

**MAR.**
==17==You have not been inquir’d after. I have sat here all day.

*Enter Isabel.*

**DUKE.**
==18==I do constantly believe you. The time is come even now. I shall crave your forbearance a little. May be I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself.

**MAR.**
==19==I am always bound to you.

*Exit.*

**DUKE.**
==20==Very well met, and well come.
==21==What is the news from this good deputy?

**ISAB.**
==22==He hath a garden circummur’d with brick,
==23==Whose western side is with a vineyard back’d;
==24==And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
==25==That makes his opening with this bigger key.
==26==This other doth command a little door,
==27==Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
==28==There have I made my promise upon the heavy
==29==Middle of the night to call upon him.

**DUKE.**
==30==But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

**ISAB.**
==31==I have ta’en a due and wary note upon’t.
==32==With whispering and most guilty diligence,
==33==In action all of precept, he did show me
==34==The way twice o’er.

**DUKE.**
==34==           Are there no other tokens
==35==Between you ’greed concerning her observance?

**ISAB.**
==36==No; none but only a repair i’ th’ dark,
==37==And that I have possess’d him my most stay
==38==Can be but brief; for I have made him know
==39==I have a servant comes with me along,
==40==That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
==41==I come about my brother.

**DUKE.**
==41==              ’Tis well borne up.
==42==I have not yet made known to Mariana
==43==A word of this. What ho, within! Come forth!
*(Enter Mariana.)*
==44==I pray you be acquainted with this maid,
==45==She comes to do you good.

**ISAB.**
==45==              I do desire the like.

**DUKE.**
==46==Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

**MAR.**
==47==Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

**DUKE.**
==48==Take then this your companion by the hand,
==49==Who hath a story ready for your ear.
==50==I shall attend your leisure, but make haste,
==51==The vaporous night approaches.

**MAR.**
==52==Will’t please you walk aside?

*Exit with Isabella.*

**DUKE.**
==53==O place and greatness! Millions of false eyes
==54==Are stuck upon thee. Volumes of report
==55==Run with these false, and most contrarious quest
==56==Upon thy doings; thousand escapes of wit
==57==Make thee the father of their idle dream,
==58==And rack thee in their fancies.
*(Enter Mariana and Isabella.)*
==59==Welcome, how agreed?

**ISAB.**
==60==She’ll take the enterprise upon her, father,
==61==If you advise it.

**DUKE.**
==61==        It is not my consent,
==62==But my entreaty too.

**ISAB.**
==62==           Little have you to say
==63==When you depart from him, but soft and low,
==64==“Remember now my brother.”

**MAR.**
==64==                Fear me not.

**DUKE.**
==65==Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
==66==He is your husband on a pre-contract:
==67==To bring you thus together ’tis no sin,
==68==Sith that the justice of your title to him
==69==Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go,
==70==Our corn’s to reap, for yet our tithe’s to sow.

*Exeunt.*
