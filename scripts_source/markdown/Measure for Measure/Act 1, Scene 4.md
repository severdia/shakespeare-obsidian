## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Vienna. A nunnery.*

*Enter Isabel and Francisca, a nun.*

**ISAB.**
==1==And have you nuns no farther privileges?

**FRAN.**
==2==Are not these large enough?

**ISAB.**
==3==Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more,
==4==But rather wishing a more strict restraint
==5==Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

**LUCIO.**
*(Within.)*
==6==Ho! Peace be in this place!

**ISAB.**
==6==              Who’s that which calls?

**FRAN.**
==7==It is a man’s voice. Gentle Isabella,
==8==Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
==9==You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
==10==When you have vow’d, you must not speak with men
==11==But in the presence of the prioress;
==12==Then if you speak, you must not show your face,
==13==Or if you show your face, you must not speak.
==14==He calls again; I pray you answer him.

*Exit.*

**ISAB.**
==15==Peace and prosperity! Who is’t that calls?

*Enter Lucio.*

**LUCIO.**
==16==Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
==17==Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
==18==As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
==19==A novice of this place, and the fair sister
==20==To her unhappy brother Claudio?

**ISAB.**
==21==Why “her unhappy brother”? Let me ask,
==22==The rather for I now must make you know
==23==I am that Isabella, and his sister.

**LUCIO.**
==24==Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you.
==25==Not to be weary with you, he’s in prison.

**ISAB.**
==26==Woe me! For what?

**LUCIO.**
==27==For that which, if myself might be his judge,
==28==He should receive his punishment in thanks:
==29==He hath got his friend with child.

**ISAB.**
==30==Sir, make me not your story.

**LUCIO.**
==30==                ’Tis true.
==31==I would not—though ’tis my familiar sin
==32==With maids to seem the lapwing, and to jest,
==33==Tongue far from heart—play with all virgins so.
==34==I hold you as a thing enskied, and sainted,
==35==By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
==36==And to be talk’d with in sincerity,
==37==As with a saint.

**ISAB.**
==38==You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

**LUCIO.**
==39==Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus:
==40==Your brother and his lover have embrac’d.
==41==As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
==42==That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
==43==To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
==44==Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

**ISAB.**
==45==Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

**LUCIO.**
==46==Is she your cousin?

**ISAB.**
==47==Adoptedly, as school-maids change their names
==48==By vain though apt affection.

**LUCIO.**
==48==                She it is.

**ISAB.**
==49==O, let him marry her.

**LUCIO.**
==49==           This is the point.
==50==The Duke is very strangely gone from hence;
==51==Bore many gentlemen (myself being one) 
==52==In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn
==53==By those that know the very nerves of state,
==54==His givings-out were of an infinite distance
==55==From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
==56==And with full line of his authority,
==57==Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood
==58==Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
==59==The wanton stings and motions of the sense;
==60==But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
==61==With profits of the mind: study and fast.
==62==He (to give fear to use and liberty,
==63==Which have for long run by the hideous law,
==64==As mice by lions) hath pick’d out an act,
==65==Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life
==66==Falls into forfeit; he arrests him on it,
==67==And follows close the rigor of the statute,
==68==To make him an example. All hope is gone,
==69==Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
==70==To soften Angelo. And that’s my pith
==71==Of business ’twixt you and your poor brother.

**ISAB.**
==72==Doth he so seek his life?

**LUCIO.**
==72==              H’as censur’d him
==73==Already, and as I hear, the Provost hath
==74==A warrant for ’s execution.

**ISAB.**
==75==Alas, what poor ability’s in me
==76==To do him good!

**LUCIO.**
==76==        Assay the pow’r you have.

**ISAB.**
==77==My power? Alas, I doubt⁠—

**LUCIO.**
==77==              Our doubts are traitors,
==78==And makes us lose the good we oft might win,
==79==By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
==80==And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
==81==Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
==82==All their petitions are as freely theirs
==83==As they themselves would owe them.

**ISAB.**
==84==I’ll see what I can do.

**LUCIO.**
==84==           But speedily.

**ISAB.**
==85==I will about it straight;
==86==No longer staying but to give the Mother
==87==Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you.
==88==Commend me to my brother. Soon at night
==89==I’ll send him certain word of my success.

**LUCIO.**
==90==I take my leave of you.

**ISAB.**
==90==              Good sir, *adieu*.

*Exeunt severally.*
