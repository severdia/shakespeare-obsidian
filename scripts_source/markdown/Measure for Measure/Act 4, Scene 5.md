## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Fields without the town.*

*Enter Duke in his own habit and Friar Peter.*

**DUKE.**
These letters at fit time deliver me.
*(Giving letters.)*
The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.
The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
And hold you ever to our special drift,
Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavio’s house,
And tell him where I stay. Give the like notice
To Valentius, Rowland, and to Crassus,
And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate.
But send me Flavius first.

**FRI. PET.**
              It shall be speeded well.

*Exit.*

*Enter Varrius.*

**DUKE.**
I thank thee, Varrius, thou hast made good haste.
Come, we will walk. There’s other of our friends
Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius!

*Exeunt.*
