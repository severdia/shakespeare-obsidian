## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Fields without the town.*

*Enter Duke in his own habit and Friar Peter.*

**DUKE.**
==1== These letters at fit time deliver me.
*(Giving letters.)*
==2== The Provost knows our purpose and our plot.
==3== The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
==4== And hold you ever to our special drift,
==5== Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
==6== As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavio’s house,
==7== And tell him where I stay. Give the like notice
==8== To Valentius, Rowland, and to Crassus,
==9== And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate.
==10== But send me Flavius first.

**FRI. PET.**
==10==               It shall be speeded well.

*Exit.*

*Enter Varrius.*

**DUKE.**
==11== I thank thee, Varrius, thou hast made good haste.
==12== Come, we will walk. There’s other of our friends
==13== Will greet us here anon. My gentle Varrius!

*Exeunt.*
