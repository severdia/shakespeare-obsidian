## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Vienna. A monastery.*

*Enter Duke and Friar Peter.*

**DUKE.**
==1==No; holy father, throw away that thought;
==2==Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
==3==Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
==4==To give me secret harbor, hath a purpose
==5==More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
==6==Of burning youth.

**FRI. PET.**
==6==           May your Grace speak of it?

**DUKE.**
==7==My holy sir, none better knows than you
==8==How I have ever lov’d the life removed,
==9==And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
==10==Where youth, and cost, witless bravery keeps.
==11==I have deliver’d to Lord Angelo
==12==(A man of stricture and firm abstinence) 
==13==My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
==14==And he supposes me travel’d to Poland
==15==(For so I have strew’d it in the common ear,
==16==And so it is receiv’d). Now, pious sir,
==17==You will demand of me why I do this.

**FRI. PET.**
==18==Gladly, my lord.

**DUKE.**
==19==We have strict statutes and most biting laws
==20==(The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds),
==21==Which for this fourteen years we have let slip,
==22==Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave,
==23==That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
==24==Having bound up the threat’ning twigs of birch,
==25==Only to stick it in their children’s sight
==26==For terror, not to use, in time the rod
==27==Becomes more mock’d than fear’d; so our decrees,
==28==Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,
==29==And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
==30==The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
==31==Goes all decorum.

**FRI. PET.**
==31==           It rested in your Grace
==32==To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas’d:
==33==And it in you more dreadful would have seem’d
==34==Than in Lord Angelo.

**DUKE.**
==34==           I do fear—too dreadful;
==35==Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,
==36==’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
==37==For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,
==38==When evil deeds have their permissive pass,
==39==And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
==40==I have on Angelo impos’d the office,
==41==Who may, in th’ ambush of my name, strike home,
==42==And yet my nature never in the fight
==43==To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
==44==I will, as ’twere a brother of your order,
==45==Visit both prince and people; therefore I prithee
==46==Supply me with the habit, and instruct me
==47==How I may formally in person bear
==48==Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
==49==At our more leisure shall I render you;
==50==Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
==51==Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
==52==That his blood flows; or that his appetite
==53==Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see
==54==If power change purpose: what our seemers be.

*Exeunt.*
