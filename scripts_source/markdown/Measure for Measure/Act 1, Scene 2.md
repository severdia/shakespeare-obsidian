## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Vienna. A street.*

*Enter Lucio and two other Gentlemen.*

**LUCIO.**
==1==If the Duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the King.

**1. GENT.**
==2==Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary’s!

**2. GENT.**
==3==Amen.

**LUCIO.**
==4==Thou conclud’st like the sanctimonious pirate, that went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrap’d one out of the table.

**2. GENT.**
==5==“Thou shalt not steal”?

**LUCIO.**
==6==Ay, that he raz’d.

**1. GENT.**
==7==Why, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions; they put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of us all, that in the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.

**2. GENT.**
==8==I never heard any soldier dislike it.

**LUCIO.**
==9==I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was said.

**2. GENT.**
==10==No? A dozen times at least.

**1. GENT.**
==11==What? In meter?

**LUCIO.**
==12==In any proportion, or in any language.

**1. GENT.**
==13==I think, or in any religion.

**LUCIO.**
==14==Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace.

**1. GENT.**
==15==Well; there went but a pair of shears between us.

**LUCIO.**
==16==I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet. Thou art the list.

**1. GENT.**
==17==And thou the velvet—thou art good velvet; thou’rt a three-pil’d piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be pil’d, as thou art pil’d, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?

**LUCIO.**
==18==I think thou dost; and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.

**1. GENT.**
==19==I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

**2. GENT.**
==20==Yes, that thou hast; whether thou art tainted or free.

*Enter bawd Mistress Overdone.*

**LUCIO.**
==21==Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes!

**1. GENT.**
==22==I have purchas’d as many diseases under her roof as come to⁠—

**2. GENT.**
==23==To what, I pray?

**LUCIO.**
==24==Judge.

**2. GENT.**
==25==To three thousand dolors a year.

**1. GENT.**
==26==Ay, and more.

**LUCIO.**
==27==A French crown more.

**1. GENT.**
==28==Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou art full of error, I am sound.

**LUCIO.**
==29==Nay, not (as one would say) healthy; but so sound as things that are hollow.
==30==Thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast of thee.

**1. GENT.**
==31==How now, which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?

**MIS. OV.**
==32==Well, well; there’s one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

**2. GENT.**
==33==Who’s that, I pray thee?

**MIS. OV.**
==34==Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, *Signior* Claudio.

**1. GENT.**
==35==Claudio to prison? ’Tis not so.

**MIS. OV.**
==36==Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested; saw him carried away; and which is more, within these three days his head to be chopp’d off.

**LUCIO.**
==37==But after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art thou sure of this?

**MIS. OV.**
==38==I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.

**LUCIO.**
==39==Believe me, this may be. He promis’d to meet me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.

**2. GENT.**
==40==Besides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose.

**1. GENT.**
==41==But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.

**LUCIO.**
==42==Away! Let’s go learn the truth of it.

*Exit with Gentlemen.*

**MIS. OV.**
==43==Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what with the gallows, and what with poverty, I am custom-shrunk.
*(Enter Clown Pompey.)*
==44==How now? What’s the news with you?

**POM.**
==45==Yonder man is carried to prison.

**MIS. OV.**
==46==Well; what has he done?

**POM.**
==47==A woman.

**MIS. OV.**
==48==But what’s his offense?

**POM.**
==49==Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

**MIS. OV.**
==50==What? Is there a maid with child by him?

**POM.**
==51==No; but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?

**MIS. OV.**
==52==What proclamation, man?

**POM.**
==53==All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck’d down.

**MIS. OV.**
==54==And what shall become of those in the city?

**POM.**
==55==They shall stand for seed. They had gone down too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.

**MIS. OV.**
==56==But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pull’d down?

**POM.**
==57==To the ground, mistress.

**MIS. OV.**
==58==Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth! What shall become of me?

**POM.**
==59==Come; fear not you; good counselors lack no clients. Though you change your place, you need not change your trade; I’ll be your tapster still. Courage! There will be pity taken on you. You that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will be consider’d.

**MIS. OV.**
==60==What’s to do here, Thomas tapster? Let’s withdraw.

**POM.**
==61==Here comes *Signior* Claudio, led by the Provost to prison; and there’s Madam Juliet.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Provost, Claudio, Juliet, Officers.*

**CLAUD.**
==62==Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to th’ world?
==63==Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

**PROV.**
==64==I do it not in evil disposition,
==65==But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

**CLAUD.**
==66==Thus can the demigod, Authority,
==67==Make us pay down for our offense by weight
==68==The words of heaven: on whom it will, it will;
==69==On whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just.

*Enter Lucio and two Gentlemen.*

**LUCIO.**
==70==Why, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this restraint?

**CLAUD.**
==71==From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
==72==As surfeit is the father of much fast,
==73==So every scope by the immoderate use
==74==Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
==75==Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
==76==A thirsty evil, and when we drink we die.

**LUCIO.**
==77==If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the mortality of imprisonment. What’s thy offense, Claudio?

**CLAUD.**
==78==What but to speak of would offend again.

**LUCIO.**
==79==What, is’t murder?

**CLAUD.**
==80==No.

**LUCIO.**
==81==Lechery?

**CLAUD.**
==82==Call it so.

**PROV.**
==83==Away, sir, you must go.

**CLAUD.**
==84==One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

**LUCIO.**
==85==A hundred! If they’ll do you any good.
==86==Is lechery so look’d after?

**CLAUD.**
==87==Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
==88==I got possession of Julietta’s bed.
==89==You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
==90==Save that we do the denunciation lack
==91==Of outward order. This we came not to,
==92==Only for propagation of a dow’r
==93==Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
==94==From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
==95==Till time had made them for us. But it chances
==96==The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
==97==With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

**LUCIO.**
==98==With child, perhaps?

**CLAUD.**
==98==           Unhappily, even so.
==99==And the new deputy now for the Duke⁠—
==100==Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
==101==Or whether that the body public be
==102==A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
==103==Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
==104==He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
==105==Whether the tyranny be in his place,
==106==Or in his eminence that fills it up,
==107==I stagger in—but this new governor
==108==Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
==109==Which have, like unscour’d armor, hung by th’ wall
==110==So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
==111==And none of them been worn; and for a name
==112==Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
==113==Freshly on me—’tis surely for a name.

**LUCIO.**
==114==I warrant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off. Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.

**CLAUD.**
==115==I have done so, but he’s not to be found.
==116==I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
==117==This day my sister should the cloister enter,
==118==And there receive her approbation.
==119==Acquaint her with the danger of my state;
==120==Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
==121==To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.
==122==I have great hope in that; for in her youth
==123==There is a prone and speechless dialect,
==124==Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
==125==When she will play with reason and discourse,
==126==And well she can persuade.

**LUCIO.**
==127==I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I’ll to her.

**CLAUD.**
==128==I thank you, good friend Lucio.

**LUCIO.**
==129==Within two hours.

**CLAUD.**
==129==           Come, officer, away!

*Exeunt.*
