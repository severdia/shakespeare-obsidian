## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*A street near the city gate.*

*Enter Isabella and Mariana.*

**ISAB.**
To speak so indirectly I am loath.
I would say the truth, but to accuse him so,
That is your part. Yet I am advis’d to do it,
He says, to veil full purpose.

**MAR.**
                Be rul’d by him.

**ISAB.**
Besides, he tells me that if peradventure
He speak against me on the adverse side,
I should not think it strange, for ’tis a physic
That’s bitter to sweet end.

*Enter Friar Peter.*

**MAR.**
I would Friar Peter⁠—

**ISAB.**
           O, peace, the friar is come.

**FRI. PET.**
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
Where you may have such vantage on the Duke,
He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The Duke is ent’ring; therefore hence away!

*Exeunt.*
