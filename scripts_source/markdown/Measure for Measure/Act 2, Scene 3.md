## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*A room in a prison.*

*Enter Duke disguised as a friar and Provost, meeting.*

**DUKE.**
==1== Hail to you, Provost! So I think you are.

**PROV.**
==2== I am the Provost. What’s your will, good friar?

**DUKE.**
==3== Bound by my charity and my blest order,
==4== I come to visit the afflicted spirits
==5== Here in the prison. Do me the common right
==6== To let me see them, and to make me know
==7== The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
==8== To them accordingly.

**PROV.**
==9== I would do more than that, if more were needful.
*(Enter Juliet.)*
==10== Look, here comes one; a gentlewoman of mine,
==11== Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
==12== Hath blister’d her report. She is with child,
==13== And he that got it, sentenc’d; a young man
==14== More fit to do another such offense
==15== Than die for this.

**DUKE.**
==16== When must he die?

**PROV.**
==16==            As I do think, tomorrow.
*(To Juliet.)*
==17== I have provided for you. Stay a while,
==18== And you shall be conducted.

**DUKE.**
==19== Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

**JUL.**
==20== I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

**DUKE.**
==21== I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
==22== And try your penitence, if it be sound,
==23== Or hollowly put on.

**JUL.**
==23==            I’ll gladly learn.

**DUKE.**
==24== Love you the man that wrong’d you?

**JUL.**
==25== Yes, as I love the woman that wrong’d him.

**DUKE.**
==26== So then it seems your most offenseful act
==27== Was mutually committed?

**JUL.**
==27==               Mutually.

**DUKE.**
==28== Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

**JUL.**
==29== I do confess it, and repent it, father.

**DUKE.**
==30== ’Tis meet so, daughter, but lest you do repent
==31== As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
==32== Which sorrow is always toward ourselves, not heaven,
==33== Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
==34== But as we stand in fear⁠—

**JUL.**
==35== I do repent me as it is an evil,
==36== And take the shame with joy.

**DUKE.**
==36==                 There rest.
==37== Your partner, as I hear, must die tomorrow,
==38== And I am going with instruction to him.
==39== Grace go with you, *Benedicite*!

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==40== Must die tomorrow? O injurious love,
==41== That respites me a life whose very comfort
==42== Is still a dying horror!

**PROV.**
==42==               ’Tis pity of him.

*Exeunt.*
