## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Vienna. An apartment in the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Duke, Escalus, Lords, and Attendants.*

**DUKE.**
==1==Escalus.

**ESCAL.**
==2==My lord.

**DUKE.**
==3==Of government the properties to unfold
==4==Would seem in me t’ affect speech and discourse,
==5==Since I am put to know that your own science
==6==Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
==7==My strength can give you. Then no more remains
==8==But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,
==9==And let them work. The nature of our people,
==10==Our city’s institutions, and the terms
==11==For common justice, y’ are as pregnant in
==12==As art and practice hath enriched any
==13==That we remember. There is our commission,
==14==From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
==15==I say, bid come before us Angelo.
*(Exit an Attendant.)*
==16==What figure of us think you he will bear?
==17==For you must know, we have with special soul
==18==Elected him our absence to supply,
==19==Lent him our terror, dress’d him with our love,
==20==And given his deputation all the organs
==21==Of our own pow’r. What think you of it?

**ESCAL.**
==22==If any in Vienna be of worth
==23==To undergo such ample grace and honor,
==24==It is Lord Angelo.

*Enter Angelo.*

**DUKE.**
==24==           Look where he comes.

**ANG.**
==25==Always obedient to your Grace’s will,
==26==I come to know your pleasure.

**DUKE.**
==26==                Angelo:
==27==There is a kind of character in thy life,
==28==That to th’ observer doth thy history
==29==Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
==30==Are not thine own so proper as to waste
==31==Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
==32==Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
==33==Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
==34==Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike
==35==As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch’d
==36==But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends
==37==The smallest scruple of her excellence,
==38==But like a thrifty goddess, she determines
==39==Herself the glory of a creditor,
==40==Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
==41==To one that can my part in him advertise.
==42==Hold therefore, Angelo:
==43==In our remove be thou at full ourself.
==44==Mortality and mercy in Vienna
==45==Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,
==46==Though first in question, is thy secondary.
==47==Take thy commission.

**ANG.**
==47==           Now, good my lord,
==48==Let there be some more test made of my mettle
==49==Before so noble and so great a figure
==50==Be stamp’d upon it.

**DUKE.**
==50==           No more evasion.
==51==We have with a leaven’d and prepared choice
==52==Proceeded to you; therefore take your honors.
==53==Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
==54==That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion’d
==55==Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
==56==As time and our concernings shall importune,
==57==How it goes with us, and do look to know
==58==What doth befall you here. So fare you well.
==59==To th’ hopeful execution do I leave you
==60==Of your commissions.

**ANG.**
==60==           Yet give leave, my lord,
==61==That we may bring you something on the way.

**DUKE.**
==62==My haste may not admit it,
==63==Nor need you (on mine honor) have to do
==64==With any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,
==65==So to enforce or qualify the laws
==66==As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand,
==67==I’ll privily away. I love the people,
==68==But do not like to stage me to their eyes;
==69==Though it do well, I do not relish well
==70==Their loud applause and aves vehement;
==71==Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
==72==That does affect it. Once more fare you well.

**ANG.**
==73==The heavens give safety to your purposes!

**ESCAL.**
==74==Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

**DUKE.**
==75==I thank you. Fare you well.

*Exit.*

**ESCAL.**
==76==I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
==77==To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
==78==To look into the bottom of my place.
==79==A pow’r I have, but of what strength and nature
==80==I am not yet instructed.

**ANG.**
==81==’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
==82==And we may soon our satisfaction have
==83==Touching that point.

**ESCAL.**
==83==           I’ll wait upon your honor.

*Exeunt.*
