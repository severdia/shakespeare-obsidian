## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*A room in Angelo’s house.*

*Enter Angelo.*

**ANG.**
==1==When I would pray and think, I think and pray
==2==To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words,
==3==Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
==4==Anchors on Isabel; heaven in my mouth,
==5==As if I did but only chew his name,
==6==And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
==7==Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied,
==8==Is like a good thing, being often read,
==9==Grown sere and tedious; yea, my gravity,
==10==Wherein (let no man hear me) I take pride,
==11==Could I, with boot, change for an idle plume,
==12==Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
==13==How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
==14==Wrench awe from fools, and tie the wiser souls
==15==To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood.
==16==Let’s write “good angel” on the devil’s horn,
==17==’Tis not the devil’s crest.
*(Enter Servant.)*
==17==              How now? Who’s there?

**SERV.**
==18==One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

**ANG.**
==19==Teach her the way.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==19==           O heavens!
==20==Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
==21==Making both it unable for itself,
==22==And dispossessing all my other parts
==23==Of necessary fitness?
==24==So play the foolish throngs with one that swounds,
==25==Come all to help him, and so stop the air
==26==By which he should revive; and even so
==27==The general subject to a well-wish’d king
==28==Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
==29==Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
==30==Must needs appear offense.
*(Enter Isabella.)*
==30==                How now, fair maid?

**ISAB.**
==31==I am come to know your pleasure.

**ANG.**
==32==That you might know it, would much better please me
==33==Than to demand what ’tis. Your brother cannot live.

**ISAB.**
==34==Even so. Heaven keep your honor!

**ANG.**
==35==Yet may he live a while; and it may be
==36==As long as you or I. Yet he must die.

**ISAB.**
==37==Under your sentence?

**ANG.**
==38==Yea.

**ISAB.**
==39==When, I beseech you? That in his reprieve,
==40==Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
==41==That his soul sicken not.

**ANG.**
==42==Ha? Fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
==43==To pardon him that hath from nature stol’n
==44==A man already made, as to remit
==45==Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven’s image
==46==In stamps that are forbid. ’Tis all as easy
==47==Falsely to take away a life true made
==48==As to put metal in restrained means
==49==To make a false one.

**ISAB.**
==50==’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

**ANG.**
==51==Say you so? Then I shall pose you quickly.
==52==Which had you rather, that the most just law
==53==Now took your brother’s life, or, to redeem him,
==54==Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
==55==As she that he hath stain’d?

**ISAB.**
==55==              Sir, believe this,
==56==I had rather give my body than my soul.

**ANG.**
==57==I talk not of your soul; our compell’d sins
==58==Stand more for number than for accompt.

**ISAB.**
==58==                     How say you?

**ANG.**
==59==Nay, I’ll not warrant that; for I can speak
==60==Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
==61==I (now the voice of the recorded law) 
==62==Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life;
==63==Might there not be a charity in sin
==64==To save this brother’s life?

**ISAB.**
==64==              Please you to do’t,
==65==I’ll take it as a peril to my soul,
==66==It is no sin at all, but charity.

**ANG.**
==67==Pleas’d you to do’t at peril of your soul,
==68==Were equal poise of sin and charity.

**ISAB.**
==69==That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
==70==Heaven let me bear it! You granting of my suit,
==71==If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn-prayer
==72==To have it added to the faults of mine,
==73==And nothing of your answer.

**ANG.**
==73==                Nay, but hear me,
==74==Your sense pursues not mine. Either you are ignorant,
==75==Or seem so craftily; and that’s not good.

**ISAB.**
==76==Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
==77==But graciously to know I am no better.

**ANG.**
==78==Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
==79==When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
==80==Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
==81==Than beauty could, displayed. But mark me:
==82==To be received plain, I’ll speak more gross:
==83==Your brother is to die.

**ISAB.**
==84==So.

**ANG.**
==85==And his offense is so, as it appears,
==86==Accountant to the law upon that pain.

**ISAB.**
==87==True.

**ANG.**
==88==Admit no other way to save his life
==89==(As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
==90==But in the loss of question), that you, his sister,
==91==Finding yourself desir’d of such a person,
==92==Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
==93==Could fetch your brother from the manacles
==94==Of the all-binding law; and that there were
==95==No earthly mean to save him, but that either
==96==You must lay down the treasures of your body
==97==To this supposed, or else to let him suffer⁠—
==98==What would you do?

**ISAB.**
==99==As much for my poor brother as myself:
==100==That is, were I under the terms of death,
==101==Th’ impression of keen whips I’ld wear as rubies,
==102==And strip myself to death, as to a bed
==103==That longing have been sick for, ere I’ld yield
==104==My body up to shame.

**ANG.**
==104==           Then must your brother die.

**ISAB.**
==105==And ’twere the cheaper way:
==106==Better it were a brother died at once,
==107==Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
==108==Should die forever.

**ANG.**
==109==Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
==110==That you have slander’d so?

**ISAB.**
==111==Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
==112==Are of two houses: lawful mercy
==113==Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

**ANG.**
==114==You seem’d of late to make the law a tyrant,
==115==And rather prov’d the sliding of your brother
==116==A merriment than a vice.

**ISAB.**
==117==O, pardon me, my lord, it oft falls out,
==118==To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean.
==119==I something do excuse the thing I hate,
==120==For his advantage that I dearly love.

**ANG.**
==121==We are all frail.

**ISAB.**
==121==        Else let my brother die,
==122==If not a fedary, but only he,
==123==Owe and succeed thy weakness.

**ANG.**
==124==Nay, women are frail too.

**ISAB.**
==125==Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,
==126==Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
==127==Women? Help heaven! Men their creation mar
==128==In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail,
==129==For we are soft as our complexions are,
==130==And credulous to false prints.

**ANG.**
==130==                I think it well;
==131==And from this testimony of your own sex
==132==(Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
==133==Than faults may shake our frames), let me be bold.
==134==I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
==135==That is a woman; if you be more, you’re none;
==136==If you be one (as you are well express’d
==137==By all external warrants), show it now,
==138==By putting on the destin’d livery.

**ISAB.**
==139==I have no tongue but one; gentle my lord,
==140==Let me entreat you speak the former language.

**ANG.**
==141==Plainly conceive, I love you.

**ISAB.**
==142==My brother did love Juliet,
==143==And you tell me that he shall die for’t.

**ANG.**
==144==He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

**ISAB.**
==145==I know your virtue hath a license in’t,
==146==Which seems a little fouler than it is,
==147==To pluck on others.

**ANG.**
==147==           Believe me, on mine honor,
==148==My words express my purpose.

**ISAB.**
==149==Ha? Little honor to be much believ’d,
==150==And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
==151==I will proclaim thee, Angelo, look for’t!
==152==Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
==153==Or with an outstretch’d throat I’ll tell the world aloud
==154==What man thou art.

**ANG.**
==154==           Who will believe thee, Isabel?
==155==My unsoil’d name, th’ austereness of my life,
==156==My vouch against you, and my place i’ th’ state,
==157==Will so your accusation overweigh,
==158==That you shall stifle in your own report,
==159==And smell of calumny. I have begun,
==160==And now I give my sensual race the rein.
==161==Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite,
==162==Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
==163==That banish what they sue for. Redeem thy brother
==164==By yielding up thy body to my will,
==165==Or else he must not only die the death,
==166==But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
==167==To ling’ring sufferance. Answer me tomorrow,
==168==Or by the affection that now guides me most,
==169==I’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
==170==Say what you can: my false o’erweighs your true.

*Exit.*

**ISAB.**
==171==To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
==172==Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
==173==That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
==174==Either of condemnation or approof,
==175==Bidding the law make curtsy to their will,
==176==Hooking both right and wrong to th’ appetite,
==177==To follow as it draws! I’ll to my brother.
==178==Though he hath fall’n by prompture of the blood,
==179==Yet hath he in him such a mind of honor
==180==That had he twenty heads to tender down
==181==On twenty bloody blocks, he’ld yield them up,
==182==Before his sister should her body stoop
==183==To such abhorr’d pollution.
==184==Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die;
==185==More than our brother is our chastity.
==186==I’ll tell him yet of Angelo’s request,
==187==And fit his mind to death, for his soul’s rest.

*Exit.*
