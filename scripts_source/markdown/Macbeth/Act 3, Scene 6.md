## Act 3, Scene 6
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Forres. The palace.*

*Enter Lennox and another Lord.*

**LEN.**
==1==My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
==2==Which can interpret farther; only I say
==3==Things have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
==4==Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.
==5==And the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late,
==6==Whom you may say (if’t please you) Fleance kill’d,
==7==For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.
==8==Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
==9==It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
==10==To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!
==11==How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight
==12==In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
==13==That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
==14==Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
==15==For ’twould have anger’d any heart alive
==16==To hear the men deny’t. So that, I say,
==17==He has borne all things well, and I do think
==18==That had he Duncan’s sons under his key
==19==(As, and’t please heaven, he shall not), they should find
==20==What ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
==21==But peace! For from broad words, and ’cause he fail’d
==22==His presence at the tyrant’s feast, I hear
==23==Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
==24==Where he bestows himself?

**LORD.**
==24==              The son of Duncan
==25==(From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth) 
==26==Lives in the English court, and is receiv’d
==27==Of the most pious Edward with such grace
==28==That the malevolence of fortune nothing
==29==Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff
==30==Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
==31==To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward,
==32==That by the help of these (with Him above
==33==To ratify the work) we may again
==34==Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;
==35==Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives;
==36==Do faithful homage and receive free honors;
==37==All which we pine for now. And this report
==38==Hath so exasperate the King that he
==39==Prepares for some attempt of war.

**LEN.**
==39==                  Sent he to Macduff?

**LORD.**
==40==He did; and with an absolute “Sir, not I,”
==41==The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
==42==And hums, as who should say, “You’ll rue the time
==43==That clogs me with this answer.”

**LEN.**
==43==                  And that well might
==44==Advise him to a caution, t’ hold what distance
==45==His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
==46==Fly to the court of England, and unfold
==47==His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
==48==May soon return to this our suffering country
==49==Under a hand accurs’d!

**LORD.**
==49==              I’ll send my prayers with him.

*Exeunt.*
