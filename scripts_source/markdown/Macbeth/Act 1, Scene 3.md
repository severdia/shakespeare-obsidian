## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*A heath near Forres.*

*Thunder. Enter the three Witches.*

**1. WITCH.**
==1==Where hast thou been, sister?

**2. WITCH.**
==2==Killing swine.

**3. WITCH.**
==3==Sister, where thou?

**1. WITCH.**
==4==A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap,
==5==And mounch’d, and mounch’d, and mounch’d. “Give me!” quoth I.
==6==“Aroint thee, witch!” the rump-fed ronyon cries.
==7==Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ th’ Tiger;
==8==But in a sieve I’ll thither sail,
==9==And like a rat without a tail,
==10==I’ll do, I’ll do, and I’ll do.

**2. WITCH.**
==11==I’ll give thee a wind.

**1. WITCH.**
==12==Th’ art kind.

**3. WITCH.**
==13==And I another.

**1. WITCH.**
==14==I myself have all the other,
==15==And the very ports they blow,
==16==All the quarters that they know
==17==I’ th’ shipman’s card.
==18==I’ll drain him dry as hay:
==19==Sleep shall neither night nor day
==20==Hang upon his penthouse lid;
==21==He shall live a man forbid;
==22==Weary sev’nnights, nine times nine,
==23==Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine;
==24==Though his bark cannot be lost,
==25==Yet it shall be tempest-toss’d.
==26==Look what I have.

**2. WITCH.**
==27==Show me, show me.

**1. WITCH.**
==28==Here I have a pilot’s thumb,
==29==Wrack’d as homeward he did come.

*Drum within.*

**3. WITCH.**
==30==A drum, a drum!
==31==Macbeth doth come.

**THREE WITCHES**
==32==The weird sisters, hand in hand,
==33==Posters of the sea and land,
==34==Thus do go, about, about,
==35==Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
==36==And thrice again, to make up nine.
==37==Peace, the charm’s wound up.

*Enter Macbeth and Banquo.*

**MACB.**
==38==So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

**BAN.**
==39==How far is’t call’d to Forres? What are these
==40==So wither’d and so wild in their attire,
==41==That look not like th’ inhabitants o’ th’ earth,
==42==And yet are on’t? Live you? Or are you aught
==43==That man may question? You seem to understand me,
==44==By each at once her choppy finger laying
==45==Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,
==46==And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
==47==That you are so.

**MACB.**
==47==        Speak, if you can: what are you?

**1. WITCH.**
==48==All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!

**2. WITCH.**
==49==All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee. Thane of Cawdor!

**3. WITCH.**
==50==All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!

**BAN.**
==51==Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear
==52==Things that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truth,
==53==Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
==54==Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
==55==You greet with present grace, and great prediction
==56==Of noble having and of royal hope,
==57==That he seems rapt withal; to me you speak not.
==58==If you can look into the seeds of time,
==59==And say which grain will grow, and which will not,
==60==Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
==61==Your favors nor your hate.

**1. WITCH.**
==62==Hail!

**2. WITCH.**
==63==Hail!

**3. WITCH.**
==64==Hail!

**1. WITCH.**
==65==Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

**2. WITCH.**
==66==Not so happy, yet much happier.

**3. WITCH.**
==67==Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.
==68==So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

**1. WITCH.**
==69==Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

**MACB.**
==70==Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
==71==By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis,
==72==But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives
==73==A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
==74==Stands not within the prospect of belief,
==75==No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
==76==You owe this strange intelligence, or why
==77==Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
==78==With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

*Witches vanish.*

**BAN.**
==79==The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
==80==And these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d?

**MACB.**
==81==Into the air; and what seem’d corporal melted,
==82==As breath into the wind. Would they had stay’d!

**BAN.**
==83==Were such things here as we do speak about?
==84==Or have we eaten on the insane root
==85==That takes the reason prisoner?

**MACB.**
==86==Your children shall be kings.

**BAN.**
==86==                You shall be king.

**MACB.**
==87==And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?

**BAN.**
==88==To th’ self-same tune and words. Who’s here?

*Enter Rosse and Angus.*

**ROSSE.**
==89==The King hath happily receiv’d, Macbeth,
==90==The news of thy success; and when he reads
==91==Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight,
==92==His wonders and his praises do contend
==93==Which should be thine or his. Silenc’d with that,
==94==In viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ self-same day,
==95==He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
==96==Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
==97==Strange images of death. As thick as tale
==98==Came post with post, and every one did bear
==99==Thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense,
==100==And pour’d them down before him.

**ANG.**
==100==                  We are sent
==101==To give thee from our royal master thanks,
==102==Only to herald thee into his sight,
==103==Not pay thee.

**ROSSE.**
==104==And for an earnest of a greater honor,
==105==He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor;
==106==In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,
==107==For it is thine.

**BAN.**
==107==        What, can the devil speak true?

**MACB.**
==108==The Thane of Cawdor lives; why do you dress me
==109==In borrowed robes?

**ANG.**
==109==           Who was the thane lives yet,
==110==But under heavy judgment bears that life
==111==Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin’d
==112==With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
==113==With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
==114==He labor’d in his country’s wrack, I know not;
==115==But treasons capital, confess’d and prov’d,
==116==Have overthrown him.

**MACB.**
*(Aside.)*
==116==           Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!
==117==The greatest is behind.
*(To Rosse and Angus.)*
==117==              Thanks for your pains.
*(Aside to Banquo.)*
==118==Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
==119==When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
==120==Promis’d no less to them?

**BAN.**
*(Aside to Macbeth)*
==120==              That, trusted home,
==121==Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
==122==Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange;
==123==And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
==124==The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
==125==Win us with honest trifles, to betray ’s
==126==In deepest consequence.⁠—
==127==Cousins, a word, I pray you.

**MACB.**
*(Aside.)*
==127==                Two truths are told,
==128==As happy prologues to the swelling act
==129==Of the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.
*(Aside.)*
==130==This supernatural soliciting
==131==Cannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,
==132==Why hath it given me earnest of success,
==133==Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
==134==If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
==135==Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
==136==And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
==137==Against the use of nature? Present fears
==138==Are less than horrible imaginings:
==139==My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
==140==Shakes so my single state of man that function
==141==Is smother’d in surmise, and nothing is
==142==But what is not.

**BAN.**
==142==        Look how our partner’s rapt.

**MACB.**
*(Aside.)*
==143==If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me
==144==Without my stir.

**BAN.**
==144==        New honors come upon him,
==145==Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mold
==146==But with the aid of use.

**MACB.**
*(Aside.)*
==146==              Come what come may,
==147==Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

**BAN.**
==148==Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

**MACB.**
==149==Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought
==150==With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
==151==Are regist’red where every day I turn
==152==The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.
*(Aside to Banquo.)*
==153==Think upon what hath chanc’d; and at more time,
==154==The interim having weigh’d it, let us speak
==155==Our free hearts each to other.

**BAN.**
==155==                Very gladly.

**MACB.**
==156==Till then, enough.—Come, friends.

*Exeunt.*
