## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 1, Scene 5|Act 1, Scene 5 →]]

*Forres. A room in the palace.*

*Flourish. Enter King Duncan, Lennox, Malcolm, Donalbain, and Attendants.*

**DUN.**
==1== Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
==2== Those in commission yet return’d?

**MAL.**
==2==                   My liege,
==3== They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
==4== With one that saw him die; who did report
==5== That very frankly he confess’d his treasons,
==6== Implor’d your Highness’ pardon, and set forth
==7== A deep repentance. Nothing in his life
==8== Became him like the leaving it. He died
==9== As one that had been studied in his death,
==10== To throw away the dearest thing he ow’d,
==11== As ’twere a careless trifle.

**DUN.**
==11==               There’s no art
==12== To find the mind’s construction in the face:
==13== He was a gentleman on whom I built
==14== An absolute trust.
*(Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.)*
==14==            O worthiest cousin!
==15== The sin of my ingratitude even now
==16== Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,
==17== That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
==18== To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv’d,
==19== That the proportion both of thanks and payment
==20== Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,
==21== More is thy due than more than all can pay.

**MACB.**
==22== The service and the loyalty I owe,
==23== In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness’ part
==24== Is to receive our duties; and our duties
==25== Are to your throne and state children and servants;
==26== Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
==27== Safe toward your love and honor.

**DUN.**
==27==                   Welcome hither!
==28== I have begun to plant thee, and will labor
==29== To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
==30== That hast no less deserv’d, nor must be known
==31== No less to have done so, let me infold thee
==32== And hold thee to my heart.

**BAN.**
==32==               There if I grow,
==33== The harvest is your own.

**DUN.**
==33==               My plenteous joys,
==34== Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves
==35== In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
==36== And you whose places are the nearest, know
==37== We will establish our estate upon
==38== Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
==39== The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must
==40== Not unaccompanied invest him only,
==41== But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
==42== On all deservers. From hence to Enverness,
==43== And bind us further to you.

**MACB.**
==44== The rest is labor, which is not us’d for you.
==45== I’ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful
==46== The hearing of my wife with your approach;
==47== So humbly take my leave.

**DUN.**
==47==               My worthy Cawdor!

**MACB.**
*(Aside.)*
==48== The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step
==49== On which I must fall down, or else o’erleap,
==50== For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires,
==51== Let not light see my black and deep desires;
==52== The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be
==53== Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

*Exit.*

**DUN.**
==54== True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant,
==55== And in his commendations I am fed;
==56== It is a banquet to me. Let’s after him,
==57== Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
==58== It is a peerless kinsman.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
