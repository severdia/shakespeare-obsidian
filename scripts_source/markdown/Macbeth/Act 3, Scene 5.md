## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 6|Act 3, Scene 6 →]]

*A heath.*

*Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.*

**1. WITCH.**
Why, how now, Hecat? You look angerly.

**HEC.**
Have I not reason, beldams as you are?
Saucy and overbold, how did you dare
To trade and traffic with Macbeth
In riddles and affairs of death;
And I, the mistress of your charms,
The close contriver of all harms,
Was never call’d to bear my part,
Or show the glory of our art?
And which is worse, all you have done
Hath been but for a wayward son,
Spiteful and wrathful, who (as others do) 
Loves for his own ends, not for you.
But make amends now. Get you gone,
And at the pit of Acheron
Meet me i’ th’ morning; thither he
Will come to know his destiny.
Your vessels and your spells provide,
Your charms and every thing beside.
I am for th’ air; this night I’ll spend
Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
Great business must be wrought ere noon:
Upon the corner of the moon
There hangs a vap’rous drop profound,
I’ll catch it ere it come to ground;
And that, distill’d by magic sleights,
Shall raise such artificial sprites
As by the strength of their illusion
Shall draw him on to his confusion.
He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear;
And you all know, security
Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.
*(Music, and a song. Sing within:)*
*“Come away, come away, etc.”*
*Hark, I am call’d; my little spirit, see,*
*Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.*

*Exit.*

**1. WITCH.**
Come, let’s make haste, she’ll soon be back again.

*Exeunt.*
