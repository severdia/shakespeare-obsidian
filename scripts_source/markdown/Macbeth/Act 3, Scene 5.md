## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 6|Act 3, Scene 6 →]]

*A heath.*

*Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.*

**1. WITCH.**
==1==Why, how now, Hecat? You look angerly.

**HEC.**
==2==Have I not reason, beldams as you are?
==3==Saucy and overbold, how did you dare
==4==To trade and traffic with Macbeth
==5==In riddles and affairs of death;
==6==And I, the mistress of your charms,
==7==The close contriver of all harms,
==8==Was never call’d to bear my part,
==9==Or show the glory of our art?
==10==And which is worse, all you have done
==11==Hath been but for a wayward son,
==12==Spiteful and wrathful, who (as others do) 
==13==Loves for his own ends, not for you.
==14==But make amends now. Get you gone,
==15==And at the pit of Acheron
==16==Meet me i’ th’ morning; thither he
==17==Will come to know his destiny.
==18==Your vessels and your spells provide,
==19==Your charms and every thing beside.
==20==I am for th’ air; this night I’ll spend
==21==Unto a dismal and a fatal end.
==22==Great business must be wrought ere noon:
==23==Upon the corner of the moon
==24==There hangs a vap’rous drop profound,
==25==I’ll catch it ere it come to ground;
==26==And that, distill’d by magic sleights,
==27==Shall raise such artificial sprites
==28==As by the strength of their illusion
==29==Shall draw him on to his confusion.
==30==He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
==31==His hopes ’bove wisdom, grace, and fear;
==32==And you all know, security
==33==Is mortals’ chiefest enemy.
*(Music, and a song. Sing within:)*
==34==*“Come away, come away, etc.”*
==35==*Hark, I am call’d; my little spirit, see,*
==36==*Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.*

*Exit.*

**1. WITCH.**
==37==Come, let’s make haste, she’ll soon be back again.

*Exeunt.*
