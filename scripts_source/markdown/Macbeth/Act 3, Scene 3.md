## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Forres. A park near the palace.*

*Enter three Murderers.*

**1. MUR.**
But who did bid thee join with us?

**3. MUR.**
                  Macbeth.

**2. MUR.**
He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices, and what we have to do,
To the direction just.

**1. MUR.**
           Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;
Now spurs the lated traveler apace
To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
The subject of our watch.

**3. MUR.**
              Hark, I hear horses.

**BAN.**
*(Within.)*
Give us a light there, ho!

**2. MUR.**
              Then ’tis he; the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i’ th’ court.

**1. MUR.**
              His horses go about.

**3. MUR.**
Almost a mile; but he does usually,
So all men do, from hence to th’ palace gate
Make it their walk.

*Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch.*

**2. MUR.**
           A light, a light!

**3. MUR.**
                     ’Tis he.

**1. MUR.**
Stand to’t.

**BAN.**
It will be rain tonight.

**1. MUR.**
              Let it come down.

*They assault Banquo.*

**BAN.**
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

*Dies.*

*Fleance escapes.*

**3. MUR.**
Who did strike out the light?

**1. MUR.**
                Was’t not the way?

**3. MUR.**
There’s but one down; the son is fled.

**2. MUR.**
                     We have lost
Best half of our affair.

**1. MUR.**
Well, let’s away, and say how much is done.

*Exeunt.*
