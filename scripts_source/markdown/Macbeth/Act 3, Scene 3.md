## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Forres. A park near the palace.*

*Enter three Murderers.*

**1. MUR.**
==1==But who did bid thee join with us?

**3. MUR.**
==1==                  Macbeth.

**2. MUR.**
==2==He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
==3==Our offices, and what we have to do,
==4==To the direction just.

**1. MUR.**
==4==           Then stand with us.
==5==The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;
==6==Now spurs the lated traveler apace
==7==To gain the timely inn, and near approaches
==8==The subject of our watch.

**3. MUR.**
==8==              Hark, I hear horses.

**BAN.**
*(Within.)*
==9==Give us a light there, ho!

**2. MUR.**
==9==              Then ’tis he; the rest
==10==That are within the note of expectation
==11==Already are i’ th’ court.

**1. MUR.**
==11==              His horses go about.

**3. MUR.**
==12==Almost a mile; but he does usually,
==13==So all men do, from hence to th’ palace gate
==14==Make it their walk.

*Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch.*

**2. MUR.**
==14==           A light, a light!

**3. MUR.**
==14==                     ’Tis he.

**1. MUR.**
==15==Stand to’t.

**BAN.**
==16==It will be rain tonight.

**1. MUR.**
==16==              Let it come down.

*They assault Banquo.*

**BAN.**
==17==O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
==18==Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

*Dies.*

*Fleance escapes.*

**3. MUR.**
==19==Who did strike out the light?

**1. MUR.**
==19==                Was’t not the way?

**3. MUR.**
==20==There’s but one down; the son is fled.

**2. MUR.**
==20==                     We have lost
==21==Best half of our affair.

**1. MUR.**
==22==Well, let’s away, and say how much is done.

*Exeunt.*
