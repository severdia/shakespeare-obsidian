## Act 1, Scene 6
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 1, Scene 7|Act 1, Scene 7 →]]

*Before Macbeth’s castle.*

*Hoboys and torches. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Rosse, Angus, and Attendants.*

**DUN.**
==1==This castle hath a pleasant seat, the air
==2==Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
==3==Unto our gentle senses.

**BAN.**
==3==              This guest of summer,
==4==The temple-haunting marlet, does approve,
==5==By his lov’d mansionry, that the heaven’s breath
==6==Smells wooingly here; no jutty, frieze,
==7==Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
==8==Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
==9==Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ’d
==10==The air is delicate.

*Enter Lady Macbeth.*

**DUN.**
==10==           See, see, our honor’d hostess!
==11==The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
==12==Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
==13==How you shall bid God ’ield us for your pains,
==14==And thank us for your trouble.

**L. MACB.**
==14==                All our service
==15==In every point twice done, and then done double,
==16==Were poor and single business to contend
==17==Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
==18==Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,
==19==And the late dignities heap’d up to them,
==20==We rest your ermites.

**DUN.**
==20==           Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?
==21==We cours’d him at the heels, and had a purpose
==22==To be his purveyor; but he rides well,
==23==And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath help him
==24==To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
==25==We are your guest tonight.

**L. MACB.**
==25==              Your servants ever
==26==Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,
==27==To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure,
==28==Still to return your own.

**DUN.**
==28==              Give me your hand.
==29==Conduct me to mine host, we love him highly,
==30==And shall continue our graces towards him.
==31==By your leave, hostess.

*Exeunt.*
