## Act 1, Scene 6
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 1, Scene 7|Act 1, Scene 7 →]]

*Before Macbeth’s castle.*

*Hoboys and torches. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Rosse, Angus, and Attendants.*

**DUN.**
This castle hath a pleasant seat, the air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses.

**BAN.**
              This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting marlet, does approve,
By his lov’d mansionry, that the heaven’s breath
Smells wooingly here; no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observ’d
The air is delicate.

*Enter Lady Macbeth.*

**DUN.**
           See, see, our honor’d hostess!
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
How you shall bid God ’ield us for your pains,
And thank us for your trouble.

**L. MACB.**
                All our service
In every point twice done, and then done double,
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,
And the late dignities heap’d up to them,
We rest your ermites.

**DUN.**
           Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?
We cours’d him at the heels, and had a purpose
To be his purveyor; but he rides well,
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath help him
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
We are your guest tonight.

**L. MACB.**
              Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,
To make their audit at your Highness’ pleasure,
Still to return your own.

**DUN.**
              Give me your hand.
Conduct me to mine host, we love him highly,
And shall continue our graces towards him.
By your leave, hostess.

*Exeunt.*
