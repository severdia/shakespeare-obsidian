## Act 1, Scene 7
[[Act 1, Scene 6|← Act 1, Scene 6]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*A room in Macbeth’s castle.*

*Hoboys, torches. Enter a Sewer and diverse Servants with dishes and service over the stage. Then enter Macbeth.*

**MACB.**
==1== If it were done, when ’tis done, then ’twere well
==2== It were done quickly. If th’ assassination
==3== Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
==4== With his surcease, success; that but this blow
==5== Might be the be-all and the end-all—here,
==6== But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
==7== We’ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
==8== We still have judgment here, that we but teach
==9== Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
==10== To plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justice
==11== Commends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chalice
==12== To our own lips. He’s here in double trust:
==13== First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
==14== Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
==15== Who should against his murderer shut the door,
==16== Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
==17== Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
==18== So clear in his great office, that his virtues
==19== Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongu’d, against
==20== The deep damnation of his taking-off;
==21== And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
==22== Striding the blast, or heaven’s cherubin, hors’d
==23== Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
==24== Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
==25== That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
==26== To prick the sides of my intent, but only
==27== Vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself,
==28== And falls on th’ other⁠—
*(Enter Lady Macbeth.)*
==28==               How now? What news?

**L. MACB.**
==29== He has almost supp’d. Why have you left the chamber?

**MACB.**
==30== Hath he ask’d for me?

**L. MACB.**
==30==            Know you not he has?

**MACB.**
==31== We will proceed no further in this business:
==32== He hath honor’d me of late, and I have bought
==33== Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
==34== Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
==35== Not cast aside so soon.

**L. MACB.**
==35==               Was the hope drunk
==36== Wherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since?
==37== And wakes it now to look so green and pale
==38== At what it did so freely? From this time
==39== Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
==40== To be the same in thine own act and valor
==41== As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
==42== Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life,
==43== And live a coward in thine own esteem,
==44== Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would,”
==45== Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage?

**MACB.**
==45==                 Prithee peace!
==46== I dare do all that may become a man;
==47== Who dares do more is none.

**L. MACB.**
==47==                 What beast was’t then
==48== That made you break this enterprise to me?
==49== When you durst do it, then you were a man;
==50== And to be more than what you were, you would
==51== Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place,
==52== Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
==53== They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
==54== Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
==55== How tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me;
==56== I would, while it was smiling in my face,
==57== Have pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gums,
==58== And dash’d the brains out, had I so sworn as you
==59== Have done to this.

**MACB.**
==59==            If we should fail?

**L. MACB.**
==59==                      We fail?
==60== But screw your courage to the sticking place,
==61== And we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep
==62== (Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey
==63== Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains
==64== Will I with wine and wassail so convince,
==65== That memory, the warder of the brain,
==66== Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
==67== A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep
==68== Their drenched natures lies as in a death,
==69== What cannot you and I perform upon
==70== Th’ unguarded Duncan? What not put upon
==71== His spungy officers, who shall bear the guilt
==72== Of our great quell?

**MACB.**
==72==            Bring forth men-children only!
==73== For thy undaunted mettle should compose
==74== Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv’d,
==75== When we have mark’d with blood those sleepy two
==76== Of his own chamber, and us’d their very daggers,
==77== That they have done’t?

**L. MACB.**
==77==            Who dares receive it other,
==78== As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
==79== Upon his death?

**MACB.**
==79==            I am settled, and bend up
==80== Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
==81== Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
==82== False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

*Exeunt.*
