## Act 5, Scene 6
[[Act 5, Scene 5|← Act 5, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 7|Act 5, Scene 7 →]]

*Dunsinane. Before the castle.*

*Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff, and their army, with boughs.*

**MAL.**
Now near enough; your leavy screens throw down,
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,
Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon ’s what else remains to do,
According to our order.

**SIW.**
              Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonight,
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.

**MACD.**
Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

*Exeunt. Alarums continued.*
