## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The country near Dunsinane.*

*Drum and Colors. Enter Menteth, Cathness, Angus, Lennox, Soldiers.*

**MENT.**
==1== The English pow’r is near, led on by Malcolm,
==2== His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.
==3== Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
==4== Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
==5== Excite the mortified man.

**ANG.**
==5==               Near Birnan wood
==6== Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.

**CATH.**
==7== Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

**LEN.**
==8== For certain, sir, he is not; I have a file
==9== Of all the gentry. There is Siward’s son,
==10== And many unrough youths that even now
==11== Protest their first of manhood.

**MENT.**
==11==                 What does the tyrant?

**CATH.**
==12== Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.
==13== Some say he’s mad; others that lesser hate him
==14== Do call it valiant fury; but for certain
==15== He cannot buckle his distemper’d cause
==16== Within the belt of rule.

**ANG.**
==16==               Now does he feel
==17== His secret murders sticking on his hands;
==18== Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
==19== Those he commands move only in command,
==20== Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title
==21== Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe
==22== Upon a dwarfish thief.

**MENT.**
==22==            Who then shall blame
==23== His pester’d senses to recoil and start,
==24== When all that is within him does condemn
==25== Itself for being there?

**CATH.**
==25==            Well, march we on
==26== To give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d.
==27== Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal,
==28== And with him pour we, in our country’s purge,
==29== Each drop of us.

**LEN.**
==29==         Or so much as it needs
==30== To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
==31== Make we our march towards Birnan.

*Exeunt marching.*
