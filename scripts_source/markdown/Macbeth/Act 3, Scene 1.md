## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Forres. The palace.*

*Enter Banquo.*

**BAN.**
==1== Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
==2== As the weird women promis’d, and I fear
==3== Thou play’dst most foully for’t; yet it was said
==4== It should not stand in thy posterity,
==5== But that myself should be the root and father
==6== Of many kings. If there come truth from them⁠—
==7== As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine⁠—
==8== Why, by the verities on thee made good,
==9== May they not be my oracles as well,
==10== And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.

*Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth as Queen, Lennox, Rosse, Lords, and Attendants.*

**K. MACB.**
==11== Here’s our chief guest.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==11==            If he had been forgotten,
==12== It had been as a gap in our great feast,
==13== And all-thing unbecoming.

**K. MACB.**
==14== Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir,
==15== And I’ll request your presence.

**BAN.**
==15==                 Let your Highness
==16== Command upon me, to the which my duties
==17== Are with a most indissoluble tie
==18== Forever knit.

**K. MACB.**
==19== Ride you this afternoon?

**BAN.**
==19==               Ay, my good lord.

**K. MACB.**
==20== We should have else desir’d your good advice
==21== (Which still hath been both grave and prosperous) 
==22== In this day’s council; but we’ll take tomorrow.
==23== Is’t far you ride?

**BAN.**
==24== As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
==25== ’Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,
==26== I must become a borrower of the night
==27== For a dark hour or twain.

**K. MACB.**
==27==               Fail not our feast.

**BAN.**
==28== My lord, I will not.

**K. MACB.**
==29== We hear our bloody cousins are bestow’d
==30== In England and in Ireland, not confessing
==31== Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
==32== With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,
==33== When therewithal we shall have cause of state
==34== Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse; *adieu*,
==35== Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

**BAN.**
==36== Ay, my good lord. Our time does call upon’s.

**K. MACB.**
==37== I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
==38== And so I do commend you to their backs.
==39== Farewell.
*(Exit Banquo.)*
==40== Let every man be master of his time
==41== Till seven at night. To make society
==42== The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
==43== Till supper-time alone; while then, God be with you!
*(Exeunt Lords with Lady Macbeth and others. Manent Macbeth and a Servant.)*
==44== Sirrah, a word with you. Attend those men
==45== Our pleasure?

**SERV.**
==46== They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

**K. MACB.**
==47== Bring them before us.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==47==            To be thus is nothing,
==48== But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo
==49== Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature
==50== Reigns that which would be fear’d. ’Tis much he dares,
==51== And to that dauntless temper of his mind,
==52== He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
==53== To act in safety. There is none but he
==54== Whose being I do fear; and under him
==55== My Genius is rebuk’d, as it is said
==56== Mark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
==57== When first they put the name of king upon me,
==58== And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like
==59== They hail’d him father to a line of kings.
==60== Upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crown,
==61== And put a barren scepter in my gripe,
==62== Thence to be wrench’d with an unlineal hand,
==63== No son of mine succeeding. If’t be so,
==64== For Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind,
==65== For them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d,
==66== Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
==67== Only for them, and mine eternal jewel
==68== Given to the common enemy of man,
==69== To make them kings—the seeds of Banquo kings!
==70== Rather than so, come fate into the list,
==71== And champion me to th’ utterance! Who’s there?
*(Enter Servant and two Murderers.)*
==72== Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==73== Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

**BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.**
==74== It was, so please your Highness.

**K. MACB.**
==74==                   Well then, now
==75== Have you consider’d of my speeches?—know
==76== That it was he in the times past which held you
==77== So under fortune, which you thought had been
==78== Our innocent self? This I made good to you
==79== In our last conference, pass’d in probation with you:
==80== How you were borne in hand, how cross’d, the instruments,
==81== Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
==82== To half a soul and to a notion craz’d
==83== Say, “Thus did Banquo.”

**1. MUR.**
==83==               You made it known to us.

**K. MACB.**
==84== I did so; and went further, which is now
==85== Our point of second meeting. Do you find
==86== Your patience so predominant in your nature
==87== That you can let this go? Are you so gospell’d,
==88== To pray for this good man, and for his issue,
==89== Whose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the grave,
==90== And beggar’d yours forever?

**1. MUR.**
==90==                 We are men, my liege.

**K. MACB.**
==91== Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,
==92== As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
==93== Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clipt
==94== All by the name of dogs; the valued file
==95== Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
==96== The house-keeper, the hunter, every one,
==97== According to the gift which bounteous nature
==98== Hath in him clos’d; whereby he does receive
==99== Particular addition, from the bill
==100== That writes them all alike: and so of men.
==101== Now, if you have a station in the file,
==102== Not i’ th’ worst rank of manhood, say’t,
==103== And I will put that business in your bosoms,
==104== Whose execution takes your enemy off,
==105== Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
==106== Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
==107== Which in his death were perfect.

**2. MUR.**
==107==                   I am one, my liege,
==108== Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
==109== Hath so incens’d that I am reckless what
==110== I do to spite the world.

**1. MUR.**
==110==               And I another,
==111== So weary with disasters, tugg’d with fortune,
==112== That I would set my life on any chance,
==113== To mend it, or be rid on’t.

**K. MACB.**
==113==               Both of you
==114== Know Banquo was your enemy.

**BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.**
==114==                   True, my lord.

**K. MACB.**
==115== So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
==116== That every minute of his being thrusts
==117== Against my near’st of life; and though I could
==118== With barefac’d power sweep him from my sight,
==119== And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
==120== For certain friends that are both his and mine,
==121== Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
==122== Who I myself struck down. And thence it is
==123== That I to your assistance do make love,
==124== Masking the business from the common eye
==125== For sundry weighty reasons.

**2. MUR.**
==125==                 We shall, my lord,
==126== Perform what you command us.

**1. MUR.**
==126==                   Though our lives⁠—

**K. MACB.**
==127== Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour, at most,
==128== I will advise you where to plant yourselves,
==129== Acquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ time,
==130== The moment on’t, for’t must be done tonight,
==131== And something from the palace; always thought
==132== That I require a clearness: and with him⁠—
==133== To leave no rubs nor botches in the work⁠—
==134== Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
==135== Whose absence is no less material to me
==136== Than is his father’s, must embrace the fate
==137== Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart,
==138== I’ll come to you anon.

**BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.**
==138==            We are resolv’d, my lord.

**K. MACB.**
==139== I’ll call upon you straight; abide within.
*(Exeunt Murderers.)*
==140== It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul’s flight,
==141== If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.

*Exit.*
