## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*England. Before the King’s palace.*

*Enter Malcolm and Macduff.*

**MAL.**
==1== Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
==2== Weep our sad bosoms empty.

**MACD.**
==2==                 Let us rather
==3== Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
==4== Bestride our downfall birthdom. Each new morn
==5== New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
==6== Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
==7== As if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out
==8== Like syllable of dolor.

**MAL.**
==8==               What I believe, I’ll wail,
==9== What know, believe; and what I can redress,
==10== As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
==11== What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
==12== This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
==13== Was once thought honest; you have lov’d him well;
==14== He hath not touch’d you yet. I am young, but something
==15== You may discern of him through me, and wisdom
==16== To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb
==17== T’ appease an angry god.

**MACD.**
==18== I am not treacherous.

**MAL.**
==18==            But Macbeth is.
==19== A good and virtuous nature may recoil
==20== In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon;
==21== That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose:
==22== Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
==23== Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
==24== Yet grace must still look so.

**MACD.**
==24==               I have lost my hopes.

**MAL.**
==25== Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
==26== Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
==27== Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
==28== Without leave-taking? I pray you,
==29== Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,
==30== But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
==31== What ever I shall think.

**MACD.**
==31==            Bleed, bleed, poor country!
==32== Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,
==33== For goodness dare not check thee; wear thou thy wrongs,
==34== The title is affeer’d! Fare thee well, lord,
==35== I would not be the villain that thou think’st
==36== For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,
==37== And the rich East to boot.

**MAL.**
==37==               Be not offended;
==38== I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
==39== I think our country sinks beneath the yoke:
==40== It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
==41== Is added to her wounds. I think withal
==42== There would be hands uplifted in my right;
==43== And here from gracious England have I offer
==44== Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,
==45== When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,
==46== Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
==47== Shall have more vices than it had before,
==48== More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,
==49== By him that shall succeed.

**MACD.**
==49==               What should he be?

**MAL.**
==50== It is myself I mean; in whom I know
==51== All the particulars of vice so grafted
==52== That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth
==53== Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
==54== Esteem him as a lamb, being compar’d
==55== With my confineless harms.

**MACD.**
==55==               Not in the legions
==56== Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d
==57== In evils to top Macbeth.

**MAL.**
==57==               I grant him bloody,
==58== Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
==59== Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
==60== That has a name; but there’s no bottom, none,
==61== In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,
==62== Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up
==63== The cistern of my lust, and my desire
==64== All continent impediments would o’erbear
==65== That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth
==66== Than such an one to reign.

**MACD.**
==66==               Boundless intemperance
==67== In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
==68== Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,
==69== And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
==70== To take upon you what is yours. You may
==71== Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
==72== And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
==73== We have willing dames enough; there cannot be
==74== That vulture in you to devour so many
==75== As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
==76== Finding it so inclin’d.

**MAL.**
==76==            With this, there grows
==77== In my most ill-compos’d affection such
==78== A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
==79== I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
==80== Desire his jewels, and this other’s house,
==81== And my more-having would be as a sauce
==82== To make me hunger more, that I should forge
==83== Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
==84== Destroying them for wealth.

**MACD.**
==84==                 This avarice
==85== Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
==86== Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been
==87== The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear,
==88== Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will
==89== Of your mere own. All these are portable,
==90== With other graces weigh’d.

**MAL.**
==91== But I have none. The king-becoming graces,
==92== As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,
==93== Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
==94== Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
==95== I have no relish of them, but abound
==96== In the division of each several crime,
==97== Acting it many ways. Nay, had I pow’r, I should
==98== Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
==99== Uproar the universal peace, confound
==100== All unity on earth.

**MACD.**
==100==            O Scotland, Scotland!

**MAL.**
==101== If such a one be fit to govern, speak.
==102== I am as I have spoken.

**MACD.**
==102==            Fit to govern?
==103== No, not to live. O nation miserable!
==104== With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepterd,
==105== When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
==106== Since that the truest issue of thy throne
==107== By his own interdiction stands accus’d,
==108== And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
==109== Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,
==110== Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,
==111== Died every day she liv’d. Fare thee well,
==112== These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself
==113== Hath banish’d me from Scotland. O my breast,
==114== Thy hope ends here!

**MAL.**
==114==            Macduff, this noble passion,
==115== Child of integrity, hath from my soul
==116== Wip’d the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts
==117== To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth
==118== By many of these trains hath sought to win me
==119== Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
==120== From over-credulous haste. But God above
==121== Deal between thee and me! For even now
==122== I put myself to thy direction, and
==123== Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure
==124== The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
==125== For strangers to my nature. I am yet
==126== Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
==127== Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
==128== At no time broke my faith, would not betray
==129== The devil to his fellow, and delight
==130== No less in truth than life. My first false speaking
==131== Was this upon myself. What I am truly
==132== Is thine and my poor country’s to command:
==133== Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
==134== Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men
==135== Already at a point, was setting forth.
==136== Now we’ll together, and the chance of goodness
==137== Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?

**MACD.**
==138== Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
==139== ’Tis hard to reconcile.

*Enter English Doctor.*

**MAL.**
==140== Well, more anon.—Comes the King forth, I pray you?

**DOCT.**
==141== Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
==142== That stay his cure. Their malady convinces
==143== The great assay of art; but at his touch,
==144== Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,
==145== They presently amend.

**MAL.**
==145==               I thank you, doctor.

*Exit English Doctor.*

**MACD.**
==146== What’s the disease he means?

**MAL.**
==146==                 ’Tis call’d the evil:
==147== A most miraculous work in this good king,
==148== Which often, since my here-remain in England,
==149== I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
==150== Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,
==151== All swoll’n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
==152== The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
==153== Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
==154== Put on with holy prayers, and ’tis spoken,
==155== To the succeeding royalty he leaves
==156== The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
==157== He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
==158== And sundry blessings hang about his throne
==159== That speak him full of grace.

*Enter Rosse.*

**MACD.**
==159==               See who comes here.

**MAL.**
==160== My countryman; but yet I know him not.

**MACD.**
==161== My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.

**MAL.**
==162== I know him now. Good God betimes remove
==163== The means that makes us strangers!

**ROSSE.**
==163==                      Sir, amen.

**MACD.**
==164== Stands Scotland where it did?

**ROSSE.**
==164==                 Alas, poor country,
==165== Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot
==166== Be call’d our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
==167== But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
==168== Where sighs, and groans, and shrieks that rent the air
==169== Are made, not mark’d; where violent sorrow seems
==170== A modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knell
==171== Is there scarce ask’d for who, and good men’s lives
==172== Expire before the flowers in their caps,
==173== Dying or ere they sicken.

**MACD.**
==173==               O relation!
==174== Too nice, and yet too true.

**MAL.**
==174==               What’s the newest grief?

**ROSSE.**
==175== That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;
==176== Each minute teems a new one.

**MACD.**
==176==                 How does my wife?

**ROSSE.**
==177== Why, well.

**MACD.**
==177==         And all my children?

**ROSSE.**
==177==                      Well too.

**MACD.**
==178== The tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?

**ROSSE.**
==179== No, they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.

**MACD.**
==180== Be not a niggard of your speech; how goes’t?

**ROSSE.**
==181== When I came hither to transport the tidings,
==182== Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor
==183== Of many worthy fellows that were out,
==184== Which was to my belief witness’d the rather,
==185== For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.
==186== Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
==187== Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
==188== To doff their dire distresses.

**MAL.**
==188==                 Be’t their comfort
==189== We are coming thither. Gracious England hath
==190== Lent us good Siward, and ten thousand men;
==191== An older and a better soldier none
==192== That Christendom gives out.

**ROSSE.**
==192==               Would I could answer
==193== This comfort with the like! But I have words
==194== That would be howl’d out in the desert air,
==195== Where hearing should not latch them.

**MACD.**
==195==                      What concern they?
==196== The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief
==197== Due to some single breast?

**ROSSE.**
==197==               No mind that’s honest
==198== But in it shares some woe, though the main part
==199== Pertains to you alone.

**MACD.**
==199==            If it be mine,
==200== Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

**ROSSE.**
==201== Let not your ears despise my tongue forever,
==202== Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
==203== That ever yet they heard.

**MACD.**
==203==               Humh! I guess at it.

**ROSSE.**
==204== Your castle is surpris’d; your wife, and babes,
==205== Savagely slaughter’d. To relate the manner,
==206== Were on the quarry of these murder’d deer
==207== To add the death of you.

**MAL.**
==207==               Merciful heaven!
==208== What, man, ne’er pull your hat upon your brows;
==209== Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak
==210== Whispers the o’er-fraught heart, and bids it break.

**MACD.**
==211== My children too?

**ROSSE.**
==211==            Wife, children, servants, all
==212== That could be found.

**MACD.**
==212==            And I must be from thence!
==213== My wife kill’d too?

**ROSSE.**
==213==            I have said.

**MAL.**
==213==                   Be comforted.
==214== Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge
==215== To cure this deadly grief.

**MACD.**
==216== He has no children. All my pretty ones?
==217== Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
==218== What, all my pretty chickens, and their dam,
==219== At one fell swoop?

**MAL.**
==220== Dispute it like a man.

**MACD.**
==220==            I shall do so;
==221== But I must also feel it as a man:
==222== I cannot but remember such things were,
==223== That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
==224== And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
==225== They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,
==226== Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
==227== Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!

**MAL.**
==228== Be this the whetstone of your sword, let grief
==229== Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

**MACD.**
==230== O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,
==231== And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
==232== Cut short all intermission. Front to front
==233== Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
==234== Within my sword’s length set him; if he scape,
==235== Heaven forgive him too!

**MAL.**
==235==               This tune goes manly.
==236== Come go we to the King, our power is ready,
==237== Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth
==238== Is ripe for shaking, and the pow’rs above
==239== Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may,
==240== The night is long that never finds the day.

*Exeunt.*
