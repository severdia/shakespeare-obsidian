## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Dunsinane. A room in the castle.*

*Enter Macbeth, English Doctor, and Attendants.*

**K. MACB.**
==1== Bring me no more reports, let them fly all.
==2== Till Birnan wood remove to Dunsinane
==3== I cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?
==4== Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
==5== All mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus:
==6== “Fear not, Macbeth, no man that’s born of woman
==7== Shall e’er have power upon thee.” Then fly, false thanes,
==8== And mingle with the English epicures!
==9== The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,
==10== Shall never sag with doubt, nor shake with fear.
*(Enter Servant.)*
==11== The devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac’d loon!
==12== Where got’st thou that goose-look?

**SERV.**
==13== There is ten thousand⁠—

**K. MACB.**
==13==            Geese, villain?

**SERV.**
==13==                      Soldiers, sir.

**K. MACB.**
==14== Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
==15== Thou lily-liver’d boy. What soldiers, patch?
==16== Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
==17== Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

**SERV.**
==18== The English force, so please you.

**K. MACB.**
==19== Take thy face hence.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==19==            Seyton!—I am sick at heart
==20== When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push
==21== Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
==22== I have liv’d long enough: my way of life
==23== Is fall’n into the sear, the yellow leaf,
==24== And that which should accompany old age,
==25== As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
==26== I must not look to have; but in their stead,
==27== Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,
==28== Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
==29== Seyton!

*Enter Seyton.*

**SEY.**
==30== What’s your gracious pleasure?

**K. MACB.**
==30==                 What news more?

**SEY.**
==31== All is confirm’d, my lord, which was reported.

**K. MACB.**
==32== I’ll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack’d.
==33== Give me my armor.

**SEY.**
==33==            ’Tis not needed yet.

**K. MACB.**
==34== I’ll put it on.
==35== Send out more horses, skirr the country round,
==36== Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor.
==37== How does your patient, doctor?

**DOCT.**
==37==                 Not so sick, my lord,
==38== As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
==39== That keep her from her rest.

**K. MACB.**
==39==               Cure her of that.
==40== Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d,
==41== Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
==42== Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
==43== And with some sweet oblivious antidote
==44== Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff
==45== Which weighs upon the heart?

**DOCT.**
==45==                 Therein the patient
==46== Must minister to himself.

**K. MACB.**
==47== Throw physic to the dogs, I’ll none of it.
==48== Come, put mine armor on; give me my staff.
==49== Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.⁠—
==50== Come, sir, dispatch.— If thou couldst, doctor, cast
==51== The water of my land, find her disease,
==52== And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
==53== I would applaud thee to the very echo,
==54== That should applaud again.—Pull’t off, I say.⁠—
==55== What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
==56== Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of them?

**DOCT.**
==57== Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
==58== Makes us hear something.

**K. MACB.**
==58==               Bring it after me.⁠—
==59== I will not be afraid of death and bane,
==60== Till Birnan forest come to Dunsinane.

*Exeunt all but the English Doctor.*

**DOCT.**
==61== Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
==62== Profit again should hardly draw me here.

*Exit.*
