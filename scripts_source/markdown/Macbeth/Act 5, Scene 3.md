## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Dunsinane. A room in the castle.*

*Enter Macbeth, English Doctor, and Attendants.*

**K. MACB.**
Bring me no more reports, let them fly all.
Till Birnan wood remove to Dunsinane
I cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus:
“Fear not, Macbeth, no man that’s born of woman
Shall e’er have power upon thee.” Then fly, false thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures!
The mind I sway by, and the heart I bear,
Shall never sag with doubt, nor shake with fear.
*(Enter Servant.)*
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-fac’d loon!
Where got’st thou that goose-look?

**SERV.**
There is ten thousand⁠—

**K. MACB.**
           Geese, villain?

**SERV.**
                     Soldiers, sir.

**K. MACB.**
Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liver’d boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

**SERV.**
The English force, so please you.

**K. MACB.**
Take thy face hence.
*(Exit Servant.)*
           Seyton!—I am sick at heart
When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
I have liv’d long enough: my way of life
Is fall’n into the sear, the yellow leaf,
And that which should accompany old age,
As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but in their stead,
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.
Seyton!

*Enter Seyton.*

**SEY.**
What’s your gracious pleasure?

**K. MACB.**
                What news more?

**SEY.**
All is confirm’d, my lord, which was reported.

**K. MACB.**
I’ll fight, till from my bones my flesh be hack’d.
Give me my armor.

**SEY.**
           ’Tis not needed yet.

**K. MACB.**
I’ll put it on.
Send out more horses, skirr the country round,
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor.
How does your patient, doctor?

**DOCT.**
                Not so sick, my lord,
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,
That keep her from her rest.

**K. MACB.**
              Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’d,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?

**DOCT.**
                Therein the patient
Must minister to himself.

**K. MACB.**
Throw physic to the dogs, I’ll none of it.
Come, put mine armor on; give me my staff.
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.⁠—
Come, sir, dispatch.— If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo,
That should applaud again.—Pull’t off, I say.⁠—
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
Would scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of them?

**DOCT.**
Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
Makes us hear something.

**K. MACB.**
              Bring it after me.⁠—
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
Till Birnan forest come to Dunsinane.

*Exeunt all but the English Doctor.*

**DOCT.**
Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
Profit again should hardly draw me here.

*Exit.*
