## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*Country near Birnam wood.*

*Drum and Colors. Enter Malcolm, Siward, Macduff, Siward’s Son, Menteth, Cathness, Angus, Lennox, Rosse, and Soldiers, marching.*

**MAL.**
==1==Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
==2==That chambers will be safe.

**MENT.**
==2==              We doubt it nothing.

**SIW.**
==3==What wood is this before us?

**MENT.**
==3==                The wood of Birnan.

**MAL.**
==4==Let every soldier hew him down a bough,
==5==And bear’t before him, thereby shall we shadow
==6==The numbers of our host, and make discovery
==7==Err in report of us.

**SOLDIERS.**
==7==           It shall be done.

**SIW.**
==8==We learn no other but the confident tyrant
==9==Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
==10==Our setting down before’t.

**MAL.**
==10==              ’Tis his main hope;
==11==For where there is advantage to be given,
==12==Both more and less have given him the revolt,
==13==And none serve with him but constrained things,
==14==Whose hearts are absent too.

**MACD.**
==14==              Let our just censures
==15==Attend the true event, and put we on
==16==Industrious soldiership.

**SIW.**
==16==           The time approaches
==17==That will with due decision make us know
==18==What we shall say we have, and what we owe.
==19==Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
==20==But certain issue strokes must arbitrate,
==21==Towards which advance the war.

*Exeunt marching.*
