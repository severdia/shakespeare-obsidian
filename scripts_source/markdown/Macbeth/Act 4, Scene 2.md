## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Fife. Macduff’s castle.*

*Enter Macduff’s Wife, her Son, and Rosse.*

**L. MACD.**
What had he done, to make him fly the land?

**ROSSE.**
You must have patience, madam.

**L. MACD.**
                  He had none;
His flight was madness. When our actions do not,
Our fears do make us traitors.

**ROSSE.**
                You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

**L. MACD.**
Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
His mansion and his titles, in a place
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not,
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
All is the fear, and nothing is the love;
As little is the wisdom, where the flight
So runs against all reason.

**ROSSE.**
              My dearest coz,
I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much further,
But cruel are the times when we are traitors,
And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way, and move. I take my leave of you;
’Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you!

**L. MACD.**
Father’d he is, and yet he’s fatherless.

**ROSSE.**
I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
I take my leave at once.

*Exit Rosse.*

**L. MACD.**
              Sirrah, your father’s dead,
And what will you do now? How will you live?

**SON.**
As birds do, mother.

**L. MACD.**
           What, with worms and flies?

**SON.**
With what I get, I mean, and so do they.

**L. MACD.**
Poor bird, thou’dst never fear the net nor lime,
The pitfall nor the gin.

**SON.**
Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
My father is not dead, for all your saying.

**L. MACD.**
Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?

**SON.**
Nay, how will you do for a husband?

**L. MACD.**
Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

**SON.**
Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again.

**L. MACD.**
Thou speak’st with all thy wit, and yet, i’ faith,
With wit enough for thee.

**SON.**
Was my father a traitor, mother?

**L. MACD.**
Ay, that he was.

**SON.**
What is a traitor?

**L. MACD.**
Why, one that swears and lies.

**SON.**
And be all traitors that do so?

**L. MACD.**
Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hang’d.

**SON.**
And must they all be hang’d that swear and lie?

**L. MACD.**
Every one.

**SON.**
Who must hang them?

**L. MACD.**
Why, the honest men.

**SON.**
Then the liars and swearers are fools; for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.

**L. MACD.**
Now God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?

**SON.**
If he were dead, you’ld weep for him; if you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.

**L. MACD.**
Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
If you will take a homely man’s advice,
Be not found here; hence with your little ones.
To fright you thus, methinks I am too savage;
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
I dare abide no longer.

*Exit Messenger.*

**L. MACD.**
              Whither should I fly?
I have done no harm. But I remember now
I am in this earthly world—where to do harm
Is often laudable, to do good sometime
Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,
Do I put up that womanly defense,
To say I have done no harm?
*(Enter Murderers.)*
                What are these faces?

**1. MUR.**
Where is your husband?

**L. MACD.**
I hope, in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him.

**1. MUR.**
                     He’s a traitor.

**SON.**
Thou li’st, thou shag-ear’d villain!

**1. MUR.**
                  What, you egg!
*(Stabbing him.)*
Young fry of treachery!

**SON.**
              He has kill’d me, mother:
Run away, I pray you!

*Dies.*

*Exit Lady Macduff crying “Murder!” and pursued by the Murderers.*
