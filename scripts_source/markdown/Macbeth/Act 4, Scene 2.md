## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Fife. Macduff’s castle.*

*Enter Macduff’s Wife, her Son, and Rosse.*

**L. MACD.**
==1==What had he done, to make him fly the land?

**ROSSE.**
==2==You must have patience, madam.

**L. MACD.**
==2==                  He had none;
==3==His flight was madness. When our actions do not,
==4==Our fears do make us traitors.

**ROSSE.**
==4==                You know not
==5==Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

**L. MACD.**
==6==Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,
==7==His mansion and his titles, in a place
==8==From whence himself does fly? He loves us not,
==9==He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,
==10==The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
==11==Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
==12==All is the fear, and nothing is the love;
==13==As little is the wisdom, where the flight
==14==So runs against all reason.

**ROSSE.**
==14==              My dearest coz,
==15==I pray you school yourself. But for your husband,
==16==He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
==17==The fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much further,
==18==But cruel are the times when we are traitors,
==19==And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor
==20==From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
==21==But float upon a wild and violent sea
==22==Each way, and move. I take my leave of you;
==23==’Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.
==24==Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
==25==To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
==26==Blessing upon you!

**L. MACD.**
==27==Father’d he is, and yet he’s fatherless.

**ROSSE.**
==28==I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
==29==It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.
==30==I take my leave at once.

*Exit Rosse.*

**L. MACD.**
==30==              Sirrah, your father’s dead,
==31==And what will you do now? How will you live?

**SON.**
==32==As birds do, mother.

**L. MACD.**
==32==           What, with worms and flies?

**SON.**
==33==With what I get, I mean, and so do they.

**L. MACD.**
==34==Poor bird, thou’dst never fear the net nor lime,
==35==The pitfall nor the gin.

**SON.**
==36==Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
==37==My father is not dead, for all your saying.

**L. MACD.**
==38==Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for a father?

**SON.**
==39==Nay, how will you do for a husband?

**L. MACD.**
==40==Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

**SON.**
==41==Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again.

**L. MACD.**
==42==Thou speak’st with all thy wit, and yet, i’faith,
==43==With wit enough for thee.

**SON.**
==44==Was my father a traitor, mother?

**L. MACD.**
==45==Ay, that he was.

**SON.**
==46==What is a traitor?

**L. MACD.**
==47==Why, one that swears and lies.

**SON.**
==48==And be all traitors that do so?

**L. MACD.**
==49==Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hang’d.

**SON.**
==50==And must they all be hang’d that swear and lie?

**L. MACD.**
==51==Every one.

**SON.**
==52==Who must hang them?

**L. MACD.**
==53==Why, the honest men.

**SON.**
==54==Then the liars and swearers are fools; for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.

**L. MACD.**
==55==Now God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?

**SON.**
==56==If he were dead, you’ld weep for him; if you would not, it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.

**L. MACD.**
==57==Poor prattler, how thou talk’st!

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
==58==Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
==59==Though in your state of honor I am perfect.
==60==I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.
==61==If you will take a homely man’s advice,
==62==Be not found here; hence with your little ones.
==63==To fright you thus, methinks I am too savage;
==64==To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
==65==Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
==66==I dare abide no longer.

*Exit Messenger.*

**L. MACD.**
==66==              Whither should I fly?
==67==I have done no harm. But I remember now
==68==I am in this earthly world—where to do harm
==69==Is often laudable, to do good sometime
==70==Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,
==71==Do I put up that womanly defense,
==72==To say I have done no harm?
*(Enter Murderers.)*
==72==                What are these faces?

**1. MUR.**
==73==Where is your husband?

**L. MACD.**
==74==I hope, in no place so unsanctified
==75==Where such as thou mayst find him.

**1. MUR.**
==75==                     He’s a traitor.

**SON.**
==76==Thou li’st, thou shag-ear’d villain!

**1. MUR.**
==76==                  What, you egg!
*(Stabbing him.)*
==77==Young fry of treachery!

**SON.**
==77==              He has kill’d me, mother:
==78==Run away, I pray you!

*Dies.*

*Exit Lady Macduff crying “Murder!” and pursued by the Murderers.*
