## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*A camp near Forres.*

*Alarum within. Enter King Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant.*

**DUN.**
==1==What bloody man is that? He can report,
==2==As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
==3==The newest state.

**MAL.**
==3==           This is the sergeant,
==4==Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
==5==’Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
==6==Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
==7==As thou didst leave it.

**SERG.**
==7==              Doubtful it stood,
==8==As two spent swimmers that do cling together
==9==And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald
==10==(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
==11==The multiplying villainies of nature
==12==Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles
==13==Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied,
==14==And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
==15==Show’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;
==16==For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),
==17==Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish’d steel,
==18==Which smok’d with bloody execution,
==19==(Like Valor’s minion) carv’d out his passage
==20==Till he fac’d the slave;
==21==Which nev’r shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
==22==Till he unseam’d him from the nave to th’ chops,
==23==And fix’d his head upon our battlements.

**DUN.**
==24==O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!

**SERG.**
==25==As whence the sun gins his reflection
==26==Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,
==27==So from that spring whence comfort seem’d to come
==28==Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark!
==29==No sooner justice had, with valor arm’d,
==30==Compell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
==31==But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
==32==With furbish’d arms and new supplies of men,
==33==Began a fresh assault.

**DUN.**
==33==           Dismay’d not this
==34==Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

**SERG.**
==34==                       Yes,
==35==As sparrows eagles; or the hare the lion.
==36==If I say sooth, I must report they were
==37==As cannons overcharg’d with double cracks, so they
==38==Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
==39==Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
==40==Or memorize another Golgotha,
==41==I cannot tell⁠—
==42==But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

**DUN.**
==43==So well thy words become thee as thy wounds,
==44==They smack of honor both. Go get him surgeons.
*(Exit Sergeant, attended.)*
*(Enter Rosse and Angus.)*
==45==Who comes here?

**MAL.**
==45==           The worthy Thane of Rosse.

**LEN.**
==46==What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
==47==That seems to speak things strange.

**ROSSE.**
==47==                  God save the King!

**DUN.**
==48==Whence cam’st thou, worthy thane?

**ROSSE.**
==48==                  From Fife, great King,
==49==Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
==50==And fan our people cold.
==51==Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
==52==Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
==53==The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
==54==Till that Bellona’s bridegroom, lapp’d in proof,
==55==Confronted him with self-comparisons,
==56==Point against point, rebellious arm ’gainst arm,
==57==Curbing his lavish spirit; and to conclude,
==58==The victory fell on us.

**DUN.**
==58==           Great happiness!

**ROSSE.**
==58==                     That now
==59==Sweno, the Norways’ king, craves composition;
==60==Nor would we deign him burial of his men
==61==Till he disbursed at Saint Colme’s inch
==62==Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

**DUN.**
==63==No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
==64==Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,
==65==And with his former title greet Macbeth.

**ROSSE.**
==66==I’ll see it done.

**DUN.**
==67==What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

*Exeunt.*
