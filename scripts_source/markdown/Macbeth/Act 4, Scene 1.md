## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*A cavern.*

*Thunder. Enter the three Witches.*

**1. WITCH.**
Thrice the brinded cat hath mew’d.

**2. WITCH.**
Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whin’d.

**3. WITCH.**
Harpier cries, “’Tis time, ’tis time.”

**1. WITCH.**
Round about the cauldron go;
In the poison’d entrails throw;
Toad, that under cold stone
Days and nights has thirty-one
Swelt’red venom sleeping got,
Boil thou first i’ th’ charmed pot.

**THREE WITCHES**
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

**2. WITCH.**
Fillet of a fenny snake,
In the cauldron boil and bake;
Eye of newt and toe of frog,
Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Adder’s fork and blind-worm’s sting,
Lizard’s leg and howlet’s wing,
For a charm of pow’rful trouble,
Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

**THREE WITCHES**
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

**3. WITCH.**
Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
Witch’s mummy, maw and gulf
Of the ravin’d salt-sea shark,
Root of hemlock digg’d i’ th’ dark,
Liver of blaspheming Jew,
Gall of goat, and slips of yew
Sliver’d in the moon’s eclipse,
Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips,
Finger of birth-strangled babe
Ditch-deliver’d by a drab,
Make the gruel thick and slab.
Add thereto a tiger’s chawdron,
For th’ ingredience of our cau’dron.

**THREE WITCHES**
Double, double, toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

**2. WITCH.**
Cool it with a baboon’s blood,
Then the charm is firm and good.

*Enter Hecat and the other three Witches.*

**HEC.**
O, well done! I commend your pains,
And every one shall share i’ th’ gains.
And now about the cauldron sing,
Like elves and fairies in a ring,
Enchanting all that you put in.

*Music and a song: “Black spirits, etc.” *

*Exit Hecat.*

**2. WITCH.**
By the pricking of my thumbs,
Something wicked this way comes.
*(Knocking.)*
    Open, locks,
    Whoever knocks!

*Enter Macbeth.*

**K. MACB.**
How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
What is’t you do?

**ALL WITCHES**
           A deed without a name.

**K. MACB.**
I conjure you, by that which you profess
(How e’er you come to know it), answer me:
Though you untie the winds, and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodg’d, and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders’ heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature’s germains tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken; answer me
To what I ask you.

**1. WITCH.**
           Speak.

**2. WITCH.**
                Demand.

**3. WITCH.**
                     We’ll answer.

**1. WITCH.**
Say, if th’ hadst rather hear it from our mouths,
Or from our masters’?

**K. MACB.**
           Call ’em; let me see ’em.

**1. WITCH.**
Pour in sow’s blood, that hath eaten
Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten
From the murderer’s gibbet throw
Into the flame.

**ALL WITCHES**
        Come high or low;
Thyself and office deftly show!

*Thunder. First Apparition, an armed Head.*

**K. MACB.**
Tell me, thou unknown power⁠—

**1. WITCH.**
                He knows thy thought:
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

**1. APP.**
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff,
Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.

*He descends.*

**K. MACB.**
What e’er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp’d my fear aright. But one word more⁠—

**1. WITCH.**
He will not be commanded. Here’s another,
More potent than the first.

*Thunder. Second Apparition, a bloody Child.*

**2. APP.**
Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

**K. MACB.**
Had I three ears, I’ld hear thee.

**2. APP.**
Be bloody, bold, and resolute: laugh to scorn
The pow’r of man; for none of woman born
Shall harm Macbeth.

*Descends.*

**K. MACB.**
Then live, Macduff; what need I fear of thee?
But yet I’ll make assurance double sure,
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live,
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.
*(Thunder. Third Apparition, a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand.)*
                What is this
That rises like the issue of a king,
And wears upon his baby-brow the round
And top of sovereignty?

**ALL WITCHES, APP.**
              Listen, but speak not to’t.

**3. APP.**
Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
Macbeth shall never vanquish’d be until
Great Birnan wood to high Dunsinane hill
Shall come against him.

*Descend.*

**K. MACB.**
              That will never be.
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! Good!
Rebellious dead, rise never till the wood
Of Birnan rise, and our high-plac’d Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
Can tell so much, shall Banquo’s issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?

**ALL WITCHES, APP.**
              Seek to know no more.

**K. MACB.**
I will be satisfied. Deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron? And what noise is this?

*Hoboys.*

**1. WITCH.**
Show!

**2. WITCH.**
Show!

**3. WITCH.**
Show!

**ALL WITCHES**
Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
Come like shadows, so depart.

*A show of eight Kings, the eighth with a glass in his hand, and Banquo last.*

**K. MACB.**
Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo; down!
Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former. Filthy hags,
Why do you show me this?—A fourth? Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom?
Another yet? A seventh? I’ll see no more.
And yet the eight appears, who bears a glass
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That twofold balls and treble scepters carry.
Horrible sight! Now I see ’tis true,
For the blood-bolter’d Banquo smiles upon me,
And points at them for his.
*(Apparitions vanish.)*
              What? Is this so?

**1. WITCH.**
Ay, sir, all this is so. But why
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
And show the best of our delights.
I’ll charm the air to give a sound,
While you perform your antic round;
That this great king may kindly say
Our duties did his welcome pay.

*Music.*

*The Witches dance and vanish.*

**K. MACB.**
Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
Come in, without there!

*Enter Lennox.*

**LEN.**
              What’s your Grace’s will?

**K. MACB.**
Saw you the weird sisters?

**LEN.**
              No, my lord.

**K. MACB.**
Came they not by you?

**LEN.**
              No indeed, my lord.

**K. MACB.**
Infected be the air whereon they ride,
And damn’d all those that trust them! I did hear
The galloping of horse. Who was’t came by?

**LEN.**
’Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
Macduff is fled to England.

**K. MACB.**
              Fled to England!

**LEN.**
Ay, my good lord.

**K. MACB.**
*(Aside.)*
Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits:
The flighty purpose never is o’ertook
Unless the deed go with it. From this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
Seize upon Fife, give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?
Come bring me where they are.

*Exeunt.*
