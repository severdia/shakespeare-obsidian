## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*A cavern.*

*Thunder. Enter the three Witches.*

**1. WITCH.**
==1==Thrice the brinded cat hath mew’d.

**2. WITCH.**
==2==Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whin’d.

**3. WITCH.**
==3==Harpier cries, “’Tis time, ’tis time.”

**1. WITCH.**
==4==Round about the cauldron go;
==5==In the poison’d entrails throw;
==6==Toad, that under cold stone
==7==Days and nights has thirty-one
==8==Swelt’red venom sleeping got,
==9==Boil thou first i’ th’ charmed pot.

**THREE WITCHES**
==10==Double, double, toil and trouble;
==11==Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

**2. WITCH.**
==12==Fillet of a fenny snake,
==13==In the cauldron boil and bake;
==14==Eye of newt and toe of frog,
==15==Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
==16==Adder’s fork and blind-worm’s sting,
==17==Lizard’s leg and howlet’s wing,
==18==For a charm of pow’rful trouble,
==19==Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

**THREE WITCHES**
==20==Double, double, toil and trouble;
==21==Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

**3. WITCH.**
==22==Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
==23==Witch’s mummy, maw and gulf
==24==Of the ravin’d salt-sea shark,
==25==Root of hemlock digg’d i’ th’ dark,
==26==Liver of blaspheming Jew,
==27==Gall of goat, and slips of yew
==28==Sliver’d in the moon’s eclipse,
==29==Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips,
==30==Finger of birth-strangled babe
==31==Ditch-deliver’d by a drab,
==32==Make the gruel thick and slab.
==33==Add thereto a tiger’s chawdron,
==34==For th’ ingredience of our cau’dron.

**THREE WITCHES**
==35==Double, double, toil and trouble;
==36==Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

**2. WITCH.**
==37==Cool it with a baboon’s blood,
==38==Then the charm is firm and good.

*Enter Hecat and the other three Witches.*

**HEC.**
==39==O, well done! I commend your pains,
==40==And every one shall share i’ th’ gains.
==41==And now about the cauldron sing,
==42==Like elves and fairies in a ring,
==43==Enchanting all that you put in.

*Music and a song: “Black spirits, etc.” *

*Exit Hecat.*

**2. WITCH.**
==44==By the pricking of my thumbs,
==45==Something wicked this way comes.
*(Knocking.)*
==45==    Open, locks,
==45==    Whoever knocks!

*Enter Macbeth.*

**K. MACB.**
==46==How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?
==47==What is’t you do?

**ALL WITCHES**
==47==           A deed without a name.

**K. MACB.**
==48==I conjure you, by that which you profess
==49==(How e’er you come to know it), answer me:
==50==Though you untie the winds, and let them fight
==51==Against the churches; though the yesty waves
==52==Confound and swallow navigation up;
==53==Though bladed corn be lodg’d, and trees blown down;
==54==Though castles topple on their warders’ heads;
==55==Though palaces and pyramids do slope
==56==Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
==57==Of nature’s germains tumble all together,
==58==Even till destruction sicken; answer me
==59==To what I ask you.

**1. WITCH.**
==59==           Speak.

**2. WITCH.**
==59==                Demand.

**3. WITCH.**
==59==                     We’ll answer.

**1. WITCH.**
==60==Say, if th’ hadst rather hear it from our mouths,
==61==Or from our masters’?

**K. MACB.**
==61==           Call ’em; let me see ’em.

**1. WITCH.**
==62==Pour in sow’s blood, that hath eaten
==63==Her nine farrow; grease that’s sweaten
==64==From the murderer’s gibbet throw
==65==Into the flame.

**ALL WITCHES**
==65==        Come high or low;
==66==Thyself and office deftly show!

*Thunder. First Apparition, an armed Head.*

**K. MACB.**
==67==Tell me, thou unknown power⁠—

**1. WITCH.**
==67==                He knows thy thought:
==68==Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

**1. APP.**
==69==Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff,
==70==Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.

*He descends.*

**K. MACB.**
==71==What e’er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
==72==Thou hast harp’d my fear aright. But one word more⁠—

**1. WITCH.**
==73==He will not be commanded. Here’s another,
==74==More potent than the first.

*Thunder. Second Apparition, a bloody Child.*

**2. APP.**
==75==Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

**K. MACB.**
==76==Had I three ears, I’ld hear thee.

**2. APP.**
==77==Be bloody, bold, and resolute: laugh to scorn
==78==The pow’r of man; for none of woman born
==79==Shall harm Macbeth.

*Descends.*

**K. MACB.**
==80==Then live, Macduff; what need I fear of thee?
==81==But yet I’ll make assurance double sure,
==82==And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live,
==83==That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
==84==And sleep in spite of thunder.
*(Thunder. Third Apparition, a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand.)*
==84==                What is this
==85==That rises like the issue of a king,
==86==And wears upon his baby-brow the round
==87==And top of sovereignty?

**ALL WITCHES, APP.**
==87==              Listen, but speak not to’t.

**3. APP.**
==88==Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care
==89==Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
==90==Macbeth shall never vanquish’d be until
==91==Great Birnan wood to high Dunsinane hill
==92==Shall come against him.

*Descend.*

**K. MACB.**
==92==              That will never be.
==93==Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
==94==Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! Good!
==95==Rebellious dead, rise never till the wood
==96==Of Birnan rise, and our high-plac’d Macbeth
==97==Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
==98==To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
==99==Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
==100==Can tell so much, shall Banquo’s issue ever
==101==Reign in this kingdom?

**ALL WITCHES, APP.**
==101==              Seek to know no more.

**K. MACB.**
==102==I will be satisfied. Deny me this,
==103==And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
==104==Why sinks that cauldron? And what noise is this?

*Hoboys.*

**1. WITCH.**
==105==Show!

**2. WITCH.**
==106==Show!

**3. WITCH.**
==107==Show!

**ALL WITCHES**
==108==Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
==109==Come like shadows, so depart.

*A show of eight Kings, the eighth with a glass in his hand, and Banquo last.*

**K. MACB.**
==110==Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo; down!
==111==Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,
==112==Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
==113==A third is like the former. Filthy hags,
==114==Why do you show me this?—A fourth? Start, eyes!
==115==What, will the line stretch out to th’ crack of doom?
==116==Another yet? A seventh? I’ll see no more.
==117==And yet the eight appears, who bears a glass
==118==Which shows me many more; and some I see
==119==That twofold balls and treble scepters carry.
==120==Horrible sight! Now I see ’tis true,
==121==For the blood-bolter’d Banquo smiles upon me,
==122==And points at them for his.
*(Apparitions vanish.)*
==122==              What? Is this so?

**1. WITCH.**
==123==Ay, sir, all this is so. But why
==124==Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
==125==Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
==126==And show the best of our delights.
==127==I’ll charm the air to give a sound,
==128==While you perform your antic round;
==129==That this great king may kindly say
==130==Our duties did his welcome pay.

*Music.*

*The Witches dance and vanish.*

**K. MACB.**
==131==Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
==132==Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
==133==Come in, without there!

*Enter Lennox.*

**LEN.**
==133==              What’s your Grace’s will?

**K. MACB.**
==134==Saw you the weird sisters?

**LEN.**
==134==              No, my lord.

**K. MACB.**
==135==Came they not by you?

**LEN.**
==135==              No indeed, my lord.

**K. MACB.**
==136==Infected be the air whereon they ride,
==137==And damn’d all those that trust them! I did hear
==138==The galloping of horse. Who was’t came by?

**LEN.**
==139==’Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
==140==Macduff is fled to England.

**K. MACB.**
==140==              Fled to England!

**LEN.**
==141==Ay, my good lord.

**K. MACB.**
*(Aside.)*
==142==Time, thou anticipat’st my dread exploits:
==143==The flighty purpose never is o’ertook
==144==Unless the deed go with it. From this moment
==145==The very firstlings of my heart shall be
==146==The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
==147==To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
==148==The castle of Macduff I will surprise,
==149==Seize upon Fife, give to th’ edge o’ th’ sword
==150==His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
==151==That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
==152==This deed I’ll do before this purpose cool.
==153==But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?
==154==Come bring me where they are.

*Exeunt.*
