## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 7|← Act 1, Scene 7]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*The court of Macbeth’s castle.*

*Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch before him.*

**BAN.**
==1==How goes the night, boy?

**FLE.**
==2==The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

**BAN.**
==3==And she goes down at twelve.

**FLE.**
==3==                I take’t, ’tis later, sir.

**BAN.**
==4==Hold, take my sword. There’s husbandry in heaven,
==5==Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
*(Gives him his belt and dagger.)*
==6==A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
==7==And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,
==8==Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
==9==Gives way to in repose!
*(Enter Macbeth, and a Servant with a torch.)*
==9==              Give me my sword.
==10==Who’s there?

**MACB.**
==11==A friend.

**BAN.**
==12==What, sir, not yet at rest? The King’s a-bed.
==13==He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
==14==Sent forth great largess to your offices.
==15==This diamond he greets your wife withal,
==16==By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up
==17==In measureless content.

**MACB.**
==17==              Being unprepar’d,
==18==Our will became the servant to defect,
==19==Which else should free have wrought.

**BAN.**
==19==                     All’s well.
==20==I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
==21==To you they have show’d some truth.

**MACB.**
==21==                  I think not of them;
==22==Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve,
==23==We would spend it in some words upon that business,
==24==If you would grant the time.

**BAN.**
==24==                At your kind’st leisure.

**MACB.**
==25==If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis,
==26==It shall make honor for you.

**BAN.**
==26==                So I lose none
==27==In seeking to augment it, but still keep
==28==My bosom franchis’d and allegiance clear,
==29==I shall be counsell’d.

**MACB.**
==29==           Good repose the while!

**BAN.**
==30==Thanks, sir; the like to you!

*Exit Banquo with Fleance.*

**MACB.**
==31==Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
==32==She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==33==Is this a dagger which I see before me,
==34==The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:
==35==I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
==36==Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
==37==To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but
==38==A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
==39==Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
==40==I see thee yet, in form as palpable
==41==As this which now I draw.
==42==Thou marshal’st me the way that I was going,
==43==And such an instrument I was to use.
==44==Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses,
==45==Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still;
==46==And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
==47==Which was not so before. There’s no such thing:
==48==It is the bloody business which informs
==49==Thus to mine eyes. Now o’er the one half world
==50==Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
==51==The curtain’d sleep; witchcraft celebrates
==52==Pale Hecat’s off’rings; and wither’d Murder,
==53==Alarum’d by his sentinel, the wolf,
==54==Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
==55==With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design
==56==Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
==57==Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
==58==The very stones prate of my whereabout,
==59==And take the present horror from the time,
==60==Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
==61==Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
*(A bell rings.)*
==62==I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
==63==Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell,
==64==That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

*Exit.*
