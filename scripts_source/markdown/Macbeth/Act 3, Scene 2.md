## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Forres. The palace.*

*Enter Macbeth’s Lady and her Waiting Gentlewoman.*

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==1==Is Banquo gone from court?

**GENTLEW.**
==2==Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==3==Say to the King, I would attend his leisure
==4==For a few words.

**GENTLEW.**
==4==        Madam, I will.

*Exit.*

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==4==                Nought’s had, all’s spent,
==5==Where our desire is got without content;
==6==’Tis safer to be that which we destroy
==7==Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
*(Enter Macbeth.)*
==8==How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,
==9==Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
==10==Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
==11==With them they think on? Things without all remedy
==12==Should be without regard: what’s done, is done.

**K. MACB.**
==13==We have scorch’d the snake, not kill’d it;
==14==She’ll close and be herself, whilest our poor malice
==15==Remains in danger of her former tooth.
==16==But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,
==17==Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep
==18==In the affliction of these terrible dreams
==19==That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,
==20==Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
==21==Than on the torture of the mind to lie
==22==In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
==23==After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well.
==24==Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
==25==Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
==26==Can touch him further.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==26==              Come on;
==27==Gentle my lord, sleek o’er your rugged looks,
==28==Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.

**K. MACB.**
==29==So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.
==30==Let your remembrance apply to Banquo,
==31==Present him eminence both with eye and tongue:
==32==Unsafe the while, that we
==33==Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,
==34==And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
==35==Disguising what they are.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==35==              You must leave this.

**K. MACB.**
==36==O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
==37==Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==38==But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.

**K. MACB.**
==39==There’s comfort yet, they are assailable.
==40==Then be thou jocund; ere the bat hath flown
==41==His cloister’d flight, ere to black Hecat’s summons
==42==The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
==43==Hath rung night’s yawning peal, there shall be done
==44==A deed of dreadful note.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==44==              What’s to be done?

**K. MACB.**
==45==Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
==46==Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
==47==Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,
==48==And with thy bloody and invisible hand
==49==Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
==50==Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow
==51==Makes wing to th’ rooky wood;
==52==Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,
==53==Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.
==54==Thou marvel’st at my words, but hold thee still:
==55==Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
==56==So prithee go with me.

*Exeunt.*
