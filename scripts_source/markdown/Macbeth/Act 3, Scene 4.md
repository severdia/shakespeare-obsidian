## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*A room of state in the palace.*

*Banquet prepar’d.*

*Enter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Rosse, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.*

**K. MACB.**
==1== You know your own degrees, sit down. At first
==2== And last, the hearty welcome.

**LORD.**
==2==                 Thanks to your Majesty.

**K. MACB.**
==3== Ourself will mingle with society,
==4== And play the humble host.
==5== Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
==6== We will require her welcome.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==7== Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,
==8== For my heart speaks they are welcome.

*Enter First Murderer to the door.*

**K. MACB.**
==9== See, they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.
==10== Both sides are even; here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.
==11== Be large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measure
==12== The table round.⁠—
*(Goes to the door.)*
==13== There’s blood upon thy face.

**1. MUR.**
==13==                 ’Tis Banquo’s then.

**K. MACB.**
==14== ’Tis better thee without than he within.
==15== Is he dispatch’d?

**1. MUR.**
==15==         My lord, his throat is cut;
==16== That I did for him.

**K. MACB.**
==16==            Thou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats,
==17== Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance.
==18== If thou didst it, thou art the nonpareil.

**1. MUR.**
==19== Most royal sir, Fleance is scap’d.

**K. MACB.**
==20== Then comes my fit again. I had else been perfect,
==21== Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
==22== As broad and general as the casing air;
==23== But now I am cabin’d, cribb’d, confin’d, bound in
==24== To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?

**1. MUR.**
==25== Ay, my good lord; safe in a ditch he bides,
==26== With twenty trenched gashes on his head,
==27== The least a death to nature.

**K. MACB.**
==27==               Thanks for that:
==28== There the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fled
==29== Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
==30== No teeth for th’ present. Get thee gone; tomorrow
==31== We’ll hear ourselves again.

*Exit Murderer.*

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==31==                 My royal lord,
==32== You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold
==33== That is not often vouch’d, while ’tis a-making,
==34== ’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;
==35== From thence, the sauce to meat is ceremony,
==36== Meeting were bare without it.

*Enter the Ghost of Banquo and sits in Macbeth’s place.*

**K. MACB.**
==36==                 Sweet remembrancer!
==37== Now good digestion wait on appetite,
==38== And health on both!

**LEN.**
==38==            May’t please your Highness sit.

**K. MACB.**
==39== Here had we now our country’s honor roof’d,
==40== Were the grac’d person of our Banquo present,
==41== Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
==42== Than pity for mischance.

**ROSSE.**
==42==               His absence, sir,
==43== Lays blame upon his promise. Please’t your Highness
==44== To grace us with your royal company?

**K. MACB.**
==45== The table’s full.

**LEN.**
==45==         Here is a place reserv’d, sir.

**K. MACB.**
==46== Where?

**LEN.**
==47== Here, my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?

**K. MACB.**
==48== Which of you have done this?

**LORD.**
==48==                 What, my good lord?

**K. MACB.**
==49== Thou canst not say I did it; never shake
==50== Thy gory locks at me.

**ROSSE.**
==51== Gentlemen, rise, his Highness is not well.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==52== Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,
==53== And hath been from his youth. Pray you keep seat.
==54== The fit is momentary, upon a thought
==55== He will again be well. If much you note him,
==56== You shall offend him and extend his passion.
==57== Feed, and regard him not.—Are you a man?

**K. MACB.**
==58== Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
==59== Which might appall the devil.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==59==                 O proper stuff!
==60== This is the very painting of your fear;
==61== This is the air-drawn dagger which you said
==62== Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts
==63== (Impostors to true fear) would well become
==64== A woman’s story at a winter’s fire,
==65== Authoriz’d by her grandam. Shame itself,
==66== Why do you make such faces? When all’s done,
==67== You look but on a stool.

**K. MACB.**
==67==               Prithee see there!
==68== Behold! Look! Lo! How say you?
==69== Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
==70== If charnel-houses and our graves must send
==71== Those that we bury back, our monuments
==72== Shall be the maws of kites.

*Exit Ghost.*

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==72==                 What? Quite unmann’d in folly?

**K. MACB.**
==73== If I stand here, I saw him.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==73==               Fie, for shame!

**K. MACB.**
==74== Blood hath been shed ere now, i’ th’ olden time,
==75== Ere humane statute purg’d the gentle weal;
==76== Ay, and since too, murders have been perform’d
==77== Too terrible for the ear. The time has been,
==78== That when the brains were out, the man would die,
==79== And there an end; but now they rise again
==80== With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
==81== And push us from our stools. This is more strange
==82== Than such a murder is.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==82==               My worthy lord,
==83== Your noble friends do lack you.

**K. MACB.**
==83==                   I do forget.
==84== Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
==85== I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
==86== To those that know me. Come, love and health to all,
==87== Then I’ll sit down. Give me some wine, fill full.
*(Enter Ghost.)*
==88== I drink to th’ general joy o’ th’ whole table,
==89== And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
==90== Would he were here! To all, and him, we thirst,
==91== And all to all.

**LORD.**
==91==         Our duties, and the pledge.

**K. MACB.**
==92== Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!
==93== Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
==94== Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
==95== Which thou dost glare with!

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==95==               Think of this, good peers,
==96== But as a thing of custom. ’Tis no other;
==97== Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

**K. MACB.**
==98== What man dare, I dare.
==99== Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
==100== The arm’d rhinoceros, or th’ Hyrcan tiger,
==101== Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
==102== Shall never tremble. Or be alive again,
==103== And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
==104== If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
==105== The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
==106== Unreal mock’ry, hence!
*(Exit Ghost.)*
==106==               Why, so; being gone,
==107== I am a man again. Pray you sit still.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==108== You have displac’d the mirth, broke the good meeting,
==109== With most admir’d disorder.

**K. MACB.**
==109==                 Can such things be,
==110== And overcome us like a summer’s cloud,
==111== Without our special wonder? You make me strange
==112== Even to the disposition that I owe,
==113== When now I think you can behold such sights,
==114== And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
==115== When mine is blanch’d with fear.

**ROSSE.**
==115==                   What sights, my lord?

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==116== I pray you speak not. He grows worse and worse,
==117== Question enrages him. At once, good night.
==118== Stand not upon the order of your going,
==119== But go at once.

**LEN.**
==119==         Good night, and better health
==120== Attend his Majesty!

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==120==               A kind good night to all!

*Exeunt Lords and Attendants.*

**K. MACB.**
==121== It will have blood, they say; blood will have blood.
==122== Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
==123== Augures and understood relations have
==124== By maggot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
==125== The secret’st man of blood. What is the night?

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==126== Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

**K. MACB.**
==127== How say’st thou, that Macduff denies his person
==128== At our great bidding?

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==128==            Did you send to him, sir?

**K. MACB.**
==129== I hear it by the way; but I will send.
==130== There’s not a one of them but in his house
==131== I keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow
==132== (And betimes I will) to the weird sisters.
==133== More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
==134== By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good
==135== All causes shall give way. I am in blood
==136== Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more,
==137== Returning were as tedious as go o’er.
==138== Strange things I have in head, that will to hand,
==139== Which must be acted ere they may be scann’d.

**QUEEN. MACB.**
==140== You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

**K. MACB.**
==141== Come, we’ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
==142== Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
==143== We are yet but young in deed.

*Exeunt.*
