## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*The court of Macbeth’s castle.*

*Enter Lady Macbeth.*

**L. MACB.**
==1== That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
==2== What hath quench’d them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace!
==3== It was the owl that shriek’d, the fatal bellman,
==4== Which gives the stern’st good-night. He is about it:
==5== The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
==6== Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugg’d their possets,
==7== That death and nature do contend about them,
==8== Whether they live or die.

**MACB.**
*(Within.)*
==8==               Who’s there? What ho?

**L. MACB.**
==9== Alack, I am afraid they have awak’d,
==10== And ’tis not done; th’ attempt, and not the deed,
==11== Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready,
==12== He could not miss ’em. Had he not resembled
==13== My father as he slept, I had done’t.
*(Enter Macbeth.)*
==13==                   My husband!

**MACB.**
==14== I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?

**L. MACB.**
==15== I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
==16== Did not you speak?

**MACB.**
==16==            When?

**L. MACB.**
==16==                 Now.

**MACB.**
==16==                   As I descended?

**L. MACB.**
==17== Ay.

**MACB.**
==18== Hark! Who lies i’ th’ second chamber?

**L. MACB.**
==19== Donalbain.

**MACB.**
==19==         This is a sorry sight.

*Looking on his hands.*

**L. MACB.**
==20== A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

**MACB.**
==21== There’s one did laugh in ’s sleep, and one cried, “Murder!”
==22== That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them;
==23== But they did say their prayers, and address’d them
==24== Again to sleep.

**L. MACB.**
==24==         There are two lodg’d together.

**MACB.**
==25== One cried, “God bless us!” and “Amen!” the other,
==26== As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.
==27== List’ning their fear, I could not say “Amen,”
==28== When they did say “God bless us!”

**L. MACB.**
==28==                   Consider it not so deeply.

**MACB.**
==29== But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?
==30== I had most need of blessing, and “Amen”
==31== Stuck in my throat.

**L. MACB.**
==31==         These deeds must not be thought
==32== After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

**MACB.**
==33== Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
==34== Macbeth does murder sleep”—the innocent sleep,
==35== Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of care,
==36== The death of each day’s life, sore labor’s bath,
==37== Balm of hurt minds, great nature’s second course,
==38== Chief nourisher in life’s feast.

**L. MACB.**
==38==                 What do you mean?

**MACB.**
==39== Still it cried, “Sleep no more!” to all the house;
==40== “Glamis hath murder’d sleep, and therefore Cawdor
==41== Shall sleep no more—Macbeth shall sleep no more.”

**L. MACB.**
==42== Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
==43== You do unbend your noble strength, to think
==44== So brain-sickly of things. Go get some water,
==45== And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
==46== Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
==47== They must lie there. Go carry them, and smear
==48== The sleepy grooms with blood.

**MACB.**
==48==                 I’ll go no more.
==49== I am afraid to think what I have done;
==50== Look on’t again I dare not.

**L. MACB.**
==50==               Infirm of purpose!
==51== Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead
==52== Are but as pictures; ’tis the eye of childhood
==53== That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
==54== I’ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,
==55== For it must seem their guilt.

*Exit.*

*Knock within.*

**MACB.**
==55==               Whence is that knocking?
==56== How is’t with me, when every noise appalls me?
==57== What hands are here? Hah! They pluck out mine eyes.
==58== Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood
==59== Clean from my hand? No; this my hand will rather
==60== The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
==61== Making the green one red.

*Enter Lady Macbeth.*

**L. MACB.**
==62== My hands are of your color; but I shame
==63== To wear a heart so white.
*(Knock.)*
==63==               I hear a knocking
==64== At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.
==65== A little water clears us of this deed;
==66== How easy is it then! Your constancy
==67== Hath left you unattended.
*(Knock.)*
==67==               Hark, more knocking.
==68== Get on your night-gown, lest occasion call us
==69== And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
==70== So poorly in your thoughts.

**MACB.**
==71== To know my deed, ’twere best not know myself.
*(Knock.)*
==72== Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

*Exeunt.*
