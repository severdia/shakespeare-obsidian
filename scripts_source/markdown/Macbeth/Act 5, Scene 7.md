## Act 5, Scene 7
[[Act 5, Scene 6|← Act 5, Scene 6]] | [[Act 5, Scene 8|Act 5, Scene 8 →]]

*A part of the field.*

*Enter Macbeth.*

**K. MACB.**
==1== They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
==2== But bear-like I must fight the course. What’s he
==3== That was not born of woman? Such a one
==4== Am I to fear, or none.

*Enter Young Siward.*

**Y. SIW.**
==5== What is thy name?

**K. MACB.**
==5==            Thou’lt be afraid to hear it.

**Y. SIW.**
==6== No; though thou call’st thyself a hotter name
==7== Than any is in hell.

**K. MACB.**
==7==            My name’s Macbeth.

**Y. SIW.**
==8== The devil himself could not pronounce a title
==9== More hateful to mine ear.

**K. MACB.**
==9==               No; nor more fearful.

**Y. SIW.**
==10== Thou liest, abhorred tyrant, with my sword
==11== I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.

*Fight, and Young Siward slain.*

**K. MACB.**
==11==                 Thou wast born of woman.
==12== But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
==13== Brandish’d by man that’s of a woman born.

*Exit.*

*Alarums. Enter Macduff.*

**MACD.**
==14== That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
==15== If thou beest slain and with no stroke of mine,
==16== My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.
==17== I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
==18== Are hir’d to bear their staves; either thou, Macbeth,
==19== Or else my sword with an unbattered edge
==20== I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
==21== By this great clatter, one of greatest note
==22== Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!
==23== And more I beg not.

*Exit. Alarums.*

*Enter Malcolm and Siward.*

**SIW.**
==24== This way, my lord, the castle’s gently rend’red:
==25== The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight,
==26== The noble thanes do bravely in the war,
==27== The day almost itself professes yours,
==28== And little is to do.

**MAL.**
==28==            We have met with foes
==29== That strike beside us.

**SIW.**
==29==            Enter, sir, the castle.

*Exeunt. Alarum.*
