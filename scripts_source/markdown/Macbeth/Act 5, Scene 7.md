## Act 5, Scene 7
[[Act 5, Scene 6|← Act 5, Scene 6]] | [[Act 5, Scene 8|Act 5, Scene 8 →]]

*A part of the field.*

*Enter Macbeth.*

**K. MACB.**
They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
But bear-like I must fight the course. What’s he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.

*Enter Young Siward.*

**Y. SIW.**
What is thy name?

**K. MACB.**
           Thou’lt be afraid to hear it.

**Y. SIW.**
No; though thou call’st thyself a hotter name
Than any is in hell.

**K. MACB.**
           My name’s Macbeth.

**Y. SIW.**
The devil himself could not pronounce a title
More hateful to mine ear.

**K. MACB.**
              No; nor more fearful.

**Y. SIW.**
Thou liest, abhorred tyrant, with my sword
I’ll prove the lie thou speak’st.

*Fight, and Young Siward slain.*

**K. MACB.**
                Thou wast born of woman.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandish’d by man that’s of a woman born.

*Exit.*

*Alarums. Enter Macduff.*

**MACD.**
That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou beest slain and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hir’d to bear their staves; either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword with an unbattered edge
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!
And more I beg not.

*Exit. Alarums.*

*Enter Malcolm and Siward.*

**SIW.**
This way, my lord, the castle’s gently rend’red:
The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight,
The noble thanes do bravely in the war,
The day almost itself professes yours,
And little is to do.

**MAL.**
           We have met with foes
That strike beside us.

**SIW.**
           Enter, sir, the castle.

*Exeunt. Alarum.*
