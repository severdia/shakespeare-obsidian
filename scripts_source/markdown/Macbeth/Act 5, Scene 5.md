## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 6|Act 5, Scene 6 →]]

*Dunsinane. Within the castle.*

*Enter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with Drum and Colors.*

**K. MACB.**
==1==Hang out our banners on the outward walls,
==2==The cry is still, “They come!” Our castle’s strength
==3==Will laugh a siege to scorn; here let them lie
==4==Till famine and the ague eat them up.
==5==Were they not forc’d with those that should be ours,
==6==We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
==7==And beat them backward home.
*(A cry within of women.)*
==7==                  What is that noise?

**SEY.**
==8==It is the cry of women, my good lord.

*Exit.*

**K. MACB.**
==9==I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
==10==The time has been, my senses would have cool’d
==11==To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair
==12==Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
==13==As life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors;
==14==Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,
==15==Cannot once start me.
*(Enter Seyton.)*
==15==              Wherefore was that cry?

**SEY.**
==16==The Queen, my lord, is dead.

**K. MACB.**
==17==She should have died hereafter;
==18==There would have been a time for such a word.
==19==Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
==20==Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
==21==To the last syllable of recorded time;
==22==And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
==23==The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
==24==Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player,
==25==That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
==26==And then is heard no more. It is a tale
==27==Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
==28==Signifying nothing.
*(Enter Macbeth’s Messenger.)*
==28==           Thou com’st to use thy tongue;
==29==Thy story quickly.

**MACB. MESS.**
==29==           Gracious my lord,
==30==I should report that which I say I saw,
==31==But know not how to do’t.

**K. MACB.**
==31==              Well, say, sir.

**MACB. MESS.**
==32==As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
==33==I look’d toward Birnan, and anon methought
==34==The wood began to move.

**K. MACB.**
==34==              Liar and slave!

**MACB. MESS.**
==35==Let me endure your wrath, if’t be not so.
==36==Within this three mile may you see it coming;
==37==I say, a moving grove.

**K. MACB.**
==37==              If thou speak’st false,
==38==Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive,
==39==Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,
==40==I care not if thou dost for me as much.
==41==I pull in resolution, and begin
==42==To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend
==43==That lies like truth. “Fear not, till Birnan wood
==44==Do come to Dunsinane,” and now a wood
==45==Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
==46==If this which he avouches does appear,
==47==There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
==48==I gin to be a-weary of the sun,
==49==And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.
==50==Ring the alarum-bell! Blow wind, come wrack,
==51==At least we’ll die with harness on our back.

*Exeunt.*
