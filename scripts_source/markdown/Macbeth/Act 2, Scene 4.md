## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Outside Macbeth’s castle.*

*Enter Rosse with an Old Man.*

**OLD MAN.**
==1==Threescore and ten I can remember well,
==2==Within the volume of which time I have seen
==3==Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
==4==Hath trifled former knowings.

**ROSSE.**
==4==                Ha, good father,
==5==Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man’s act,
==6==Threatens his bloody stage. By th’ clock ’tis day,
==7==And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.
==8==Is’t night’s predominance, or the day’s shame,
==9==That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
==10==When living light should kiss it?

**OLD MAN.**
==10==                  ’Tis unnatural,
==11==Even like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday last,
==12==A falcon, tow’ring in her pride of place,
==13==Was by a mousing owl hawk’d at, and kill’d.

**ROSSE.**
==14==And Duncan’s horses (a thing most strange and certain),
==15==Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
==16==Turn’d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
==17==Contending ’gainst obedience, as they would make
==18==War with mankind.

**OLD MAN.**
==18==           ’Tis said, they eat each other.

**ROSSE.**
==19==They did so—to th’ amazement of mine eyes
==20==That look’d upon’t.
*(Enter Macduff.)*
==20==           Here comes the good Macduff.
==21==How goes the world, sir, now?

**MACD.**
==21==                  Why, see you not?

**ROSSE.**
==22==Is’t known who did this more than bloody deed?

**MACD.**
==23==Those that Macbeth hath slain.

**ROSSE.**
==23==                  Alas the day,
==24==What good could they pretend?

**MACD.**
==24==                  They were suborned.
==25==Malcolm and Donalbain, the King’s two sons,
==26==Are stol’n away and fled, which puts upon them
==27==Suspicion of the deed.

**ROSSE.**
==27==              ’Gainst nature still!
==28==Thriftless ambition, that will ravin up
==29==Thine own live’s means! Then ’tis most like
==30==The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

**MACD.**
==31==He is already nam’d, and gone to Scone
==32==To be invested.

**ROSSE.**
==32==        Where is Duncan’s body?

**MACD.**
==33==Carried to Colmekill,
==34==The sacred store-house of his predecessors
==35==And guardian of their bones.

**ROSSE.**
==35==                Will you to Scone?

**MACD.**
==36==No, cousin, I’ll to Fife.

**ROSSE.**
==36==              Well, I will thither.

**MACD.**
==37==Well, may you see things well done there: *adieu*,
==38==Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

**ROSSE.**
==39==Farewell, father.

**OLD MAN.**
==40==God’s benison go with you, and with those
==41==That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

*Exeunt omnes.*
