## Act 5, Scene 8
[[Act 5, Scene 7|← Act 5, Scene 7]] | [[Act 5, Scene 9|Act 5, Scene 9 →]]

*Another part of the field.*

*Enter Macbeth.*

**K. MACB.**
==1==Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
==2==On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes
==3==Do better upon them.

*Enter Macduff.*

**MACD.**
==3==           Turn, hell-hound, turn!

**K. MACB.**
==4==Of all men else I have avoided thee.
==5==But get thee back, my soul is too much charg’d
==6==With blood of thine already.

**MACD.**
==6==              I have no words,
==7==My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain
==8==Than terms can give thee out!

*Fight. Alarum.*

**K. MACB.**
==8==                Thou losest labor.
==9==As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
==10==With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.
==11==Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests,
==12==I bear a charmed life, which must not yield
==13==To one of woman born.

**MACD.**
==13==              Despair thy charm,
==14==And let the angel whom thou still hast serv’d
==15==Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother’s womb
==16==Untimely ripp’d.

**K. MACB.**
==17==Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
==18==For it hath cow’d my better part of man!
==19==And be these juggling fiends no more believ’d,
==20==That palter with us in a double sense,
==21==That keep the word of promise to our ear,
==22==And break it to our hope. I’ll not fight with thee.

**MACD.**
==23==Then yield thee, coward,
==24==And live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time!
==25==We’ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
==26==Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,
==27==“Here may you see the tyrant.”

**K. MACB.**
==27==                I will not yield,
==28==To kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feet,
==29==And to be baited with the rabble’s curse.
==30==Though Birnan wood be come to Dunsinane,
==31==And thou oppos’d, being of no woman born,
==32==Yet I will try the last. Before my body
==33==I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
==34==And damn’d be him that first cries, “Hold, enough!”

*Exeunt fighting. Alarums.*

*Enter fighting, and Macbeth slain. Macduff carries off Macbeth’s body.*
