## Act 5, Scene 9
[[Act 5, Scene 8|← Act 5, Scene 8]]

*Dunsinane. Within Macbeth’s castle.*

*Retreat and flourish. Enter, with Drum and Colors, Malcolm, Siward, Rosse, Thanes, and Soldiers.*

**MAL.**
==1==I would the friends we miss were safe arriv’d.

**SIW.**
==2==Some must go off; and yet, by these I see,
==3==So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

**MAL.**
==4==Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

**ROSSE.**
==5==Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier’s debt.
==6==He only liv’d but till he was a man,
==7==The which no sooner had his prowess confirm’d
==8==In the unshrinking station where he fought,
==9==But like a man he died.

**SIW.**
==9==              Then he is dead?

**ROSSE.**
==10==Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow
==11==Must not be measur’d by his worth, for then
==12==It hath no end.

**SIW.**
==12==        Had he his hurts before?

**ROSSE.**
==13==Ay, on the front.

**SIW.**
==13==        Why then. God’s soldier be he!
==14==Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
==15==I would not wish them to a fairer death.
==16==And so his knell is knoll’d.

**MAL.**
==16==              He’s worth more sorrow,
==17==And that I’ll spend for him.

**SIW.**
==18==He’s worth no more;
==19==They say he parted well, and paid his score,
==20==And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.

*Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head.*

**MACD.**
==21==Hail, King! For so thou art. Behold where stands
==22==Th’ usurper’s cursed head: the time is free.
==23==I see thee compass’d with thy kingdom’s pearl,
==24==That speak my salutation in their minds;
==25==Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
==26==Hail, King of Scotland!

**ALL.**
==26==              Hail, King of Scotland!

*Flourish.*

**K. MAL.**
==27==We shall not spend a large expense of time
==28==Before we reckon with your several loves,
==29==And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
==30==Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
==31==In such an honor nam’d. What’s more to do,
==32==Which would be planted newly with the time,
==33==As calling home our exil’d friends abroad
==34==That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,
==35==Producing forth the cruel ministers
==36==Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
==37==Who (as ’tis thought) by self and violent hands
==38==Took off her life; this, and what needful else
==39==That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
==40==We will perform in measure, time, and place.
==41==So thanks to all at once and to each one,
==42==Whom we invite to see us crown’d at Scone.

*Flourish. Exeunt omnes.*
