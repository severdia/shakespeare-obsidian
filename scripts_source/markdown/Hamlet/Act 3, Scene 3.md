## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Elsinore. A room in Elsinore castle.*

*Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.*

**KING.**
==1==I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
==2==To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you.
==3==I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
==4==And he to England shall along with you.
==5==The terms of our estate may not endure
==6==Hazard so near ’s as doth hourly grow
==7==Out of his brows.

**GUIL.**
==7==           We will ourselves provide.
==8==Most holy and religious fear it is
==9==To keep those many many bodies safe
==10==That live and feed upon your Majesty.

**ROS.**
==11==The single and peculiar life is bound
==12==With all the strength and armor of the mind
==13==To keep itself from noyance, but much more
==14==That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
==15==The lives of many. The cess of majesty
==16==Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
==17==What’s near it with it. Or it is a massy wheel
==18==Fix’d on the summit of the highest mount,
==19==To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
==20==Are mortis’d and adjoin’d, which when it falls,
==21==Each small annexment, petty consequence,
==22==Attends the boist’rous ruin. Never alone
==23==Did the King sigh, but with a general groan.

**KING.**
==24==Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage,
==25==For we will fetters put about this fear,
==26==Which now goes too free-footed.

**ROS.**
==26==                  We will haste us.

*Exeunt Gentlemen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.*

*Enter Polonius.*

**POL.**
==27==My lord, he’s going to his mother’s closet.
==28==Behind the arras I’ll convey myself
==29==To hear the process. I’ll warrant she’ll tax him home,
==30==And as you said, and wisely was it said,
==31==’Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
==32==Since nature makes them partial, should o’erhear
==33==The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege,
==34==I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed,
==35==And tell you what I know.

**KING.**
==35==              Thanks, dear my lord.
*(Exit Polonius.)*
==36==O, my offense is rank, it smells to heaven,
==37==It hath the primal eldest curse upon’t,
==38==A brother’s murder. Pray can I not,
==39==Though inclination be as sharp as will.
==40==My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
==41==And, like a man to double business bound,
==42==I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
==43==And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
==44==Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood,
==45==Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
==46==To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
==47==But to confront the visage of offense?
==48==And what’s in prayer but this twofold force,
==49==To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
==50==Or pardon’d being down? Then I’ll look up.
==51==My fault is past, but, O, what form of prayer
==52==Can serve my turn? “Forgive me my foul murder”?
==53==That cannot be, since I am still possess’d
==54==Of those effects for which I did the murder:
==55==My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
==56==May one be pardon’d and retain th’ offense?
==57==In the corrupted currents of this world
==58==Offense’s gilded hand may shove by justice,
==59==And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself
==60==Buys out the law, but ’tis not so above:
==61==There is no shuffling, there the action lies
==62==In his true nature, and we ourselves compell’d,
==63==Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
==64==To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
==65==Try what repentance can. What can it not?
==66==Yet what can it, when one can not repent?
==67==O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
==68==O limed soul, that struggling to be free
==69==Art more engag’d! Help, angels! Make assay,
==70==Bow, stubborn knees, and heart, with strings of steel,
==71==Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
==72==All may be well.

*He kneels.*

*Enter Hamlet.*

**HAM.**
==73==Now might I do it pat, now ’a is a-praying;
==74==And now I’ll do’t—and so ’a goes to heaven,
==75==And so am I reveng’d. That would be scann’d:
==76==A villain kills my father, and for that
==77==I, his sole son, do this same villain send
==78==To heaven.
==79==Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
==80==’A took my father grossly, full of bread,
==81==With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May,
==82==And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
==83==But in our circumstance and course of thought
==84==’Tis heavy with him. And am I then revenged,
==85==To take him in the purging of his soul,
==86==When he is fit and season’d for his passage?
==87==No!
==88==Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
==89==When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
==90==Or in th’ incestuous pleasure of his bed,
==91==At game a-swearing, or about some act
==92==That has no relish of salvation in’t⁠—
==93==Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
==94==And that his soul may be as damn’d and black
==95==As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays,
==96==This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

*Exit.*

**KING.**
*(Rising.)*
==97==My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
==98==Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

*Exit.*
