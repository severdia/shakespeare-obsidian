## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Near Elsinore. A plain in Denmark.*

*Enter Fortinbras with his army over the stage.*

**FORT.**
==1==Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king.
==2==Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
==3==Craves the conveyance of a promis’d march
==4==Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
==5==If that his Majesty would aught with us,
==6==We shall express our duty in his eye,
==7==And let him know so.

**CAP.**
==7==           I will do’t, my lord.

**FORT.**
==8==Go softly on.

*Exeunt all but the Captain.*

*Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, etc.*

**HAM.**
==9==Good sir, whose powers are these?

**CAP.**
==10==They are of Norway, sir.

**HAM.**
==11==How purpos’d, sir, I pray you?

**CAP.**
==12==Against some part of Poland.

**HAM.**
==13==Who commands them, sir?

**CAP.**
==14==The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.

**HAM.**
==15==Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
==16==Or for some frontier?

**CAP.**
==17==Truly to speak, and with no addition,
==18==We go to gain a little patch of ground
==19==That hath in it no profit but the name.
==20==To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
==21==Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
==22==A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

**HAM.**
==23==Why then the Polack never will defend it.

**CAP.**
==24==Yes, it is already garrison’d.

**HAM.**
==25==Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
==26==Will not debate the question of this straw.
==27==This is th’ imposthume of much wealth and peace,
==28==That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
==29==Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.

**CAP.**
==30==God buy you, sir.

*Exit.*

**ROS.**
==30==           Will’t please you go, my lord?

**HAM.**
==31==I’ll be with you straight—go a little before.
*(Exeunt all but Hamlet.)*
==32==How all occasions do inform against me,
==33==And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
==34==If his chief good and market of his time
==35==Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
==36==Sure He that made us with such large discourse,
==37==Looking before and after, gave us not
==38==That capability and godlike reason
==39==To fust in us unus’d. Now whether it be
==40==Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
==41==Of thinking too precisely on th’ event⁠—
==42==A thought which quarter’d hath but one part wisdom
==43==And ever three parts coward—I do not know
==44==Why yet I live to say, “This thing’s to do,”
==45==Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
==46==To do’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
==47==Witness this army of such mass and charge,
==48==Led by a delicate and tender prince,
==49==Whose spirit with divine ambition puff’d
==50==Makes mouths at the invisible event,
==51==Exposing what is mortal and unsure
==52==To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
==53==Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
==54==Is not to stir without great argument,
==55==But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
==56==When honor’s at the stake. How stand I then,
==57==That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d,
==58==Excitements of my reason and my blood,
==59==And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
==60==The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
==61==That for a fantasy and trick of fame
==62==Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
==63==Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
==64==Which is not tomb enough and continent
==65==To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
==66==My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

*Exit.*
