## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Elsinore. A room in Elsinore castle.*

*Enter King and Queen with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.*

**KING.**
==1==There’s matter in these sighs, these profound heaves⁠—
==2==You must translate, ’tis fit we understand them.
==3==Where is your son?

**QUEEN.**
==4==Bestow this place on us a little while.
*(Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.)*
==5==Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!

**KING.**
==6==What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

**QUEEN.**
==7==Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
==8==Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit,
==9==Behind the arras hearing something stir,
==10==Whips out his rapier, cries, “A rat, a rat!”
==11==And in this brainish apprehension kills
==12==The unseen good old man.

**KING.**
==12==              O heavy deed!
==13==It had been so with us had we been there.
==14==His liberty is full of threats to all,
==15==To you yourself, to us, to every one.
==16==Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer’d?
==17==It will be laid to us, whose providence
==18==Should have kept short, restrain’d, and out of haunt
==19==This mad young man; but so much was our love,
==20==We would not understand what was most fit,
==21==But like the owner of a foul disease,
==22==To keep it from divulging, let it feed
==23==Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?

**QUEEN.**
==24==To draw apart the body he hath kill’d,
==25==O’er whom his very madness, like some ore
==26==Among a mineral of metals base,
==27==Shows itself pure: ’a weeps for what is done.

**KING.**
==28==O Gertrude, come away!
==29==The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
==30==But we will ship him hence, and this vile deed
==31==We must with all our majesty and skill
==32==Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
*(Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.)*
==33==Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
==34==Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
==35==And from his mother’s closet hath he dragg’d him.
==36==Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the body
==37==Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
*(Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.)*
==38==Come, Gertrude, we’ll call up our wisest friends
==39==And let them know both what we mean to do
==40==And what’s untimely done. So envious slander,
==41==Whose whisper o’er the world’s diameter,
==42==As level as the cannon to his blank,
==43==Transports his pois’ned shot, may miss our name,
==44==And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
==45==My soul is full of discord and dismay.

*Exeunt.*
