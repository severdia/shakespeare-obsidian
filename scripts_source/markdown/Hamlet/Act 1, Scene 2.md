## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Elsinore. A room of state in the castle.*

*Flourish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen; Council: as Polonius; and his son Laertes, Hamlet, cum aliis including Voltemand and Cornelius.*

**KING.**
==1== Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death
==2== The memory be green, and that it us befitted
==3== To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
==4== To be contracted in one brow of woe,
==5== Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
==6== That we with wisest sorrow think on him
==7== Together with remembrance of ourselves.
==8== Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
==9== Th’ imperial jointress to this warlike state,
==10== Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy,
==11== With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
==12== With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
==13== In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
==14== Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr’d
==15== Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
==16== With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
==17== Now follows that you know young Fortinbras,
==18== Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
==19== Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death
==20== Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
==21== Co-leagued with this dream of his advantage,
==22== He hath not fail’d to pester us with message
==23== Importing the surrender of those lands
==24== Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
==25== To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
==26== Now for ourself, and for this time of meeting,
==27== Thus much the business is: we have here writ
==28== To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras⁠—
==29== Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
==30== Of this his nephew’s purpose—to suppress
==31== His further gait herein, in that the levies,
==32== The lists, and full proportions are all made
==33== Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
==34== You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,
==35== For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
==36== Giving to you no further personal power
==37== To business with the King, more than the scope
==38== Of these delated articles allow.
*(Giving a paper.)*
==39== Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

**BOTH COR. AND VOL.**
==40== In that, and all things, will we show our duty.

**KING.**
==41== We doubt it nothing; heartily farewell.
*(Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius.)*
==42== And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?
==43== You told us of some suit, what is’t, Laertes?
==44== You cannot speak of reason to the Dane
==45== And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
==46== That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
==47== The head is not more native to the heart,
==48== The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
==49== Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
==50== What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

**LAER.**
==50==                   My dread lord,
==51== Your leave and favor to return to France,
==52== From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
==53== To show my duty in your coronation,
==54== Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
==55== My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
==56== And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

**KING.**
==57== Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?

**POL.**
==58== H’ath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
==59== By laborsome petition, and at last
==60== Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent.
==61== I do beseech you give him leave to go.

**KING.**
==62== Take thy fair hour, Laertes, time be thine,
==63== And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
==64== But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son⁠—

**HAM.**
*(Aside.)*
==65== A little more than kin, and less than kind.

**KING.**
==66== How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

**HAM.**
==67== Not so, my lord, I am too much in the sun.

**QUEEN.**
==68== Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted color off,
==69== And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
==70== Do not forever with thy vailed lids
==71== Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
==72== Thou know’st ’tis common, all that lives must die,
==73== Passing through nature to eternity.

**HAM.**
==74== Ay, madam, it is common.

**QUEEN.**
==74==                 If it be,
==75== Why seems it so particular with thee?

**HAM.**
==76== Seems, madam? Nay, it is, I know not “seems.”
==77== ’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
==78== Nor customary suits of solemn black,
==79== Nor windy suspiration of forc’d breath,
==80== No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
==81== Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
==82== Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
==83== That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,
==84== For they are actions that a man might play,
==85== But I have that within which passes show,
==86== These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

**KING.**
==87== ’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
==88== To give these mourning duties to your father.
==89== But you must know your father lost a father,
==90== That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
==91== In filial obligation for some term
==92== To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
==93== In obstinate condolement is a course
==94== Of impious stubbornness, ’tis unmanly grief,
==95== It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
==96== A heart unfortified, or mind impatient,
==97== An understanding simple and unschool’d:
==98== For what we know must be, and is as common
==99== As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
==100== Why should we in our peevish opposition
==101== Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,
==102== A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
==103== To reason most absurd, whose common theme
==104== Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
==105== From the first corse till he that died today,
==106== “This must be so.” We pray you throw to earth
==107== This unprevailing woe, and think of us
==108== As of a father, for let the world take note
==109== You are the most immediate to our throne,
==110== And with no less nobility of love
==111== Than that which dearest father bears his son
==112== Do I impart toward you. For your intent
==113== In going back to school in Wittenberg,
==114== It is most retrograde to our desire,
==115== And we beseech you bend you to remain
==116== Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
==117== Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

**QUEEN.**
==118== Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet,
==119== I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.

**HAM.**
==120== I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

**KING.**
==121== Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply.
==122== Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
==123== This gentle and unforc’d accord of Hamlet
==124== Sits smiling to my heart, in grace whereof,
==125== No jocund health that Denmark drinks today,
==126== But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
==127== And the King’s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
==128== Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.

*Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.*

**HAM.**
==129== O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
==130== Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
==131== Or that the Everlasting had not fix’d
==132== His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! O God, God,
==133== How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
==134== Seem to me all the uses of this world!
==135== Fie on’t, ah fie! ’Tis an unweeded garden
==136== That grows to seed, things rank and gross in nature
==137== Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
==138== But two months dead, nay, not so much, not two.
==139== So excellent a king, that was to this
==140== Hyperion to a satyr, so loving to my mother
==141== That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
==142== Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth,
==143== Must I remember? Why, she should hang on him
==144== As if increase of appetite had grown
==145== By what it fed on, and yet, within a month⁠—
==146== Let me not think on’t! Frailty, thy name is woman!⁠—
==147== A little month, or ere those shoes were old
==148== With which she followed my poor father’s body,
==149== Like Niobe, all tears—why, she, even she⁠—
==150== O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason
==151== Would have mourn’d longer—married with my uncle,
==152== My father’s brother, but no more like my father
==153== Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
==154== Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
==155== Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
==156== She married—O most wicked speed: to post
==157== With such dexterity to incestuous sheets,
==158== It is not, nor it cannot come to good,
==159== But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue.

*Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Barnardo.*

**HOR.**
==160== Hail to your lordship!

**HAM.**
==160==            I am glad to see you well.
==161== Horatio—or I do forget myself.

**HOR.**
==162== The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

**HAM.**
==163== Sir, my good friend—I’ll change that name with you.
==164== And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
==165== Marcellus.

**MAR.**
==166== My good lord.

**HAM.**
==167== I am very glad to see you.
*(To Barnardo.)*
==168== Good even, sir.⁠—
==169== But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

**HOR.**
==170== A truant disposition, good my lord.

**HAM.**
==171== I would not hear your enemy say so,
==172== Nor shall you do my ear that violence
==173== To make it truster of your own report
==174== Against yourself. I know you are no truant.
==175== But what is your affair in Elsinore?
==176== We’ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

**HOR.**
==177== My lord, I came to see your father’s funeral.

**HAM.**
==178== I prithee do not mock me, fellow student,
==179== I think it was to see my mother’s wedding.

**HOR.**
==180== Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

**HAM.**
==181== Thrift, thrift, Horatio, the funeral bak’d-meats
==182== Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
==183== Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
==184== Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
==185== My father—methinks I see my father.

**HOR.**
==186== Where, my lord?

**HAM.**
==186==            In my mind’s eye, Horatio.

**HOR.**
==187== I saw him once, ’a was a goodly king.

**HAM.**
==188== ’A was a man, take him for all in all,
==189== I shall not look upon his like again.

**HOR.**
==190== My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

**HAM.**
==191== Saw, who?

**HOR.**
==192== My lord, the King your father.

**HAM.**
==192==                 The King my father?

**HOR.**
==193== Season your admiration for a while
==194== With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
==195== Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
==196== This marvel to you.

**HAM.**
==196==            For God’s love let me hear!

**HOR.**
==197== Two nights together had these gentlemen,
==198== Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watch,
==199== In the dead waste and middle of the night,
==200== Been thus encount’red: a figure like your father,
==201== Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
==202== Appears before them, and with solemn march
==203== Goes slow and stately by them; thrice he walk’d
==204== By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes
==205== Within his truncheon’s length, whilst they, distill’d
==206== Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
==207== Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
==208== In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
==209== And I with them the third night kept the watch,
==210== Where, as they had delivered, both in time,
==211== Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
==212== The apparition comes. I knew your father,
==213== These hands are not more like.

**HAM.**
==213==                 But where was this?

**MAR.**
==214== My lord, upon the platform where we watch.

**HAM.**
==215== Did you not speak to it?

**HOR.**
==215==               My lord, I did,
==216== But answer made it none. Yet once methought
==217== It lifted up it head and did address
==218== Itself to motion like as it would speak;
==219== But even then the morning cock crew loud,
==220== And at the sound it shrunk in haste away
==221== And vanish’d from our sight.

**HAM.**
==221==                 ’Tis very strange.

**HOR.**
==222== As I do live, my honor’d lord, ’tis true,
==223== And we did think it writ down in our duty
==224== To let you know of it.

**HAM.**
==225== Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
==226== Hold you the watch tonight?

**BOTH MAR. AND BAR.**
==226==                 We do, my lord.

**HAM.**
==227== Arm’d, say you?

**BOTH MAR. AND BAR.**
==228== Arm’d, my lord.

**HAM.**
==229== From top to toe?

**BOTH MAR. AND BAR.**
==229==            My lord, from head to foot.

**HAM.**
==230== Then saw you not his face.

**HOR.**
==231== O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.

**HAM.**
==232== What, look’d he frowningly?

**HOR.**
==232==                 A countenance more
==233== In sorrow than in anger.

**HAM.**
==233==               Pale, or red?

**HOR.**
==234== Nay, very pale.

**HAM.**
==234==         And fix’d his eyes upon you?

**HOR.**
==235== Most constantly.

**HAM.**
==235==         I would I had been there.

**HOR.**
==236== It would have much amaz’d you.

**HAM.**
==237== Very like, very like. Stay’d it long?

**HOR.**
==238== While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

**BOTH MAR. AND BAR.**
==239== Longer, longer.

**HOR.**
==240== Not when I saw’t.

**HAM.**
==240==            His beard was grisl’d, no?

**HOR.**
==241== It was, as I have seen it in his life,
==242== A sable silver’d.

**HAM.**
==242==         I will watch tonight,
==243== Perchance ’twill walk again.

**HOR.**
==243==               I warr’nt it will.

**HAM.**
==244== If it assume my noble father’s person,
==245== I’ll speak to it though hell itself should gape
==246== And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
==247== If you have hitherto conceal’d this sight,
==248== Let it be tenable in your silence still,
==249== And whatsomever else shall hap tonight,
==250== Give it an understanding but no tongue.
==251== I will requite your loves. So fare you well.
==252== Upon the platform ’twixt eleven and twelve
==253== I’ll visit you.

**HOR., MAR. AND BAR.**
==253==         Our duty to your honor.

**HAM.**
==254== Your loves, as mine to you; farewell.
*(Exeunt all but Hamlet.)*
==255== My father’s spirit—in arms! All is not well,
==256== I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
==257== Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,
==258== Though all the earth o’erwhelm them, to men’s eyes.

*Exit.*
