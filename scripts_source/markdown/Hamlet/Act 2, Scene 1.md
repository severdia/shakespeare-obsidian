## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Elsinore. A room in Polonius’ house.*

*Enter old Polonius with his man, Reynaldo.*

**POL.**
==1== Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

**REY.**
==2== I will, my lord.

**POL.**
==3== You shall do marvell’s wisely, good Reynaldo,
==4== Before you visit him, to make inquire
==5== Of his behavior.

**REY.**
==5==         My lord, I did intend it.

**POL.**
==6== Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
==7== Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,
==8== And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
==9== What company, at what expense; and finding
==10== By this encompassment and drift of question
==11== That they do know my son, come you more nearer
==12== Than your particular demands will touch it.
==13== Take you as ’twere some distant knowledge of him,
==14== As thus, “I know his father and his friends,
==15== And in part him.” Do you mark this, Reynaldo?

**REY.**
==16== Ay, very well, my lord.

**POL.**
==17== “And in part him—but,” you may say, “not well.
==18== But if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild,
==19== Addicted so and so,” and there put on him
==20== What forgeries you please: marry, none so rank
==21== As may dishonor him, take heed of that,
==22== But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
==23== As are companions noted and most known
==24== To youth and liberty.

**REY.**
==24==            As gaming, my lord.

**POL.**
==25== Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarreling,
==26== Drabbing—you may go so far.

**REY.**
==27== My lord, that would dishonor him.

**POL.**
==28== Faith, as you may season it in the charge:
==29== You must not put another scandal on him,
==30== That he is open to incontinency⁠—
==31== That’s not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
==32== That they may seem the taints of liberty,
==33== The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
==34== A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
==35== Of general assault.

**REY.**
==35==            But, my good lord⁠—

**POL.**
==36== Wherefore should you do this?

**REY.**
==36==                 Ay, my lord,
==37== I would know that.

**POL.**
==37==            Marry, sir, here’s my drift,
==38== And I believe it is a fetch of wit:
==39== You laying these slight sallies on my son,
==40== As ’twere a thing a little soil’d wi’ th’ working,
==41== Mark you,
==42== Your party in converse, him you would sound,
==43== Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
==44== The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur’d
==45== He closes with you in this consequence:
==46== “Good sir,” or so, or “friend,” or “gentleman,”
==47== According to the phrase or the addition
==48== Of man and country.

**REY.**
==48==            Very good, my lord.

**POL.**
==49== And then, sir, does ’a this—’a does—what was I
==50== About to say?
==51== By the mass, I was about to say something.
==52== Where did I leave?

**REY.**
==52==            At “closes in the consequence.”

**POL.**
==53== At “closes in the consequence,” ay, marry.
==54== He closes thus: “I know the gentleman.
==55== I saw him yesterday, or th’ other day,
==56== Or then, or then, with such or such, and as you say,
==57== There was ’a gaming, there o’ertook in ’s rouse,
==58== There falling out at tennis”; or, perchance,
==59== “I saw him enter such a house of sale,”
==60== *Videlicet*, a brothel, or so forth. See you now,
==61== Your bait of falsehood take this carp of truth,
==62== And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
==63== With windlasses and with assays of bias,
==64== By indirections find directions out;
==65== So by my former lecture and advice
==66== Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

**REY.**
==67== My lord, I have.

**POL.**
==67==            God buy ye, fare ye well.

**REY.**
==68== Good my lord.

**POL.**
==69== Observe his inclination in yourself.

**REY.**
==70== I shall, my lord.

**POL.**
==71== And let him ply his music.

**REY.**
==71==               Well, my lord.

**POL.**
==72== Farewell.
*(Exit Reynaldo.)*
*(Enter Ophelia.)*
==73== How now, Ophelia, what’s the matter?

**OPH.**
==74== O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

**POL.**
==75== With what, i’ th’ name of God?

**OPH.**
==76== My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
==77== Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac’d,
==78== No hat upon his head, his stockins fouled,
==79== Ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle,
==80== Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
==81== And with a look so piteous in purport
==82== As if he had been loosed out of hell
==83== To speak of horrors—he comes before me.

**POL.**
==84== Mad for thy love?

**OPH.**
==84==            My lord, I do not know,
==85== But truly I do fear it.

**POL.**
==85==            What said he?

**OPH.**
==86== He took me by the wrist, and held me hard,
==87== Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
==88== And with his other hand thus o’er his brow,
==89== He falls to such perusal of my face
==90== As ’a would draw it. Long stay’d he so.
==91== At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
==92== And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
==93== He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound
==94== As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
==95== And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
==96== And with his head over his shoulder turn’d,
==97== He seem’d to find his way without his eyes,
==98== For out a’ doors he went without their helps,
==99== And to the last bended their light on me.

**POL.**
==100== Come, go with me. I will go seek the king.
==101== This is the very ecstasy of love,
==102== Whose violent property fordoes itself,
==103== And leads the will to desperate undertakings
==104== As oft as any passions under heaven
==105== That does afflict our natures. I am sorry⁠—
==106== What, have you given him any hard words of late?

**OPH.**
==107== No, my good lord, but as you did command
==108== I did repel his letters, and denied
==109== His access to me.

**POL.**
==109==            That hath made him mad.
==110== I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
==111== I had not coted him. I fear’d he did but trifle
==112== And meant to wrack thee, but beshrew my jealousy!
==113== By heaven, it is as proper to our age
==114== To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions,
==115== As it is common for the younger sort
==116== To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king.
==117== This must be known, which, being kept close, might move
==118== More grief to hide, than hate to utter love.
==119== Come.

*Exeunt.*
