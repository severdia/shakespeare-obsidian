## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Elsinore. A platform before the castle.*

*Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two sentinels, meeting.*

**BAR.**
==1==Who’s there?

**FRAN.**
==2==Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.

**BAR.**
==3==Long live the King!

**FRAN.**
==4==Barnardo.

**BAR.**
==5==He.

**FRAN.**
==6==You come most carefully upon your hour.

**BAR.**
==7==’Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.

**FRAN.**
==8==For this relief much thanks. ’Tis bitter cold,
==9==And I am sick at heart.

**BAR.**
==10==Have you had quiet guard?

**FRAN.**
==10==              Not a mouse stirring.

**BAR.**
==11==Well, good night.
==12==If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
==13==The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

*Enter Horatio and Marcellus.*

**FRAN.**
==14==I think I hear them. Stand ho! Who is there?

**HOR.**
==15==Friends to this ground.

**MAR.**
==15==           And liegemen to the Dane.

**FRAN.**
==16==Give you good night.

**MAR.**
==16==           O, farewell, honest soldier.
==17==Who hath reliev’d you?

**FRAN.**
==17==           Barnardo hath my place.
==18==Give you good night.

*Exit Francisco.*

**MAR.**
==18==           Holla, Barnardo!

**BAR.**
==18==                         Say⁠—
==19==What, is Horatio there?

**HOR.**
==19==              A piece of him.

**BAR.**
==20==Welcome, Horatio, welcome, good Marcellus.

**HOR.**
==21==What, has this thing appear’d again tonight?

**BAR.**
==22==I have seen nothing.

**MAR.**
==23==Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,
==24==And will not let belief take hold of him
==25==Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us;
==26==Therefore I have entreated him along,
==27==With us to watch the minutes of this night,
==28==That if again this apparition come,
==29==He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

**HOR.**
==30==Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.

**BAR.**
==31==Sit down a while,
==32==And let us once again assail your ears,
==33==That are so fortified against our story,
==34==What we have two nights seen.

**HOR.**
==34==                Well, sit we down,
==35==And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.

**BAR.**
==36==Last night of all,
==37==When yond same star that’s westward from the pole
==38==Had made his course t’ illume that part of heaven
==39==Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
==40==The bell then beating one⁠—

*Enter Ghost.*

**MAR.**
==41==Peace, break thee off! Look where it comes again!

**BAR.**
==42==In the same figure like the King that’s dead.

**MAR.**
==43==Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio.

**BAR.**
==44==Looks ’a not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.

**HOR.**
==45==Most like; it harrows me with fear and wonder.

**BAR.**
==46==It would be spoke to.

**MAR.**
==46==           Speak to it, Horatio.

**HOR.**
==47==What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,
==48==Together with that fair and warlike form
==49==In which the majesty of buried Denmark
==50==Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak!

**MAR.**
==51==It is offended.

**BAR.**
==51==        See, it stalks away!

**HOR.**
==52==Stay! Speak, speak, I charge thee speak!

*Exit Ghost.*

**MAR.**
==53==’Tis gone, and will not answer.

**BAR.**
==54==How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
==55==Is not this something more than fantasy?
==56==What think you on’t?

**HOR.**
==57==Before my God, I might not this believe
==58==Without the sensible and true avouch
==59==Of mine own eyes.

**MAR.**
==59==           Is it not like the King?

**HOR.**
==60==As thou art to thyself.
==61==Such was the very armor he had on
==62==When he the ambitious Norway combated.
==63==So frown’d he once when in an angry parle
==64==He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
==65==’Tis strange.

**MAR.**
==66==Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
==67==With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

**HOR.**
==68==In what particular thought to work I know not,
==69==But in the gross and scope of mine opinion,
==70==This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

**MAR.**
==71==Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
==72==Why this same strict and most observant watch
==73==So nightly toils the subject of the land,
==74==And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
==75==And foreign mart for implements of war,
==76==Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
==77==Does not divide the Sunday from the week,
==78==What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
==79==Doth make the night joint-laborer with the day:
==80==Who is’t that can inform me?

**HOR.**
==80==                That can I,
==81==At least the whisper goes so: our last king,
==82==Whose image even but now appear’d to us,
==83==Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
==84==Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,
==85==Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
==86==(For so this side of our known world esteem’d him) 
==87==Did slay this Fortinbras, who, by a seal’d compact
==88==Well ratified by law and heraldy,
==89==Did forfeit (with his life) all those his lands
==90==Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror;
==91==Against the which a moi’ty competent
==92==Was gaged by our king, which had return’d
==93==To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
==94==Had he been vanquisher; as by the same comart
==95==And carriage of the article design’d,
==96==His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
==97==Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
==98==Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
==99==Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes
==100==For food and diet to some enterprise
==101==That hath a stomach in’t, which is no other,
==102==As it doth well appear unto our state,
==103==But to recover of us, by strong hand
==104==And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
==105==So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
==106==Is the main motive of our preparations,
==107==The source of this our watch, and the chief head
==108==Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

**BAR.**
==109==I think it be no other but e’en so.
==110==Well may it sort that this portentous figure
==111==Comes armed through our watch so like the King
==112==That was and is the question of these wars.

**HOR.**
==113==A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.
==114==In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
==115==A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
==116==The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
==117==Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.
==118==As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
==119==Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
==120==Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands
==121==Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.
==122==And even the like precurse of fear’d events,
==123==As harbingers preceding still the fates
==124==And prologue to the omen coming on,
==125==Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
==126==Unto our climatures and countrymen.
*(Enter Ghost.)*
==127==But soft, behold! Lo where it comes again!
*(It spreads his arms.)*
==128==I’ll cross it though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
==129==If thou hast any sound or use of voice,
==130==Speak to me.
==131==If there be any good thing to be done
==132==That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,
==133==Speak to me.
==134==If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,
==135==Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
==136==O speak!
==137==Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
==138==Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
==139==For which, they say, your spirits oft walk in death,
==140==Speak of it, stay and speak!
*(The cock crows.)*
==141==Stop it, Marcellus.

**MAR.**
==142==Shall I strike it with my partisan?

**HOR.**
==143==Do, if it will not stand.

**BAR.**
==143==           ’Tis here!

**HOR.**
==143==                  ’Tis here!

**MAR.**
==144==’Tis gone!
*(Exit Ghost.)*
==145==We do it wrong, being so majestical,
==146==To offer it the show of violence,
==147==For it is as the air, invulnerable,
==148==And our vain blows malicious mockery.

**BAR.**
==149==It was about to speak when the cock crew.

**HOR.**
==150==And then it started like a guilty thing
==151==Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
==152==The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
==153==Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
==154==Awake the god of day, and at his warning,
==155==Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
==156==Th’ extravagant and erring spirit hies
==157==To his confine; and of the truth herein
==158==This present object made probation.

**MAR.**
==159==It faded on the crowing of the cock.
==160==Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes
==161==Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,
==162==This bird of dawning singeth all night long,
==163==And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad,
==164==The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
==165==No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
==166==So hallowed, and so gracious, is that time.

**HOR.**
==167==So have I heard and do in part believe it.
==168==But look, the morn in russet mantle clad
==169==Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.
==170==Break we our watch up, and by my advice
==171==Let us impart what we have seen tonight
==172==Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,
==173==This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
==174==Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
==175==As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

**MAR.**
==176==Let’s do’t, I pray, and I this morning know
==177==Where we shall find him most convenient.

*Exeunt.*
