## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 7|Act 4, Scene 7 →]]

*Elsinore. Another room in Elsinore castle.*

*Enter Horatio and others.*

**HOR.**
What are they that would speak with me?

**GENT.**
Sea-faring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.

**HOR.**
Let them come in.
*(Exit Gentleman.)*
I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

*Enter Sailors.*

**1. SAIL.**
God bless you, sir.

**HOR.**
Let him bless thee too.

**1. SAIL.**
’A shall, sir, and ’t please him. There’s a letter for you, sir—it came from th’ ambassador that was bound for England—if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.

**HOR.**
*(Reads.)*
*“Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook’d this, give these fellows some means to the King, they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of ail, we put on a compell’d valor, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy, but they knew what they did: I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldest fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb, yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England, of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.*
*He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet.”*
Come, I will give you way for these your letters,
And do’t the speedier that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them.

*Exeunt.*
