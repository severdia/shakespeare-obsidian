## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Elsinore. Another part of the platform before Elsinore castle.*

*Enter Ghost and Hamlet.*

**HAM.**
==1==Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I’ll go no further.

**GHOST.**
==2==Mark me.

**HAM.**
==2==        I will.

**GHOST.**
==2==           My hour is almost come
==3==When I to sulph’rous and tormenting flames
==4==Must render up myself.

**HAM.**
==4==           Alas, poor ghost!

**GHOST.**
==5==Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
==6==To what I shall unfold.

**HAM.**
==6==           Speak, I am bound to hear.

**GHOST.**
==7==So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

**HAM.**
==8==What?

**GHOST.**
==9==I am thy father’s spirit,
==10==Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night,
==11==And for the day confin’d to fast in fires,
==12==Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
==13==Are burnt and purg’d away. But that I am forbid
==14==To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
==15==I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
==16==Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
==17==Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,
==18==Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
==19==And each particular hair to stand an end,
==20==Like quills upon the fearful porcupine.
==21==But this eternal blazon must not be
==22==To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
==23==If thou didst ever thy dear father love⁠—

**HAM.**
==24==O God!

**GHOST.**
==25==Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

**HAM.**
==26==Murder!

**GHOST.**
==27==Murder most foul, as in the best it is,
==28==But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.

**HAM.**
==29==Haste me to know’t, that I with wings as swift
==30==As meditation, or the thoughts of love,
==31==May sweep to my revenge.

**GHOST.**
==31==              I find thee apt,
==32==And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
==33==That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
==34==Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
==35==’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
==36==A serpent stung me, so the whole ear of Denmark
==37==Is by a forged process of my death
==38==Rankly abus’d; but know, thou noble youth,
==39==The serpent that did sting thy father’s life
==40==Now wears his crown.

**HAM.**
==40==           O my prophetic soul!
==41==My uncle?

**GHOST.**
==42==Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
==43==With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts⁠—
==44==O wicked wit and gifts that have the power
==45==So to seduce!—won to his shameful lust
==46==The will of my most seeming virtuous queen.
==47==O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there
==48==From me, whose love was of that dignity
==49==That it went hand in hand even with the vow
==50==I made to her in marriage, and to decline
==51==Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
==52==To those of mine!
==53==But virtue, as it never will be moved,
==54==Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
==55==So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d,
==56==Will sate itself in a celestial bed
==57==And prey on garbage.
==58==But soft, methinks I scent the morning air,
==59==Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
==60==My custom always of the afternoon,
==61==Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
==62==With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,
==63==And in the porches of my ears did pour
==64==The leperous distillment, whose effect
==65==Holds such an enmity with blood of man
==66==That swift as quicksilver it courses through
==67==The natural gates and alleys of the body,
==68==And with a sudden vigor it doth posset
==69==And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
==70==The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine,
==71==And a most instant tetter bark’d about,
==72==Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
==73==All my smooth body.
==74==Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand
==75==Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch’d,
==76==Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
==77==Unhous’led, disappointed, unanel’d,
==78==No reck’ning made, but sent to my account
==79==With all my imperfections on my head.
==80==O, horrible, O, horrible, most horrible!
==81==If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not,
==82==Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
==83==A couch for luxury and damned incest.
==84==But howsomever thou pursues this act,
==85==Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
==86==Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
==87==And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
==88==To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
==89==The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
==90==And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
==91==*Adieu, adieu, adieu!* Remember me.

*Exit.*

**HAM.**
==92==O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?
==93==And shall I couple hell? O fie, hold, hold, my heart,
==94==And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
==95==But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
==96==Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat
==97==In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
==98==Yea, from the table of my memory
==99==I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,
==100==All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past
==101==That youth and observation copied there,
==102==And thy commandment all alone shall live
==103==Within the book and volume of my brain,
==104==Unmix’d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
==105==O most pernicious woman!
==106==O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
==107==My tables—meet it is I set it down
==108==That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!
==109==At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.
*(He writes.)*
==110==So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
==111==It is “*Adieu, adieu*! Remember me.”
==112==I have sworn’t.

**HOR.**
*(Within.)*
==112==        My lord, my lord!

**MAR.**
*(Within.)*
==112==                  Lord Hamlet!

*Enter Horatio and Marcellus.*

**HOR.**
==112==                     Heavens secure him!

**HAM.**
==113==So be it!

**MAR.**
==114==Illo, ho, ho, my lord!

**HAM.**
==115==Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.

**MAR.**
==116==How is’t, my noble lord?

**HOR.**
==116==              What news, my lord?

**HAM.**
==117==O, wonderful!

**HOR.**
==118==Good my lord, tell it.

**HAM.**
==118==           No, you will reveal it.

**HOR.**
==119==Not I, my lord, by heaven.

**MAR.**
==119==              Nor I, my lord.

**HAM.**
==120==How say you then, would heart of man once think it?⁠—
==121==But you’ll be secret?

**BOTH HOR. AND MAR.**
==121==           Ay, by heaven, my lord.

**HAM.**
==122==There’s never a villain dwelling in all Denmark
==123==But he’s an arrant knave.

**HOR.**
==124==There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
==125==To tell us this.

**HAM.**
==125==        Why, right, you are in the right,
==126==And so, without more circumstance at all,
==127==I hold it fit that we shake hands and part,
==128==You, as your business and desire shall point you,
==129==For every man hath business and desire,
==130==Such as it is, and for my own poor part,
==131==I will go pray.

**HOR.**
==132==These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

**HAM.**
==133==I am sorry they offend you, heartily,
==134==Yes, faith, heartily.

**HOR.**
==134==           There’s no offense, my lord.

**HAM.**
==135==Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
==136==And much offense too. Touching this vision here,
==137==It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.
==138==For your desire to know what is between us,
==139==O’ermaster’t as you may. And now, good friends,
==140==As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
==141==Give me one poor request.

**HOR.**
==142==What is’t, my lord, we will.

**HAM.**
==143==Never make known what you have seen tonight.

**BOTH HOR. AND MAR.**
==144==My lord, we will not.

**HAM.**
==144==           Nay, but swear’t.

**HOR.**
==144==                     In faith,
==145==My lord, not I.

**MAR.**
==145==        Nor I, my lord, in faith.

**HAM.**
==146==Upon my sword.

**MAR.**
==146==        We have sworn, my lord, already.

**HAM.**
==147==Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

*Ghost cries under the stage.*

**GHOST.**
==148==Swear.

**HAM.**
==149==Ha, ha, boy, say’st thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?
==150==Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage,
==151==Consent to swear.

**HOR.**
==151==           Propose the oath, my lord.

**HAM.**
==152==Never to speak of this that you have seen,
==153==Swear by my sword.

**GHOST.**
*(Beneath.)*
==154==Swear.

**HAM.**
==155==*Hic et ubique?* Then we’ll shift our ground.
==156==Come hither, gentlemen,
==157==And lay your hands again upon my sword.
==158==Swear by my sword
==159==Never to speak of this that you have heard.

**GHOST.**
*(Beneath.)*
==160==Swear by his sword.

**HAM.**
==161==Well said, old mole, canst work i’ th’ earth so fast?
==162==A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.

**HOR.**
==163==O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

**HAM.**
==164==And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
==165==There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
==166==Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
==167==But come⁠—
==168==Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
==169==How strange or odd some’er I bear myself⁠—
==170==As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
==171==To put an antic disposition on⁠—
==172==That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
==173==With arms encumb’red thus, or this headshake,
==174==Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
==175==As “Well, well, we know,”or “We could, and if we would,”
==176==Or “If we list to speak,” or “There be, and if they might,”
==177==Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
==178==That you know aught of me—this do swear,
==179==So grace and mercy at your most need help you.

**GHOST.**
*(Beneath.)*
==180==Swear.

*They swear.*

**HAM.**
==181==Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! So, gentlemen,
==182==With all my love I do commend me to you,
==183==And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
==184==May do t’ express his love and friending to you,
==185==God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,
==186==And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
==187==The time is out of joint—O cursed spite,
==188==That ever I was born to set it right!
==189==Nay, come, let’s go together.

*Exeunt.*
