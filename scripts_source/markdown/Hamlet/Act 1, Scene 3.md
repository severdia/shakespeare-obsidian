## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Elsinore. A room in Polonius’ house.*

*Enter Laertes and Ophelia, his sister.*

**LAER.**
==1==My necessaries are inbark’d. Farewell.
==2==And, sister, as the winds give benefit
==3==And convey is assistant, do not sleep,
==4==But let me hear from you.

**OPH.**
==4==              Do you doubt that?

**LAER.**
==5==For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor,
==6==Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
==7==A violet in the youth of primy nature,
==8==Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
==9==The perfume and suppliance of a minute⁠—
==10==No more.

**OPH.**
==10==        No more but so?

**LAER.**
==10==                Think it no more:
==11==For nature crescent does not grow alone
==12==In thews and bulk, but as this temple waxes,
==13==The inward service of the mind and soul
==14==Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
==15==And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
==16==The virtue of his will, but you must fear,
==17==His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own,
==18==For he himself is subject to his birth:
==19==He may not, as unvalued persons do,
==20==Carve for himself, for on his choice depends
==21==The safety and health of this whole state,
==22==And therefore must his choice be circumscrib’d
==23==Unto the voice and yielding of that body
==24==Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
==25==It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
==26==As he in his particular act and place
==27==May give his saying deed, which is no further
==28==Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
==29==Then weigh what loss your honor may sustain
==30==If with too credent ear you list his songs,
==31==Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
==32==To his unmast’red importunity.
==33==Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
==34==And keep you in the rear of your affection,
==35==Out of the shot and danger of desire.
==36==The chariest maid is prodigal enough
==37==If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
==38==Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes.
==39==The canker galls the infants of the spring
==40==Too oft before their buttons be disclos’d,
==41==And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
==42==Contagious blastments are most imminent.
==43==Be wary then, best safety lies in fear:
==44==Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

**OPH.**
==45==I shall the effect of this good lesson keep
==46==As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
==47==Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
==48==Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
==49==Whiles, like a puff’d and reckless libertine,
==50==Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
==51==And recks not his own rede.

**LAER.**
==52==O, fear me not.
*(Enter Polonius.)*
==53==I stay too long—but here my father comes.
==54==A double blessing is a double grace,
==55==Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

**POL.**
==56==Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
==57==The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
==58==And you are stay’d for. There⁠—
*(Laying his hand on Laertes’ head.)*
==59==My blessing with thee!
==60==And these few precepts in thy memory
==61==Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
==62==Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.
==63==Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
==64==Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
==65==Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,
==66==But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
==67==Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d courage. Beware
==68==Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
==69==Bear’t that th’ opposed may beware of thee.
==70==Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,
==71==Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.
==72==Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
==73==But not express’d in fancy, rich, not gaudy,
==74==For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
==75==And they in France of the best rank and station
==76==Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
==77==Neither a borrower nor a lender be,
==78==For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
==79==And borrowing dulleth th’ edge of husbandry.
==80==This above all: to thine own self be true,
==81==And it must follow, as the night the day,
==82==Thou canst not then be false to any man.
==83==Farewell, my blessing season this in thee!

**LAER.**
==84==Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

**POL.**
==85==The time invests you, go, your servants tend.

**LAER.**
==86==Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
==87==What I have said to you.

**OPH.**
==87==              ’Tis in my memory lock’d,
==88==And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

**LAER.**
==89==Farewell.

*Exit Laertes.*

**POL.**
==90==What is’t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

**OPH.**
==91==So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

**POL.**
==92==Marry, well bethought.
==93==’Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
==94==Given private time to you, and you yourself
==95==Have of your audience been most free and bounteous.
==96==If it be so—as so ’tis put on me,
==97==And that in way of caution—I must tell you,
==98==You do not understand yourself so clearly
==99==As it behooves my daughter and your honor.
==100==What is between you? Give me up the truth.

**OPH.**
==101==He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
==102==Of his affection to me.

**POL.**
==103==Affection, puh! You speak like a green girl,
==104==Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
==105==Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

**OPH.**
==106==I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

**POL.**
==107==Marry, I will teach you: think yourself a baby
==108==That you have ta’en these tenders for true pay,
==109==Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
==110==Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
==111==Wringing it thus) you’ll tender me a fool.

**OPH.**
==112==My lord, he hath importun’d me with love
==113==In honorable fashion.

**POL.**
==114==Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to.

**OPH.**
==115==And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
==116==With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

**POL.**
==117==Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
==118==When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
==119==Lends the tongue vows. These blazes, daughter,
==120==Giving more light than heat, extinct in both
==121==Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
==122==You must not take for fire. From this time
==123==Be something scanter of your maiden presence,
==124==Set your entreatments at a higher rate
==125==Than a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet,
==126==Believe so much in him, that he is young,
==127==And with a larger tether may he walk
==128==Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
==129==Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,
==130==Not of that dye which their investments show,
==131==But mere implorators of unholy suits,
==132==Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,
==133==The better to beguile. This is for all:
==134==I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
==135==Have you so slander any moment leisure
==136==As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
==137==Look to’t, I charge you. Come your ways.

**OPH.**
==138==I shall obey, my lord.

*Exeunt.*
