## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 1, Scene 5|Act 1, Scene 5 →]]

*Elsinore. A platform before Elsinore castle.*

*Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.*

**HAM.**
==1==The air bites shrewdly, it is very cold.

**HOR.**
==2==It is a nipping and an eager air.

**HAM.**
==3==What hour now?

**HOR.**
==3==           I think it lacks of twelve.

**MAR.**
==4==No, it is struck.

**HOR.**
==5==Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the season
==6==Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
*(A flourish of trumpets, and two pieces goes off within.)*
==7==What does this mean, my lord?

**HAM.**
==8==The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,
==9==Keeps wassail, and the swagg’ring up-spring reels;
==10==And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
==11==The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
==12==The triumph of his pledge.

**HOR.**
==12==              Is it a custom?

**HAM.**
==13==Ay, marry, is’t,
==14==But to my mind, though I am native here
==15==And to the manner born, it is a custom
==16==More honor’d in the breach than the observance.
==17==This heavy-headed revel east and west
==18==Makes us traduc’d and tax’d of other nations.
==19==They clip us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
==20==Soil our addition, and indeed it takes
==21==From our achievements, though perform’d at height,
==22==The pith and marrow of our attribute.
==23==So, oft it chances in particular men,
==24==That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
==25==As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty
==26==(Since nature cannot choose his origin),
==27==By their o’ergrowth of some complexion
==28==Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
==29==Or by some habit, that too much o’er-leavens
==30==The form of plausive manners—that these men,
==31==Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
==32==Being nature’s livery, or fortune’s star,
==33==His virtues else, be they as pure as grace,
==34==As infinite as man may undergo,
==35==Shall in the general censure take corruption
==36==From that particular fault: the dram of ev’l
==37==Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
==38==To his own scandal.

*Enter Ghost.*

**HOR.**
==38==           Look, my lord, it comes!

**HAM.**
==39==Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
==40==Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn’d,
==41==Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell,
==42==Be thy intents wicked, or charitable,
==43==Thou com’st in such a questionable shape
==44==That I will speak to thee. I’ll call thee Hamlet,
==45==King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me!
==46==Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
==47==Why thy canoniz’d bones, hearsed in death,
==48==Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
==49==Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn’d,
==50==Hath op’d his ponderous and marble jaws
==51==To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
==52==That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
==53==Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
==54==Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
==55==So horridly to shake our disposition
==56==With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
==57==Say why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?

*Ghost beckons Hamlet.*

**HOR.**
==58==It beckons you to go away with it,
==59==As if it some impartment did desire
==60==To you alone.

**MAR.**
==60==        Look with what courteous action
==61==It waves you to a more removed ground,
==62==But do not go with it.

**HOR.**
==62==           No, by no means.

**HAM.**
==63==It will not speak, then I will follow it.

**HOR.**
==64==Do not, my lord.

**HAM.**
==64==           Why, what should be the fear?
==65==I do not set my life at a pin’s fee,
==66==And for my soul, what can it do to that,
==67==Being a thing immortal as itself?
==68==It waves me forth again, I’ll follow it.

**HOR.**
==69==What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
==70==Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
==71==That beetles o’er his base into the sea,
==72==And there assume some other horrible form
==73==Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
==74==And draw you into madness? Think of it.
==75==The very place puts toys of desperation,
==76==Without more motive, into every brain
==77==That looks so many fathoms to the sea
==78==And hears it roar beneath.

**HAM.**
==78==              It waves me still.⁠—
==79==Go on, I’ll follow thee.

**MAR.**
==80==You shall not go, my lord.

**HAM.**
==80==              Hold off your hands.

**HOR.**
==81==Be rul’d, you shall not go.

**HAM.**
==81==              My fate cries out,
==82==And makes each petty artere in this body
==83==As hardy as the Nemean lion’s nerve.
==84==Still am I call’d. Unhand me, gentlemen.
==85==By heaven, I’ll make a ghost of him that lets me!
==86==I say away!—Go on, I’ll follow thee.

*Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.*

**HOR.**
==87==He waxes desperate with imagination.

**MAR.**
==88==Let’s follow. ’Tis not fit thus to obey him.

**HOR.**
==89==Have after. To what issue will this come?

**MAR.**
==90==Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

**HOR.**
==91==Heaven will direct it.

**MAR.**
==91==           Nay, let’s follow him.

*Exeunt.*
