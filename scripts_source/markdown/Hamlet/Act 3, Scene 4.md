## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Elsinore. The Queen’s room in Elsinore castle.*

*Enter Queen Gertrude and Polonius.*

**POL.**
==1== ’A will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
==2== Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
==3== And that your Grace hath screen’d and stood between
==4== Much heat and him. I’ll silence me even here;
==5== Pray you be round with him.

**QUEEN.**
==6== I’ll warr’nt you, fear me not. Withdraw,
==7== I hear him coming.

*Polonius hides behind the arras.*

*Enter Hamlet.*

**HAM.**
==8== Now, mother, what’s the matter?

**QUEEN.**
==9== Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

**HAM.**
==10== Mother, you have my father much offended.

**QUEEN.**
==11== Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

**HAM.**
==12== Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

**QUEEN.**
==13== Why, how now, Hamlet?

**HAM.**
==13==               What’s the matter now?

**QUEEN.**
==14== Have you forgot me?

**HAM.**
==14==            No, by the rood, not so:
==15== You are the Queen, your husband’s brother’s wife,
==16== And would it were not so, you are my mother.

**QUEEN.**
==17== Nay, then I’ll set those to you that can speak.

**HAM.**
==18== Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge;
==19== You go not till I set you up a glass
==20== Where you may see the inmost part of you.

**QUEEN.**
==21== What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?
==22== Help ho!

**POL.**
*(Behind.)*
==23== What ho, help!

**HAM.**
*(Drawing.)*
==24== How now? A rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!

*Kills Polonius through the arras.*

**POL.**
*(Behind.)*
==25== O, I am slain.

**QUEEN.**
==25==         O me, what hast thou done?

**HAM.**
==26== Nay, I know not, is it the King?

**QUEEN.**
==27== O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

**HAM.**
==28== A bloody deed! Almost as bad, good mother,
==29== As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

**QUEEN.**
==30== As kill a king!

**HAM.**
==30==         Ay, lady, it was my word.
*(Parts the arras and discovers Polonius.)*
==31== Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
==32== I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune;
==33== Thou find’st to be too busy is some danger.⁠—
==34== Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,
==35== And let me wring your heart, for so I shall
==36== If it be made of penetrable stuff,
==37== If damned custom have not brass’d it so
==38== That it be proof and bulwark against sense.

**QUEEN.**
==39== What have I done, that thou dar’st wag thy tongue
==40== In noise so rude against me?

**HAM.**
==40==                 Such an act
==41== That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
==42== Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
==43== From the fair forehead of an innocent love
==44== And sets a blister there, makes marriage vows
==45== As false as dicers’ oaths, O, such a deed
==46== As from the body of contraction plucks
==47== The very soul, and sweet religion makes
==48== A rhapsody of words. Heaven’s face does glow
==49== O’er this solidity and compound mass
==50== With heated visage, as against the doom;
==51== Is thought-sick at the act.

**QUEEN.**
==51==               Ay me, what act,
==52== That roars so loud and thunders in the index?

**HAM.**
==53== Look here upon this picture, and on this,
==54== The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
==55== See what a grace was seated on this brow:
==56== Hyperion’s curls, the front of Jove himself,
==57== An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,
==58== A station like the herald Mercury
==59== New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,
==60== A combination and a form indeed,
==61== Where every god did seem to set his seal
==62== To give the world assurance of a man.
==63== This was your husband. Look you now what follows:
==64== Here is your husband, like a mildewed ear,
==65== Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
==66== Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
==67== And batten on this moor? Ha, have you eyes?
==68== You cannot call it love, for at your age
==69== The heyday in the blood is tame, it’s humble,
==70== And waits upon the judgment, and what judgment
==71== Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
==72== Else could you not have motion, but sure that sense
==73== Is apoplex’d, for madness would not err,
==74== Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thrall’d
==75== But it reserv’d some quantity of choice
==76== To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t
==77== That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?
==78== Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
==79== Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
==80== Or but a sickly part of one true sense
==81== Could not so mope. O shame, where is thy blush?
==82== Rebellious hell,
==83== If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,
==84== To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
==85== And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
==86== When the compulsive ardor gives the charge,
==87== Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
==88== And reason panders will.

**QUEEN.**
==88==               O Hamlet, speak no more!
==89== Thou turn’st my eyes into my very soul,
==90== And there I see such black and grained spots
==91== As will not leave their tinct.

**HAM.**
==91==                 Nay, but to live
==92== In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
==93== Stew’d in corruption, honeying and making love
==94== Over the nasty sty!

**QUEEN.**
==94==            O, speak to me no more!
==95== These words like daggers enter in my ears.
==96== No more, sweet Hamlet!

**HAM.**
==96==               A murderer and a villain!
==97== A slave that is not twentith part the tithe
==98== Of your precedent lord, a Vice of kings,
==99== A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
==100== That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
==101== And put it in his pocket⁠—

**QUEEN.**
==101==               No more!

*Enter Ghost in his night-gown.*

**HAM.**
==102== A king of shreds and patches⁠—
==103== Save me, and hover o’er me with your wings,
==104== You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

**QUEEN.**
==105== Alas, he’s mad!

**HAM.**
==106== Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
==107== That, laps’d in time and passion, lets go by
==108== Th’ important acting of your dread command?
==109== O, say!

**GHOST.**
==110== Do not forget! This visitation
==111== Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
==112== But look, amazement on thy mother sits,
==113== O, step between her and her fighting soul.
==114== Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works,
==115== Speak to her, Hamlet.

**HAM.**
==115==            How is it with you, lady?

**QUEEN.**
==116== Alas, how is’t with you,
==117== That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
==118== And with th’ incorporal air do hold discourse?
==119== Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,
==120== And as the sleeping soldiers in th’ alarm,
==121== Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
==122== Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
==123== Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
==124== Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?

**HAM.**
==125== On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
==126== His form and cause conjoin’d, preaching to stones,
==127== Would make them capable.—Do not look upon me,
==128== Lest with this piteous action you convert
==129== My stern effects, then what I have to do
==130== Will want true color—tears perchance for blood.

**QUEEN.**
==131== To whom do you speak this?

**HAM.**
==131==               Do you see nothing there?

**QUEEN.**
==132== Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.

**HAM.**
==133== Nor did you nothing hear?

**QUEEN.**
==133==               No, nothing but ourselves.

**HAM.**
==134== Why, look you there, look how it steals away!
==135== My father, in his habit as he lived!
==136== Look where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

*Exit Ghost.*

**QUEEN.**
==137== This is the very coinage of your brain,
==138== This bodiless creation ecstasy
==139== Is very cunning in.

**HAM.**
==139==            Ecstasy?
==140== My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,
==141== And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
==142== That I have utt’red. Bring me to the test,
==143== And I the matter will reword, which madness
==144== Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
==145== Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,
==146== That not your trespass but my madness speaks;
==147== It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
==148== Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
==149== Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,
==150== Repent what’s past, avoid what is to come,
==151== And do not spread the compost on the weeds
==152== To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue,
==153== For in the fatness of these pursy times
==154== Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
==155== Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

**QUEEN.**
==156== O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

**HAM.**
==157== O, throw away the worser part of it,
==158== And live the purer with the other half.
==159== Good night, but go not to my uncle’s bed⁠—
==160== Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
==161== That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
==162== Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
==163== That to the use of actions fair and good
==164== He likewise gives a frock or livery
==165== That aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,
==166== And that shall lend a kind of easiness
==167== To the next abstinence, the next more easy;
==168== For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
==169== And either lodge the devil or throw him out
==170== With wondrous potency. Once more good night,
==171== And when you are desirous to be blest,
==172== I’ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
*(Pointing to Polonius.)*
==173== I do repent; but heaven hath pleas’d it so
==174== To punish me with this, and this with me,
==175== That I must be their scourge and minister.
==176== I will bestow him, and will answer well
==177== The death I gave him. So again good night.
==178== I must be cruel only to be kind.
==179== This bad begins and worse remains behind.
==180== One word more, good lady.

**QUEEN.**
==180==               What shall I do?

**HAM.**
==181== Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
==182== Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed,
==183== Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,
==184== And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
==185== Or paddling in your neck with his damn’d fingers,
==186== Make you to ravel all this matter out,
==187== That I essentially am not in madness,
==188== But mad in craft. ’Twere good you let him know,
==189== For who that’s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
==190== Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
==191== Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
==192== No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
==193== Unpeg the basket on the house’s top,
==194== Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
==195== To try conclusions in the basket creep,
==196== And break your own neck down.

**QUEEN.**
==197== Be thou assur’d, if words be made of breath,
==198== And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
==199== What thou hast said to me.

**HAM.**
==200== I must to England, you know that?

**QUEEN.**
==200==                   Alack,
==201== I had forgot. ’Tis so concluded on.

**HAM.**
==202== There’s letters seal’d, and my two schoolfellows,
==203== Whom I will trust as I will adders fang’d,
==204== They bear the mandate, they must sweep my way
==205== And marshal me to knavery. Let it work,
==206== For ’tis the sport to have the enginer
==207== Hoist with his own petar, an’t shall go hard
==208== But I will delve one yard below their mines,
==209== And blow them at the moon. O, ’tis most sweet
==210== When in one line two crafts directly meet.
==211== This man shall set me packing;
==212== I’ll lug the guts into the neighbor room.
==213== Mother, good night indeed. This counsellor
==214== Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
==215== Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
==216== Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
==217== Good night, mother.

*Exeunt severally, Hamlet tugging in Polonius.*
