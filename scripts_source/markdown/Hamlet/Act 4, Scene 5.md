## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Elsinore. A room in Elsinore castle.*

*Enter Horatio, Queen Gertrude, and a Gentleman.*

**QUEEN.**
==1==I will not speak with her.

**GENT.**
==2==She is importunate, indeed distract.
==3==Her mood will needs be pitied.

**QUEEN.**
==3==                What would she have?

**GENT.**
==4==She speaks much of her father, says she hears
==5==There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her heart,
==6==Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt
==7==That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
==8==Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
==9==The hearers to collection; they yawn at it,
==10==And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,
==11==Which as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
==12==Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
==13==Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

**HOR.**
==14==’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew
==15==Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

**QUEEN.**
==16==Let her come in.
*(Exit Gentleman.)*
*(Aside.)*
==17==To my sick soul, as sin’s true nature is,
==18==Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss,
==19==So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
==20==It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

*Enter Ophelia distracted, with her hair down, playing on a lute.*

**OPH.**
==21==Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

**QUEEN.**
==22==How now, Ophelia?

**OPH.**
*(She sings.)*
==23==*“How should I your true-love know*
==24==*From another one?*
==25==*By his cockle hat and staff,*
==26==*And his sandal shoon.”*

**QUEEN.**
==27==Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

**OPH.**
==28==Say you? Nay, pray you mark.
*(Song.)*
==29==*“He is dead and gone, lady,*
==30==*He is dead and gone,*
==31==*At his head a grass-green turf,*
==32==*At his heels a stone.”*
==33==O ho!

**QUEEN.**
==34==Nay, but, Ophelia⁠—

**OPH.**
==35==Pray you mark.
*(Sings.)*
==36==*“White his shroud as the mountain snow”⁠—*

*Enter King.*

**QUEEN.**
==37==Alas, look here, my lord.

**OPH.**
*(Song.)*
==38==*“Larded all with sweet flowers,*
==39==*Which bewept to the ground did not go*
==40==*With true-love showers.”*

**KING.**
==41==How do you, pretty lady?

**OPH.**
==42==Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker’s daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!

**KING.**
==43==Conceit upon her father.

**OPH.**
==44==Pray let’s have no words of this, but when they ask you what it means, say you this:
*(Song.)*
==45==*“Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,*
==46==*All in the morning betime,*
==47==*And I a maid at your window,*
==48==*To be your Valentine.*
==49==*Then up he rose and donn’d his clo’es,*
==50==*And dupp’d the chamber-door,*
==51==*Let in the maid, that out a maid*
==52==*Never departed more.”*

**KING.**
==53==Pretty Ophelia!

**OPH.**
==54==Indeed without an oath I’ll make an end on’t.
*(Sings.)*
==55==*“By Gis, and by Saint Charity,*
==56==*Alack, and fie for shame!*
==57==*Young men will do’t if they come to’t,*
==58==*By Cock, they are to blame.*
==59==*Quoth she, “Before you tumbled me,*
==60==*You promis’d me to wed.’”*
*(He answers.)*
"Then he goes,"==61==*“‘So would I ’a’ done, by yonder sun,*
==62==*And thou hadst not come to my bed.’”*

**KING.**
==63==How long hath she been thus?

**OPH.**
==64==I hope all will be well. We must be patient, but I cannot choose but weep to think they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of it, and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies, good night. Sweet ladies, good night, good night.

*Exit.*

**KING.**
==65==Follow her close, give her good watch, I pray you.
*(Exit Horatio.)*
==66==O, this is the poison of deep grief, it springs
==67==All from her father’s death—and now behold!
==68==O Gertrude, Gertrude,
==69==When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
==70==But in battalions: first, her father slain;
==71==Next, your son gone, and he most violent author
==72==Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
==73==Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
==74==For good Polonius’ death; and we have done but greenly
==75==In hugger-mugger to inter him; poor Ophelia
==76==Divided from herself and her fair judgement,
==77==Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts;
==78==Last, and as much containing as all these,
==79==Her brother is in secret come from France,
==80==Feeds on this wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
==81==And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
==82==With pestilent speeches of his father’s death,
==83==Wherein necessity, of matter beggar’d,
==84==Will nothing stick our person to arraign
==85==In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
==86==Like to a murd’ring-piece, in many places
==87==Gives me superfluous death.

*A noise within.*

**QUEEN.**
==87==                Alack, what noise is this?

**KING.**
==88==Attend!
==89==Where is my Swissers? Let them guard the door.
*(Enter a Messenger.)*
==90==What is the matter?

**MESS.**
==90==           Save yourself, my lord!
==91==The ocean, overpeering of his list,
==92==Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
==93==Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
==94==O’erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord,
==95==And as the world were now but to begin,
==96==Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
==97==The ratifiers and props of every word,
==98==They cry, “Choose we, Laertes shall be king!”
==99==Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
==100==“Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!”

*A noise within.*

**QUEEN.**
==101==How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
==102==O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!

*Enter Laertes with others.*

**KING.**
==103==The doors are broke.

**LAER.**
==104==Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.

**LAER. FOL.**
==105==No, let ’s come in.

**LAER.**
==105==           I pray you give me leave.

**LAER. FOL.**
==106==We will, we will.

**LAER.**
==107==I thank you, keep the door.
*(Exeunt Laertes’ followers.)*
==108==O thou vile king,
==109==Give me my father!

**QUEEN.**
==109==           Calmly, good Laertes.

**LAER.**
==110==That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard,
==111==Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
==112==Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow
==113==Of my true mother.

**KING.**
==113==           What is the cause, Laertes,
==114==That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
==115==Let him go, Gertrude, do not fear our person:
==116==There’s such divinity doth hedge a king
==117==That treason can but peep to what it would,
==118==Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
==119==Why thou art thus incens’d. Let him go, Gertrude.
==120==Speak, man.

**LAER.**
==121==Where is my father?

**KING.**
==121==           Dead.

**QUEEN.**
==121==                But not by him.

**KING.**
==122==Let him demand his fill.

**LAER.**
==123==How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.
==124==To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!
==125==Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
==126==I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
==127==That both the worlds I give to negligence,
==128==Let come what comes, only I’ll be reveng’d
==129==Most throughly for my father.

**KING.**
==129==                Who shall stay you?

**LAER.**
==130==My will, not all the world’s:
==131==And for my means, I’ll husband them so well,
==132==They shall go far with little.

**KING.**
==132==              Good Laertes,
==133==If you desire to know the certainty
==134==Of your dear father, is’t writ in your revenge
==135==That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
==136==Winner and loser?

**LAER.**
==137==None but his enemies.

**KING.**
==137==           Will you know them then?

**LAER.**
==138==To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms,
==139==And like the kind life-rend’ring pelican,
==140==Repast them with my blood.

**KING.**
==140==              Why, now you speak
==141==Like a good child and a true gentleman.
==142==That I am guiltless of your father’s death,
==143==And am most sensibly in grief for it,
==144==It shall as level to your judgment ’pear
==145==As day does to your eye.
*(A noise within:)*
==146==“Let her come in!”

**LAER.**
==147==How now, what noise is that?
*(Enter Ophelia.)*
==148==O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
==149==Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
==150==By heaven, thy madness shall be paid with weight
==151==Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
==152==Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
==153==O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits
==154==Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?
==155==Nature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine,
==156==It sends some precious instance of itself
==157==After the thing it loves.

**OPH.**
*(Song.)*
==158==*“They bore him barefac’d on the bier,*
==159==*Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny,*
==160==*And in his grave rain’d many a tear”⁠—*
==161==Fare you well, my dove!

**LAER.**
==162==Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge,
==163==It could not move thus.

**OPH.**
==164==*You must sing, “A-down, a-down,”*
==165==*And you call him a-down-a.*
==166==O how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his master’s daughter.

**LAER.**
==167==This nothing’s more than matter.

**OPH.**
==168==There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray you, love, remember. And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.

**LAER.**
==169==A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.

**OPH.**
*(To Claudius.)*
==170==There’s fennel for you, and columbines.
*(To Gertrude.)*
==171==There’s rue for you, and here’s some for me; we may call it herb of grace a’ Sundays. You may wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they wither’d all when my father died. They say ’a made a good end⁠—
*(Sings.)*
==172==*“For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.”*

**LAER.**
==173==Thought and afflictions, passion, hell itself,
==174==She turns to favor and to prettiness.

**OPH.**
*(Song.)*
==175==*“And will ’a not come again?*
==176==*And will ’a not come again?*
==177==*No, no, he is dead,*
==178==*Go to thy death-bed,*
==179==*He never will come again.*
==180==*His beard was as white as snow,*
==181==*All flaxen was his pole,*
==182==*He is gone, he is gone,*
==183==*And we cast away moan,*
==184==*God ’a’ mercy on his soul!”*
==185==And of all Christians’ souls, I pray God. God buy you.

*Exit.*

**LAER.**
==186==Do you see this, O God?

**KING.**
==187==Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
==188==Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
==189==Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
==190==And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.
==191==If by direct or by collateral hand
==192==They find us touch’d, we will our kingdom give,
==193==Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
==194==To you in satisfaction; but if not,
==195==Be you content to lend your patience to us,
==196==And we shall jointly labor with your soul
==197==To give it due content.

**LAER.**
==197==           Let this be so.
==198==His means of death, his obscure funeral⁠—
==199==No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones,
==200==No noble rite nor formal ostentation⁠—
==201==Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth,
==202==That I must call’t in question.

**KING.**
==202==                So you shall,
==203==And where th’ offense is, let the great axe fall.
==204==I pray you go with me.

*Exeunt.*
