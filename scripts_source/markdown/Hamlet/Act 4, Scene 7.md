## Act 4, Scene 7
[[Act 4, Scene 6|← Act 4, Scene 6]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Elsinore. Another room in Elsinore castle.*

*Enter King and Laertes.*

**KING.**
==1==Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
==2==And you must put me in your heart for friend,
==3==Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
==4==That he which hath your noble father slain
==5==Pursued my life.

**LAER.**
==5==        It well appears. But tell me
==6==Why you proceeded not against these feats
==7==So criminal and so capital in nature,
==8==As by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else
==9==You mainly were stirr’d up.

**KING.**
==9==              O, for two special reasons,
==10==Which may to you perhaps seem much unsinew’d,
==11==But yet to me th’ are strong. The Queen his mother
==12==Lives almost by his looks, and for myself⁠—
==13==My virtue or my plague, be it either which⁠—
==14==She is so conjunctive to my life and soul,
==15==That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
==16==I could not but by her. The other motive,
==17==Why to a public count I might not go,
==18==Is the great love the general gender bear him,
==19==Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
==20==Work like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
==21==Convert his gyves to graces, so that my arrows,
==22==Too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,
==23==Would have reverted to my bow again,
==24==But not where I have aim’d them.

**LAER.**
==25==And so have I a noble father lost,
==26==A sister driven into desp’rate terms,
==27==Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
==28==Stood challenger on mount of all the age
==29==For her perfections—but my revenge will come.

**KING.**
==30==Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
==31==That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
==32==That we can let our beard be shook with danger
==33==And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
==34==I lov’d your father, and we love ourself,
==35==And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine⁠—
*(Enter a Messenger with letters.)*
==36==How now? What news?

**MESS.**
==36==           Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
==37==These to your Majesty, this to the queen.

**KING.**
==38==From Hamlet? Who brought them?

**MESS.**
==39==Sailors, my lord, they say, I saw them not.
==40==They were given me by Claudio. He receiv’d them
==41==Of him that brought them.

**KING.**
==41==              Laertes, you shall hear them.
==42==—Leave us.
*(Exit Messenger.)*
*(Reads.)*
==43==*“High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes, when I shall, first asking you pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return. Hamlet.”*
==44==What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
==45==Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

**LAER.**
==46==Know you the hand?

**KING.**
==46==           ’Tis Hamlet’s character. “Naked”!
==47==And in a postscript here he says “alone.”
==48==Can you devise me?

**LAER.**
==49==I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,
==50==It warms the very sickness in my heart
==51==That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
==52==“Thus didst thou.”

**KING.**
==52==           If it be so, Laertes⁠—
==53==As how should it be so? How otherwise?⁠—
==54==Will you be rul’d by me?

**LAER.**
==54==              Ay, my lord,
==55==So you will not o’errule me to a peace.

**KING.**
==56==To thine own peace. If he be now returned
==57==As checking at his voyage, and that he means
==58==No more to undertake it, I will work him
==59==To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
==60==Under the which he shall not choose but fall;
==61==And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
==62==But even his mother shall uncharge the practice,
==63==And call it accident.

**LAER.**
==63==              My lord, I will be rul’d,
==64==The rather if you could devise it so
==65==That I might be the organ.

**KING.**
==65==              It falls right.
==66==You have been talk’d of since your travel much,
==67==And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality
==68==Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts
==69==Did not together pluck such envy from him
==70==As did that one, and that, in my regard,
==71==Of the unworthiest siege.

**LAER.**
==71==              What part is that, my lord?

**KING.**
==72==A very riband in the cap of youth,
==73==Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes
==74==The light and careless livery that it wears
==75==Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
==76==Importing health and graveness. Two months since
==77==Here was a gentleman of Normandy:
==78==I have seen myself, and serv’d against, the French,
==79==And they can well on horseback, but this gallant
==80==Had witchcraft in’t, he grew unto his seat,
==81==And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
==82==As had he been incorps’d and demi-natur’d
==83==With the brave beast. So far he topp’d my thought,
==84==That I in forgery of shapes and tricks
==85==Come short of what he did.

**LAER.**
==85==              A Norman was’t?

**KING.**
==86==A Norman.

**LAER.**
==87==Upon my life, Lamord.

**KING.**
==87==              The very same.

**LAER.**
==88==I know him well. He is the brooch indeed
==89==And gem of all the nation.

**KING.**
==90==He made confession of you,
==91==And gave you such a masterly report
==92==For art and exercise in your defense,
==93==And for your rapier most especial,
==94==That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed
==95==If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
==96==He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
==97==If you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his
==98==Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
==99==That he could nothing do but wish and beg
==100==Your sudden coming o’er to play with you.
==101==Now, out of this⁠—

**LAER.**
==101==           What out of this, my lord?

**KING.**
==102==Laertes, was your father dear to you?
==103==Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
==104==A face without a heart?

**LAER.**
==104==              Why ask you this?

**KING.**
==105==Not that I think you did not love your father,
==106==But that I know love is begun by time,
==107==And that I see, in passages of proof,
==108==Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
==109==There lives within the very flame of love
==110==A kind of week or snuff that will abate it,
==111==And nothing is at a like goodness still,
==112==For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
==113==Dies in his own too much. That we would do,
==114==We should do when we would; for this “would” changes,
==115==And hath abatements and delays as many
==116==As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents,
==117==And then this ’should’ is like a spendthrift’s sigh,
==118==That hurts by easing. But to the quick of th’ ulcer:
==119==Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
==120==To show yourself indeed your father’s son
==121==More than in words?

**LAER.**
==121==           To cut his throat i’ th’ church.

**KING.**
==122==No place indeed should murder sanctuarize,
==123==Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
==124==Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
==125==Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home.
==126==We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence,
==127==And set a double varnish on the fame
==128==The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together,
==129==And wager o’er your heads. He, being remiss,
==130==Most generous, and free from all contriving,
==131==Will not peruse the foils, so that with ease,
==132==Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
==133==A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice
==134==Requite him for your father.

**LAER.**
==134==                I will do’t,
==135==And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.
==136==I bought an unction of a mountebank,
==137==So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
==138==Where it draws blood, no cataplasm so rare,
==139==Collected from all simples that have virtue
==140==Under the moon, can save the thing from death
==141==That is but scratch’d withal. I’ll touch my point
==142==With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
==143==It may be death.

**KING.**
==143==        Let’s further think of this,
==144==Weigh what convenience both of time and means
==145==May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,
==146==And that our drift look through our bad performance,
==147==’Twere better not assay’d; therefore this project
==148==Should have a back or second, that might hold
==149==If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.
==150==We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings⁠—
==151==I ha’t!
==152==When in your motion you are hot and dry⁠—
==153==As make your bouts more violent to that end⁠—
==154==And that he calls for drink, I’ll have preferr’d him
==155==A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
==156==If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,
==157==Our purpose may hold there. But stay, what noise?

*Enter Queen.*

**QUEEN.**
==158==One woe doth tread upon another’s heel,
==159==So fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.

**LAER.**
==160==Drown’d! O, where?

**QUEEN.**
==161==There is a willow grows askaunt the brook,
==162==That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream,
==163==Therewith fantastic garlands did she make
==164==Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
==165==That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
==166==But our cull-cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them.
==167==There on the pendant boughs her crownet weeds
==168==Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,
==169==When down her weedy trophies and herself
==170==Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,
==171==And mermaid-like awhile they bore her up,
==172==Which time she chaunted snatches of old lauds,
==173==As one incapable of her own distress,
==174==Or like a creature native and indued
==175==Unto that element. But long it could not be
==176==Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
==177==Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay
==178==To muddy death.

**LAER.**
==178==        Alas, then she is drown’d?

**QUEEN.**
==179==Drown’d, drown’d.

**LAER.**
==180==Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
==181==And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
==182==It is our trick, Nature her custom holds,
==183==Let shame say what it will; when these are gone,
==184==The woman will be out. *Adieu*, my lord,
==185==I have a speech a’ fire that fain would blaze,
==186==But that this folly drowns it.

*Exit.*

**KING.**
==186==                Let’s follow, Gertrude.
==187==How much I had to do to calm his rage!
==188==Now fear I this will give it start again,
==189==Therefore let’s follow.

*Exeunt.*
