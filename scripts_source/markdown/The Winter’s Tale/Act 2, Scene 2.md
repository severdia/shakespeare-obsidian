## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Sicilia. The outer room of a prison.*

*Enter Paulina, a Gentleman, and Attendants.*

**PAUL.**
==1==The keeper of the prison, call to him;
==2==Let him have knowledge who I am.
*(Exit Gentleman.)*
==2==                     Good lady,
==3==No court in Europe is too good for thee,
==4==What dost thou then in prison?
*(Enter Gentleman with the Jailer.)*
==4==                  Now, good sir,
==5==You know me, do you not?

**JAIL.**
==5==              For a worthy lady,
==6==And one who much I honor.

**PAUL.**
==6==                Pray you then,
==7==Conduct me to the Queen.

**JAIL.**
==7==              I may not, madam:
==8==To the contrary I have express commandment.

**PAUL.**
==9==Here’s ado, to lock up honesty
==10==And honor from th’ access of gentle visitors.
==11==Is’t lawful, pray you, to see her women?
==12==Any of them? Emilia?

**JAIL.**
==12==           So please you, madam,
==13==To put apart these your attendants, I
==14==Shall bring Emilia forth.

**PAUL.**
==14==              I pray now call her.⁠—
==15==Withdraw yourselves.

*Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants.*

**JAIL.**
==15==              And, madam, I must
==16==Be present at your conference.

**PAUL.**
==17==Well; be’t so; prithee.
*(Exit Jailer.)*
==18==Here’s such ado to make no stain a stain
==19==As passes coloring.
*(Enter Jailer with Emilia.)*
==19==           Dear gentlewoman,
==20==How fares our gracious lady?

**EMIL.**
==21==As well as one so great and so forlorn
==22==May hold together. On her frights and griefs
==23==(Which never tender lady hath borne greater) 
==24==She is, something before her time, deliver’d.

**PAUL.**
==25==A boy?

**EMIL.**
==25==    A daughter, and a goodly babe,
==26==Lusty and like to live. The Queen receives
==27==Much comfort in’t; says, “My poor prisoner,
==28==I am innocent as you.”

**PAUL.**
==28==              I dare be sworn.
==29==These dangerous, unsafe lunes i’ th’ King, beshrew them!
==30==He must be told on’t, and he shall. The office
==31==Becomes a woman best. I’ll take’t upon me.
==32==If I prove honey-mouth’d, let my tongue blister;
==33==And never to my red-look’d anger be
==34==The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
==35==Commend my best obedience to the Queen.
==36==If she dares trust me with her little babe,
==37==I’ll show’t the King, and undertake to be
==38==Her advocate to th’ loud’st. We do not know
==39==How he may soften at the sight o’ th’ child:
==40==The silence often of pure innocence
==41==Persuades when speaking fails.

**EMIL.**
==41==                  Most worthy madam,
==42==Your honor and your goodness is so evident
==43==That your free undertaking cannot miss
==44==A thriving issue. There is no lady living
==45==So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
==46==To visit the next room, I’ll presently
==47==Acquaint the Queen of your most noble offer,
==48==Who but today hammered of this design,
==49==But durst not tempt a minister of honor,
==50==Lest she should be denied.

**PAUL.**
==50==              Tell her, Emilia,
==51==I’ll use that tongue I have. If wit flow from’t
==52==As boldness from my bosom, let’t not be doubted
==53==I shall do good.

**EMIL.**
==53==        Now be you blest for it!
==54==I’ll to the Queen.—Please you, come something nearer.

**JAIL.**
==55==Madam, if’t please the Queen to send the babe,
==56==I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
==57==Having no warrant.

**PAUL.**
==57==           You need not fear it, sir.
==58==This child was prisoner to the womb, and is
==59==By law and process of great Nature thence
==60==Freed and enfranchis’d, not a party to
==61==The anger of the King, nor guilty of
==62==(If any be) the trespass of the Queen.

**JAIL.**
==63==I do believe it.

**PAUL.**
==64==Do not you fear. Upon mine honor, I
==65==Will stand betwixt you and danger.

*Exeunt.*
