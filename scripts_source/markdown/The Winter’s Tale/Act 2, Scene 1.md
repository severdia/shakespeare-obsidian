## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Sicilia. A room in Leontes’ palace.*

*Enter Hermione, Mamillius, Ladies.*

**HER.**
==1==Take the boy to you; he so troubles me,
==2==’Tis past enduring.

**1. LADY**
==2==           Come, my gracious lord,
==3==Shall I be your playfellow?

**MAM.**
==3==              No, I’ll none of you.

**1. LADY**
==4==Why, my sweet lord?

**MAM.**
==5==You’ll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
==6==I were a baby still.—I love you better.

**2. LADY**
==7==And why so, my lord?

**MAM.**
==7==              Not for because
==8==Your brows are blacker, yet black brows they say
==9==Become some women best, so that there be not
==10==Too much hair there, but in a semicircle,
==11==Or a half-moon made with a pen.

**2. LADY**
==11==                  Who taught’ this?

**MAM.**
==12==I learn’d it out of women’s faces. Pray now
==13==What color are your eyebrows?

**1. LADY**
==13==                  Blue, my lord.

**MAM.**
==14==Nay, that’s a mock. I have seen a lady’s nose
==15==That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

**1. LADY**
==15==                       Hark ye,
==16==The Queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
==17==Present our services to a fine new prince
==18==One of these days, and then you’ld wanton with us,
==19==If we would have you.

**2. LADY**
==19==              She is spread of late
==20==Into a goodly bulk. Good time encounter her!

**HER.**
==21==What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
==22==I am for you again. Pray you sit by us,
==23==And tell ’s a tale.

**MAM.**
==23==           Merry, or sad, shall’t be?

**HER.**
==24==As merry as you will.

**MAM.**
==25==A sad tale’s best for winter. I have one
==26==Of sprites and goblins.

**HER.**
==26==              Let’s have that, good sir.
==27==Come on, sit down, come on, and do your best
==28==To fright me with your sprites; you’re pow’rful at it.

**MAM.**
==29==There was a man⁠—

**HER.**
==29==           Nay, come sit down; then on.

**MAM.**
==30==Dwelt by a churchyard. I will tell it softly,
==31==Yond crickets shall not hear it.

**HER.**
==31==                Come on then,
==32==And give’t me in mine ear.

*Enter Leontes, Antigonus, Lords, and others.*

**LEON.**
==33==Was he met there? His train? Camillo with him?

**1. LORD.**
==34==Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
==35==Saw I men scour so on their way. I ey’d them
==36==Even to their ships.

**LEON.**
==36==           How blest am I
==37==In my just censure! In my true opinion!
==38==Alack, for lesser knowledge! How accurs’d
==39==In being so blest! There may be in the cup
==40==A spider steep’d, and one may drink; depart,
==41==And yet partake no venom (for his knowledge
==42==Is not infected), but if one present
==43==Th’ abhorr’d ingredient to his eye, make known
==44==How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
==45==With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.
==46==Camillo was his help in this, his pandar.
==47==There is a plot against my life, my crown;
==48==All’s true that is mistrusted. That false villain
==49==Whom I employ’d was pre-employ’d by him:
==50==He has discover’d my design, and I
==51==Remain a pinch’d thing; yea, a very trick
==52==For them to play at will. How came the posterns
==53==So easily open?

**1. LORD.**
==53==           By his great authority,
==54==Which often hath no less prevail’d than so
==55==On your command.

**LEON.**
==55==           I know’t too well.
==56==Give me the boy. I am glad you did not nurse him.
==57==Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
==58==Have too much blood in him.

**HER.**
==58==                What is this? Sport?

**LEON.**
==59==Bear the boy hence, he shall not come about her.
==60==Away with him! And let her sport herself
==61==With that she’s big with, for ’tis Polixenes
==62==Has made thee swell thus.

**HER.**
==62==              But I’d say he had not;
==63==And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,
==64==Howe’er you lean to th’ nayward.

**LEON.**
==64==                  You, my lords,
==65==Look on her, mark her well; be but about
==66==To say she is a goodly lady, and
==67==The justice of your hearts will thereto add
==68==’Tis pity she’s not honest—honorable.
==69==Praise her but for this her without-door form
==70==(Which on my faith deserves high speech) and straight
==71==The shrug, the hum or ha (these petty brands
==72==That calumny doth use—O, I am out⁠—
==73==That mercy does, for calumny will sear
==74==Virtue itself), these shrugs, these hums and ha’s,
==75==When you have said she’s goodly, come between
==76==Ere you can say she’s honest: but be’t known
==77==(From him that has most cause to grieve it should be) 
==78==She’s an adult’ress.

**HER.**
==78==           Should a villain say so,
==79==The most replenish’d villain in the world,
==80==He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
==81==Do but mistake.

**LEON.**
==81==        You have mistook, my lady,
==82==Polixenes for Leontes. O thou thing!
==83==Which I’ll not call a creature of thy place,
==84==Lest barbarism (making me the precedent) 
==85==Should a like language use to all degrees,
==86==And mannerly distinguishment leave out
==87==Betwixt the prince and beggar. I have said
==88==She’s an adult’ress, I have said with whom:
==89==More—she’s a traitor, and Camillo is
==90==A federary with her, and one that knows
==91==What she should shame to know herself,
==92==But with her most vild principal—that she’s
==93==A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
==94==That vulgars give bold’st titles; ay, and privy
==95==To this their late escape.

**HER.**
==95==              No, by my life,
==96==Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
==97==When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
==98==You thus have publish’d me! Gentle my lord,
==99==You scarce can right me throughly, then, to say
==100==You did mistake.

**LEON.**
==100==           No; if I mistake
==101==In those foundations which I build upon,
==102==The center is not big enough to bear
==103==A schoolboy’s top. Away with her, to prison!
==104==He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
==105==But that he speaks.

**HER.**
==105==           There’s some ill planet reigns;
==106==I must be patient, till the heavens look
==107==With an aspect more favorable. Good my lords,
==108==I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
==109==Commonly are, the want of which vain dew
==110==Perchance shall dry your pities; but I have
==111==That honorable grief lodg’d here which burns
==112==Worse than tears drown. Beseech you all, my lords,
==113==With thoughts so qualified as your charities
==114==Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
==115==The King’s will be perform’d!

**LEON.**
==115==                Shall I be heard?

**HER.**
==116==Who is’t that goes with me? Beseech your Highness
==117==My women may be with me, for you see
==118==My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools,
==119==There is no cause. When you shall know your mistress
==120==Has deserv’d prison, then abound in tears
==121==As I come out; this action I now go on
==122==Is for my better grace. *Adieu*, my lord,
==123==I never wish’d to see you sorry, now
==124==I trust I shall. My women, come, you have leave.

**LEON.**
==125==Go, do our bidding; hence!

*Exit Queen guarded, with Ladies.*

**1. LORD.**
==126==Beseech your Highness call the Queen again.

**ANT.**
==127==Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
==128==Prove violence, in the which three great ones suffer,
==129==Yourself, your queen, your son.

**1. LORD.**
==129==                  For her, my lord,
==130==I dare my life lay down—and will do’t, sir,
==131==Please you t’ accept it—that the Queen is spotless
==132==I’ th’eyes of heaven and to you—I mean,
==133==In this which you accuse her.

**ANT.**
==133==                If it prove
==134==She’s otherwise, I’ll keep my stables where
==135==I lodge my wife; I’ll go in couples with her;
==136==Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
==137==For every inch of woman in the world,
==138==Ay, every dram of woman’s flesh is false,
==139==If she be.

**LEON.**
==139==        Hold your peaces.

**1. LORD.**
==139==                  Good my lord⁠—

**ANT.**
==140==It is for you we speak, not for ourselves.
==141==You are abus’d, and by some putter-on
==142==That will be damn’d for’t. Would I knew the villain,
==143==I would land-damn him. Be she honor-flaw’d,
==144==I have three daughters: the eldest is eleven;
==145==The second and the third, nine, and some five;
==146==If this prove true, they’ll pay for’t. By mine honor,
==147==I’ll geld ’em all; fourteen they shall not see
==148==To bring false generations. They are co-heirs,
==149==And I had rather glib myself than they
==150==Should not produce fair issue.

**LEON.**
==150==                Cease, no more.
==151==You smell this business with a sense as cold
==152==As is a dead man’s nose; but I do see’t, and feel’t,
==153==As you feel doing thus
*(Grasps his arm.)*
==153==              —and see withal
==154==The instruments that feel.

**ANT.**
==154==              If it be so,
==155==We need no grave to bury honesty,
==156==There’s not a grain of it the face to sweeten
==157==Of the whole dungy earth.

**LEON.**
==157==              What? Lack I credit?

**1. LORD.**
==158==I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
==159==Upon this ground; and more it would content me
==160==To have her honor true than your suspicion,
==161==Be blam’d for’t how you might.

**LEON.**
==161==                  Why, what need we
==162==Commune with you of this, but rather follow
==163==Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
==164==Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
==165==Imparts this; which if you—or stupefied
==166==Or seeming so in skill—cannot, or will not,
==167==Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
==168==We need no more of your advice. The matter,
==169==The loss, the gain, the ord’ring on’t, is all
==170==Properly ours.

**ANT.**
==170==        And I wish, my liege,
==171==You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
==172==Without more overture.

**LEON.**
==172==              How could that be?
==173==Either thou art most ignorant by age,
==174==Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,
==175==Added to their familiarity
==176==(Which was as gross as ever touch’d conjecture,
==177==That lack’d sight only, nought for approbation
==178==But only seeing, all other circumstances
==179==Made up to th’ deed), doth push on this proceeding.
==180==Yet, for a greater confirmation
==181==(For in an act of this importance ’twere
==182==Most piteous to be wild), I have dispatch’d in post
==183==To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,
==184==Cleomines and Dion, whom you know
==185==Of stuff’d sufficiency. Now, from the oracle
==186==They will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,
==187==Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

**1. LORD.**
==188==Well done, my lord.

**LEON.**
==189==Though I am satisfied, and need no more
==190==Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
==191==Give rest to th’ minds of others—such as he,
*(Points at Antigonus.)*
==192==Whose ignorant credulity will not
==193==Come up to th’ truth. So have we thought it good
==194==From our free person she should be confin’d,
==195==Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
==196==Be left her to perform. Come follow us,
==197==We are to speak in public; for this business
==198==Will raise us all.

**ANT.**
*(Aside.)*
==198==           To laughter, as I take it,
==199==If the good truth were known.

*Exeunt.*
