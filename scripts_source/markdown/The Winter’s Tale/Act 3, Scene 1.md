## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Sicilia. A sea port.*

*Enter Cleomines and Dion.*

**CLEO.**
==1==The climate’s delicate, the air most sweet,
==2==Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
==3==The common praise it bears.

**DION.**
==3==                I shall report,
==4==For most it caught me, the celestial habits
==5==(Methinks I so should term them) and the reverence
==6==Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
==7==How ceremonious, solemn, and unearthly
==8==It was i’ th’ off’ring!

**CLEO.**
==8==           But of all, the burst
==9==And the ear-deaf’ning voice o’ th’ oracle,
==10==Kin to Jove’s thunder, so surpris’d my sense,
==11==That I was nothing.

**DION.**
==11==           If th’ event o’ th’ journey
==12==Prove as successful to the Queen (O be’t so!) 
==13==As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
==14==The time is worth the use on’t.

**CLEO.**
==14==                Great Apollo
==15==Turn all to th’ best! These proclamations,
==16==So forcing faults upon Hermione,
==17==I little like.

**DION.**
==17==        The violent carriage of it
==18==Will clear or end the business. When the oracle
==19==(Thus by Apollo’s great divine seal’d up) 
==20==Shall the contents discover, something rare
==21==Even then will rush to knowledge. Go; fresh horses!
==22==And gracious be the issue!

*Exeunt.*
