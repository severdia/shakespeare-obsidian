## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Sicilia. A room in the palace of Leontes.*

*Enter Leontes, Cleomines, Dion, Paulina, Servants.*

**CLEO.**
==1==Sir, you have done enough, and have perform’d
==2==A saint-like sorrow. No fault could you make
==3==Which you have not redeem’d; indeed paid down
==4==More penitence than done trespass. At the last
==5==Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil,
==6==With them, forgive yourself.

**LEON.**
==6==                Whilest I remember
==7==Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
==8==My blemishes in them, and so still think of
==9==The wrong I did myself; which was so much
==10==That heirless it hath made my kingdom, and
==11==Destroy’d the sweet’st companion that e’er man
==12==Bred his hopes out of.

**PAUL.**
==12==           True, too true, my lord.
==13==If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
==14==Or, from the all that are, took something good
==15==To make a perfect woman, she you kill’d
==16==Would be unparallel’d.

**LEON.**
==16==              I think so. Kill’d?
==17==She I kill’d? I did so; but thou strik’st me
==18==Sorely, to say I did. It is as bitter
==19==Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now,
==20==Say so but seldom.

**CLEO.**
==20==           Not at all, good lady.
==21==You might have spoken a thousand things that would
==22==Have done the time more benefit, and grac’d
==23==Your kindness better.

**PAUL.**
==23==           You are one of those
==24==Would have him wed again.

**DION.**
==24==              If you would not so,
==25==You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
==26==Of his most sovereign name; consider little
==27==What dangers, by his Highness’ fail of issue,
==28==May drop upon his kingdom, and devour
==29==Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy
==30==Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
==31==What holier than, for royalty’s repair,
==32==For present comfort, and for future good,
==33==To bless the bed of majesty again
==34==With a sweet fellow to’t?

**PAUL.**
==34==              There is none worthy,
==35==Respecting her that’s gone. Besides, the gods
==36==Will have fulfill’d their secret purposes;
==37==For has not the divine Apollo said,
==38==Is’t not the tenor of his oracle,
==39==That King Leontes shall not have an heir
==40==Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall,
==41==Is all as monstrous to our human reason
==42==As my Antigonus to break his grave,
==43==And come again to me; who, on my life,
==44==Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel
==45==My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
==46==Oppose against their wills.
*(To Leontes.)*
==46==              Care not for issue,
==47==The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander
==48==Left his to th’ worthiest; so his successor
==49==Was like to be the best.

**LEON.**
==49==              Good Paulina,
==50==Who hast the memory of Hermione,
==51==I know, in honor, O, that ever I
==52==Had squar’d me to thy counsel! Then, even now,
==53==I might have look’d upon my queen’s full eyes,
==54==Have taken treasure from her lips⁠—

**PAUL.**
==54==                  And left them
==55==More rich for what they yielded.

**LEON.**
==55==                  Thou speak’st truth:
==56==No more such wives, therefore no wife. One worse,
==57==And better us’d, would make her sainted spirit
==58==Again possess her corpse, and on this stage
==59==(Where we offenders now) appear soul-vex’d,
==60==And begin, “Why to me—?”

**PAUL.**
==60==                Had she such power,
==61==She had just cause.

**LEON.**
==61==           She had, and would incense me
==62==To murder her I married.

**PAUL.**
==62==              I should so:
==63==Were I the ghost that walk’d, I’ld bid you mark
==64==Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in’t
==65==You chose her; then I’ld shriek, that even your ears
==66==Should rift to hear me, and the words that follow’d
==67==Should be “Remember mine.”

**LEON.**
==67==                  Stars, stars,
==68==And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
==69==I’ll have no wife, Paulina.

**PAUL.**
==69==              Will you swear
==70==Never to marry but by my free leave?

**LEON.**
==71==Never, Paulina, so be bless’d my spirit!

**PAUL.**
==72==Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

**CLEO.**
==73==You tempt him overmuch.

**PAUL.**
==73==              Unless another,
==74==As like Hermione as is her picture,
==75==Affront his eye.

**CLEO.**
==75==        Good madam⁠—

**PAUL.**
==75==                I have done.
==76==Yet if my lord will marry—if you will, sir,
==77==No remedy but you will—give me the office
==78==To choose you a queen. She shall not be so young
==79==As was your former, but she shall be such
==80==As (walk’d your first queen’s ghost) it should take joy
==81==To see her in your arms.

**LEON.**
==81==              My true Paulina,
==82==We shall not marry till thou bid’st us.

**PAUL.**
==82==                       That
==83==Shall be when your first queen’s again in breath;
==84==Never till then.

*Enter First Servant.*

**1. SERV.**
==85==One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
==86==Son of Polixenes, with his princess (she
==87==The fairest I have yet beheld), desires access
==88==To your high presence.

**LEON.**
==88==           What with him? He comes not
==89==Like to his father’s greatness. His approach,
==90==So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
==91==’Tis not a visitation fram’d, but forc’d
==92==By need and accident. What train?

**1. SERV.**
==92==                     But few,
==93==And those but mean.

**LEON.**
==93==           His princess, say you, with him?

**1. SERV.**
==94==Ay; the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
==95==That e’er the sun shone bright on.

**PAUL.**
==95==                  O Hermione,
==96==As every present time doth boast itself
==97==Above a better gone, so must thy grave
==98==Give way to what’s seen now! Sir, you yourself
==99==Have said and writ so, but your writing now
==100==Is colder than that theme, “She had not been,
==101==Nor was not to be equall’d”—thus your verse
==102==Flow’d with her beauty once. ’Tis shrewdly ebb’d,
==103==To say you have seen a better.

**1. SERV.**
==103==                Pardon, madam:
==104==The one I have almost forgot—your pardon⁠—
==105==The other, when she has obtain’d your eye,
==106==Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
==107==Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
==108==Of all professors else, make proselytes
==109==Of who she but bid follow.

**PAUL.**
==109==              How? Not women?

**1. SERV.**
==110==Women will love her, that she is a woman
==111==More worth than any man; men, that she is
==112==The rarest of all women.

**LEON.**
==112==              Go, Cleomines;
==113==Yourself, assisted with your honor’d friends,
==114==Bring them to our embracement.
*(Exeunt Cleomines and others.)*
==114==              Still, ’tis strange
==115==He thus should steal upon us.

**PAUL.**
==115==                Had our prince,
==116==Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair’d
==117==Well with this lord; there was not full a month
==118==Between their births.

**LEON.**
==119==Prithee no more; cease. Thou know’st
==120==He dies to me again when talk’d of. Sure
==121==When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
==122==Will bring me to consider that which may
==123==Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
*(Enter Florizel, Perdita, Cleomines, and others.)*
==124==Your mother was most true to wedlock, Prince,
==125==For she did print your royal father off,
==126==Conceiving you. Were I but twenty-one,
==127==Your father’s image is so hit in you
==128==(His very air) that I should call you brother,
==129==As I did him, and speak of something wildly
==130==By us perform’d before. Most dearly welcome!
==131==And your fair princess—goddess! O! Alas,
==132==I lost a couple, that ’twixt heaven and earth
==133==Might thus have stood, begetting wonder, as
==134==You, gracious couple, do; and then I lost
==135==(All mine own folly) the society,
==136==Amity too, of your brave father, whom
==137==(Though bearing misery) I desire my life
==138==Once more to look on him.

**FLO.**
==138==              By his command
==139==Have I here touch’d Sicilia, and from him
==140==Give you all greetings that a king (at friend) 
==141==Can send his brother; and but infirmity
==142==(Which waits upon worn times) hath something seiz’d
==143==His wish’d ability, he had himself
==144==The lands and waters ’twixt your throne and his
==145==Measur’d to look upon you; whom he loves
==146==(He bade me say so) more than all the scepters,
==147==And those that bear them, living.

**LEON.**
==147==                  O my brother,
==148==Good gentleman! The wrongs I have done thee stir
==149==Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
==150==So rarely kind, are as interpreters
==151==Of my behind-hand slackness.—Welcome hither,
==152==As is the spring to th’ earth. And hath he too
==153==Expos’d this paragon to th’ fearful usage
==154==(At least ungentle) of the dreadful Neptune,
==155==To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
==156==Th’ adventure of her person?

**FLO.**
==156==                Good my lord,
==157==She came from Libya.

**LEON.**
==157==              Where the warlike Smalus,
==158==That noble honor’d lord, is fear’d and lov’d?

**FLO.**
==159==Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
==160==His tears proclaim’d his, parting with her; thence
==161==(A prosperous south-wind friendly) we have cross’d,
==162==To execute the charge my father gave me
==163==For visiting your Highness. My best train
==164==I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss’d;
==165==Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
==166==Not only my success in Libya, sir,
==167==But my arrival, and my wife’s, in safety
==168==Here, where we are.

**LEON.**
==168==           The blessed gods
==169==Purge all infection from our air whilest you
==170==Do climate here! You have a holy father,
==171==A graceful gentleman, against whose person
==172==(So sacred as it is) I have done sin,
==173==For which the heavens, taking angry note,
==174==Have left me issueless; and your father’s bless’d
==175==(As he from heaven merits it) with you,
==176==Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
==177==Might I a son and daughter now have look’d on,
==178==Such goodly things as you?

*Enter a Lord.*

**1. LORD.**
==178==                Most noble sir,
==179==That which I shall report will bear no credit,
==180==Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
==181==Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
==182==Desires you to attach his son, who has
==183==(His dignity and duty both cast off) 
==184==Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
==185==A shepherd’s daughter.

**LEON.**
==185==              Where’s Bohemia? Speak.

**1. LORD.**
==186==Here, in your city; I now came from him.
==187==I speak amazedly, and it becomes
==188==My marvel and my message. To your court
==189==Whiles he was hast’ning (in the chase, it seems,
==190==Of this fair couple), meets he on the way
==191==The father of this seeming lady, and
==192==Her brother, having both their country quitted
==193==With this young prince.

**FLO.**
==193==              Camillo has betray’d me;
==194==Whose honor and whose honesty till now
==195==Endur’d all weathers.

**1. LORD.**
==195==           Lay’t so to his charge:
==196==He’s with the King your father.

**LEON.**
==196==                  Who? Camillo?

**1. LORD.**
==197==Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
==198==Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
==199==Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
==200==Forswear themselves as often as they speak.
==201==Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
==202==With diverse deaths in death.

**PER.**
==202==              O my poor father!
==203==The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
==204==Our contract celebrated.

**LEON.**
==204==              You are married?

**FLO.**
==205==We are not, sir, nor are we like to be.
==206==The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first;
==207==The odds for high and low’s alike.

**LEON.**
==207==                  My lord,
==208==Is this the daughter of a king?

**FLO.**
==208==                She is,
==209==When once she is my wife.

**LEON.**
==210==That “once,” I see, by your good father’s speed,
==211==Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
==212==Most sorry, you have broken from his liking,
==213==Where you were tied in duty; and as sorry
==214==Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
==215==That you might well enjoy her.

**FLO.**
==215==                  Dear, look up.
==216==Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
==217==Should chase us with my father, pow’r no jot
==218==Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
==219==Remember since you ow’d no more to time
==220==Than I do now. With thought of such affections,
==221==Step forth mine advocate. At your request
==222==My father will grant precious things as trifles.

**LEON.**
==223==Would he do so, I’ld beg your precious mistress,
==224==Which he counts but a trifle.

**PAUL.**
==224==                Sir, my liege,
==225==Your eye hath too much youth in’t. Not a month
==226==’Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
==227==Than what you look on now.

**LEON.**
==227==                I thought of her,
==228==Even in these looks I made.
*(To Florizel.)*
==228==                But your petition
==229==Is yet unanswer’d. I will to your father.
==230==Your honor not o’erthrown by your desires,
==231==I am friend to them and you. Upon which errand
==232==I now go toward him; therefore follow me,
==233==And mark what way I make. Come, good my lord.

*Exeunt.*
