## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]]

*A chapel in Paulina’s house.*

*Enter Leontes, Polixenes, Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords, etc.*

**LEON.**
==1==O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
==2==That I have had of thee!

**PAUL.**
==2==              What, sovereign sir,
==3==I did not well, I meant well. All my services
==4==You have paid home; but that you have vouchsaf’d,
==5==With your crown’d brother and these your contracted
==6==Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
==7==It is a surplus of your grace, which never
==8==My life may last to answer.

**LEON.**
==8==                O Paulina,
==9==We honor you with trouble; but we came
==10==To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery
==11==Have we pass’d through, not without much content
==12==In many singularities; but we saw not
==13==That which my daughter came to look upon,
==14==The statue of her mother.

**PAUL.**
==14==              As she liv’d peerless,
==15==So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
==16==Excels what ever yet you look’d upon,
==17==Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
==18==Lonely, apart. But here it is; prepare
==19==To see the life as lively mock’d as ever
==20==Still sleep mock’d death. Behold, and say ’tis well.
*(Paulina draws a curtain, and discovers Hermione standing like a statue.)*
==21==I like your silence, it the more shows off
==22==Your wonder; but yet speak. First, you, my liege;
==23==Comes it not something near?

**LEON.**
==23==                Her natural posture!
==24==Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
==25==Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
==26==In thy not chiding; for she was as tender
==27==As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
==28==Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
==29==So aged as this seems.

**POL.**
==29==              O, not by much.

**PAUL.**
==30==So much the more our carver’s excellence,
==31==Which lets go by some sixteen years, and makes her
==32==As she liv’d now.

**LEON.**
==32==           As now she might have done,
==33==So much to my good comfort as it is
==34==Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
==35==Even with such life of majesty (warm life,
==36==As now it coldly stands), when first I woo’d her!
==37==I am asham’d; does not the stone rebuke me
==38==For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
==39==There’s magic in thy majesty, which has
==40==My evils conjur’d to remembrance, and
==41==From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
==42==Standing like stone with thee.

**PER.**
==42==                And give me leave,
==43==And do not say ’tis superstition, that
==44==I kneel, and then implore her blessing. Lady,
==45==Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
==46==Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

**PAUL.**
==46==                  O, patience!
==47==The statue is but newly fix’d; the color’s
==48==Not dry.

**CAM.**
==49==My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
==50==Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
==51==So many summers dry. Scarce any joy
==52==Did ever so long live; no sorrow
==53==But kill’d itself much sooner.

**POL.**
==53==                Dear my brother,
==54==Let him that was the cause of this have pow’r
==55==To take off so much grief from you as he
==56==Will piece up in himself.

**PAUL.**
==56==              Indeed, my lord,
==57==If I had thought the sight of my poor image
==58==Would thus have wrought you (for the stone is mine),
==59==I’ld not have show’d it.

**LEON.**
==59==              Do not draw the curtain.

**PAUL.**
==60==No longer shall you gaze on’t, lest your fancy
==61==May think anon it moves.

**LEON.**
==61==              Let be, let be.
==62==Would I were dead but that methinks already⁠—
==63==What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
==64==Would you not deem it breath’d? And that those veins
==65==Did verily bear blood?

**POL.**
==65==              Masterly done!
==66==The very life seems warm upon her lip.

**LEON.**
==67==The fixure of her eye has motion in’t,
==68==As we are mock’d with art.

**PAUL.**
==68==              I’ll draw the curtain.
==69==My lord’s almost so far transported that
==70==He’ll think anon it lives.

**LEON.**
==70==              O sweet Paulina,
==71==Make me to think so twenty years together!
==72==No settled senses of the world can match
==73==The pleasure of that madness. Let’t alone.

**PAUL.**
==74==I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you; but
==75==I could afflict you farther.

**LEON.**
==75==              Do, Paulina;
==76==For this affliction has a taste as sweet
==77==As any cordial comfort. Still methinks
==78==There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel
==79==Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
==80==For I will kiss her.

**PAUL.**
==80==           Good my lord, forbear.
==81==The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
==82==You’ll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own
==83==With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

**LEON.**
==84==No! Not these twenty years.

**PER.**
==84==              So long could I
==85==Stand by, a looker-on.

**PAUL.**
==85==              Either forbear,
==86==Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
==87==For more amazement. If you can behold it,
==88==I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend,
==89==And take you by the hand; but then you’ll think
==90==(Which I protest against) I am assisted
==91==By wicked powers.

**LEON.**
==91==           What you can make her do,
==92==I am content to look on; what to speak,
==93==I am content to hear; for ’tis as easy
==94==To make her speak as move.

**PAUL.**
==94==              It is requir’d
==95==You do awake your faith. Then, all stand still.
==96==On; those that think it is unlawful business
==97==I am about, let them depart.

**LEON.**
==97==                  Proceed;
==98==No foot shall stir.

**PAUL.**
==98==           Music! Awake her! Strike!
*(Music.)*
==99==’Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
==100==Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come;
==101==I’ll fill your grave up. Stir; nay, come away;
==102==Bequeath to death your numbness; for from him
==103==Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs.
*(Hermione comes down.)*
==104==Start not; her actions shall be holy, as
==105==You hear my spell is lawful. Do not shun her
==106==Until you see her die again, for then
==107==You kill her double. Nay, present your hand.
==108==When she was young, you woo’d her; now, in age,
==109==Is she become the suitor?

**LEON.**
==109==              O, she’s warm!
==110==If this be magic, let it be an art
==111==Lawful as eating.

**POL.**
==111==           She embraces him.

**CAM.**
==112==She hangs about his neck.
==113==If she pertain to life let her speak too.

**POL.**
==114==Ay, and make it manifest where she has liv’d,
==115==Or how stol’n from the dead.

**PAUL.**
==115==                That she is living,
==116==Were it but told you, should be hooted at
==117==Like an old tale; but it appears she lives,
==118==Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
==119==Please you to interpose, fair madam, kneel,
==120==And pray your mother’s blessing. Turn, good lady,
==121==Our Perdita is found.

**HER.**
==121==           You gods, look down
==122==And from your sacred vials pour your graces
==123==Upon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own,
==124==Where hast thou been preserv’d? Where liv’d? How found
==125==Thy father’s court? For thou shalt hear that I,
==126==Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
==127==Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserv’d
==128==Myself to see the issue.

**PAUL.**
==128==              There’s time enough for that;
==129==Least they desire (upon this push) to trouble
==130==Your joys with like relation. Go together,
==131==You precious winners all; your exultation
==132==Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
==133==Will wing me to some wither’d bough, and there
==134==My mate (that’s never to be found again) 
==135==Lament till I am lost.

**LEON.**
==135==           O, peace, Paulina!
==136==Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
==137==As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
==138==And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found mine,
==139==But how, is to be question’d; for I saw her
==140==(As I thought) dead; and have (in vain) said many
==141==A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far
==142==(For him, I partly know his mind) to find thee
==143==An honorable husband. Come, Camillo,
==144==And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
==145==Is richly noted; and here justified
==146==By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.
==147==What? Look upon my brother. Both your pardons,
==148==That e’er I put between your holy looks
==149==My ill suspicion. This’ your son-in-law,
==150==And son unto the King, whom heavens directing
==151==Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
==152==Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
==153==Each one demand, and answer to his part
==154==Perform’d in this wide gap of time, since first
==155==We were dissever’d. Hastily lead away.

*Exeunt.*
