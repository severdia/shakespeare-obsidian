## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Sicilia. A court of justice.*

*Enter Leontes, Lords, Officers.*

**LEON.**
==1==This sessions (to our great grief we pronounce) 
==2==Even pushes ’gainst our heart—the party tried,
==3==The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
==4==Of us too much belov’d. Let us be clear’d
==5==Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
==6==Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
==7==Even to the guilt or the purgation.
==8==Produce the prisoner.

**OFF.**
==9==It is his Highness’ pleasure that the Queen
==10==Appear in person here in court.
*(Enter Hermione (as to her trial), Paulina, and Ladies attending.)*
==10==                  Silence!

**LEON.**
==11==Read the indictment.

**OFF.**
*(Reads.)*
==12==*“Hermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, King of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes, King of Bohemia, and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King, thy royal husband: the pretense whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by night.”*

**HER.**
==13==Since what I am to say must be but that
==14==Which contradicts my accusation, and
==15==The testimony on my part no other
==16==But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
==17==To say “Not guilty.” Mine integrity,
==18==Being counted falsehood, shall (as I express it) 
==19==Be so receiv’d. But thus, if pow’rs divine
==20==Behold our human actions (as they do),
==21==I doubt not then but innocence shall make
==22==False accusation blush, and tyranny
==23==Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know
==24==(Who least will seem to do so) my past life
==25==Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
==26==As I am now unhappy; which is more
==27==Than history can pattern, though devis’d
==28==And play’d to take spectators. For behold me,
==29==A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
==30==A moi’ty of the throne, a great king’s daughter,
==31==The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
==32==To prate and talk for life and honor ’fore
==33==Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
==34==As I weigh grief, which I would spare; for honor,
==35==’Tis a derivative from me to mine,
==36==And only that I stand for. I appeal
==37==To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
==38==Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
==39==How merited to be so; since he came,
==40==With what encounter so uncurrent I
==41==Have strain’d t’ appear thus; if one jot beyond
==42==The bound of honor, or in act or will
==43==That way inclining, hard’ned be the hearts
==44==Of all that hear me, and my near’st of kin
==45==Cry fie upon my grave!

**LEON.**
==45==              I ne’er heard yet
==46==That any of these bolder vices wanted
==47==Less impudence to gainsay what they did
==48==Than to perform it first.

**HER.**
==48==              That’s true enough,
==49==Though ’tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

**LEON.**
==50==You will not own it.

**HER.**
==50==           More than mistress of
==51==Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
==52==At all acknowledge. For Polixenes
==53==(With whom I am accus’d), I do confess
==54==I lov’d him as in honor he requir’d;
==55==With such a kind of love as might become
==56==A lady like me; with a love even such,
==57==So, and no other, as yourself commanded;
==58==Which not to have done I think had been in me
==59==Both disobedience and ingratitude
==60==To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
==61==Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely,
==62==That it was yours. Now for conspiracy,
==63==I know not how it tastes, though it be dish’d
==64==For me to try how. All I know of it
==65==Is that Camillo was an honest man;
==66==And why he left your court, the gods themselves
==67==(Wotting no more than I) are ignorant.

**LEON.**
==68==You knew of his departure, as you know
==69==What you have underta’en to do in ’s absence.

**HER.**
==70==Sir,
==71==You speak a language that I understand not.
==72==My life stands in the level of your dreams,
==73==Which I’ll lay down.

**LEON.**
==73==           Your actions are my dreams.
==74==You had a bastard by Polixenes,
==75==And I but dream’d it. As you were past all shame
==76==(Those of your fact are so), so past all truth;
==77==Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
==78==Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
==79==No father owning it (which is indeed
==80==More criminal in thee than it), so thou
==81==Shall feel our justice; in whose easiest passage
==82==Look for no less than death.

**HER.**
==82==              Sir, spare your threats.
==83==The bug which you would fright me with, I seek.
==84==To me can life be no commodity;
==85==The crown and comfort of my life, your favor,
==86==I do give lost, for I do feel it gone,
==87==But know not how it went. My second joy
==88==And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
==89==I am barr’d, like one infectious. My third comfort
==90==(Starr’d most unluckily) is from my breast
==91==(The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth) 
==92==Hal’d out to murder; myself on every post
==93==Proclaim’d a strumpet; with immodest hatred
==94==The child-bed privilege denied, which ’longs
==95==To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
==96==Here to this place, i’ th’ open air, before
==97==I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
==98==Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
==99==That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
==100==But yet hear this—mistake me not; no life
==101==(I prize it not a straw), but for mine honor,
==102==Which I would free—if I shall be condemn’d
==103==Upon surmises (all proofs sleeping else
==104==But what your jealousies awake), I tell you
==105==’Tis rigor and not law. Your honors all,
==106==I do refer me to the oracle:
==107==Apollo be my judge!

**1. LORD.**
==107==           This your request
==108==Is altogether just; therefore bring forth,
==109==And in Apollo’s name, his oracle.

*Exeunt certain Officers.*

**HER.**
==110==The Emperor of Russia was my father.
==111==O that he were alive, and here beholding
==112==His daughter’s trial! That he did but see
==113==The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
==114==Of pity, not revenge!

*Enter Officers with Cleomines, Dion.*

**OFF.**
==115==You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
==116==That you, Cleomines and Dion, have
==117==Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
==118==This seal’d-up oracle, by the hand deliver’d
==119==Of great Apollo’s priest; and that since then
==120==You have not dar’d to break the holy seal
==121==Nor read the secrets in’t.

**BOTH CLEO. AND DION.**
==121==              All this we swear.

**LEON.**
==122==Break up the seals, and read.

**OFF.**
*(Reads.)*
==123==*“Hermione is chaste, Polixenes blameless, Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant, his innocent babe truly begotten, and the King shall live without an heir, if that which is lost be not found.”*

**LORDS.**
==124==Now blessed be the great Apollo!

**HER.**
==124==                  Praised!

**LEON.**
==125==Hast thou read truth?

**OFF.**
==125==           Ay, my lord, even so
==126==As it is here set down.

**LEON.**
==127==There is no truth at all i’ th’ oracle.
==128==The sessions shall proceed; this is mere falsehood.

*Enter First Servant.*

**1. SERV.**
==129==My lord the King! The King!

**LEON.**
==129==              What is the business?

**1. SERV.**
==130==O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
==131==The Prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
==132==Of the Queen’s speed, is gone.

**LEON.**
==132==                How? Gone?

**1. SERV.**
==132==                         Is dead.

**LEON.**
==133==Apollo’s angry, and the heavens themselves
==134==Do strike at my injustice.
*(Hermione swoons.)*
==134==              How now there?

**PAUL.**
==135==This news is mortal to the Queen. Look down
==136==And see what death is doing.

**LEON.**
==136==                Take her hence;
==137==Her heart is but o’ercharg’d; she will recover.
==138==I have too much believ’d mine own suspicion.
==139==Beseech you tenderly apply to her
==140==Some remedies for life.
*(Exeunt Paulina and Ladies with Hermione.)*
==140==              Apollo, pardon
==141==My great profaneness ’gainst thine oracle!
==142==I’ll reconcile me to Polixenes,
==143==New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
==144==Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
==145==For being transported by my jealousies
==146==To bloody thoughts, and to revenge, I chose
==147==Camillo for the minister to poison
==148==My friend Polixenes; which had been done,
==149==But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
==150==My swift command, though I with death and with
==151==Reward did threaten and encourage him,
==152==Not doing it and being done. He (most humane
==153==And fill’d with honor) to my kingly guest
==154==Unclasp’d my practice, quit his fortunes here
==155==(Which you knew great), and to the hazard of
==156==All incertainties himself commended,
==157==No richer than his honor. How he glisters
==158==Through my rust! And how his piety
==159==Does my deeds make the blacker!

*Enter Paulina.*

**PAUL.**
==159==                  Woe the while!
==160==O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
==161==Break too!

**1. LORD.**
==161==        What fit is this, good lady?

**PAUL.**
==162==What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
==163==What wheels? Racks? Fires? What flaying? Boiling
==164==In leads or oils? What old or newer torture
==165==Must I receive, whose every word deserves
==166==To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny,
==167==Together working with thy jealousies
==168==(Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
==169==For girls of nine), O, think what they have done,
==170==And then run mad indeed—stark mad! For all
==171==Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
==172==That thou betrayedst Polixenes, ’twas nothing⁠—
==173==That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant,
==174==And damnable ingrateful; nor was’t much
==175==Thou wouldst have poison’d good Camillo’s honor,
==176==To have him kill a king—poor trespasses,
==177==More monstrous standing by; whereof I reckon
==178==The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
==179==To be or none or little—though a devil
==180==Would have shed water out of fire ere done’t;
==181==Nor is’t directly laid to thee, the death
==182==Of the young Prince, whose honorable thoughts
==183==(Thoughts high for one so tender) cleft the heart
==184==That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
==185==Blemish’d his gracious dam; this is not, no,
==186==Laid to thy answer: but the last—O lords,
==187==When I have said, cry “Woe!”—the Queen, the Queen,
==188==The sweet’st, dear’st creature’s dead, and vengeance for’t
==189==Not dropp’d down yet.

**1. LORD.**
==189==              The higher pow’rs forbid!

**PAUL.**
==190==I say she’s dead; I’ll swear’t. If word nor oath
==191==Prevail not, go and see. If you can bring
==192==Tincture or luster in her lip, her eye,
==193==Heat outwardly or breath within, I’ll serve you
==194==As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
==195==Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
==196==Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
==197==To nothing but despair. A thousand knees,
==198==Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
==199==Upon a barren mountain, and still winter
==200==In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
==201==To look that way thou wert.

**LEON.**
==201==              Go on, go on;
==202==Thou canst not speak too much, I have deserv’d
==203==All tongues to talk their bitt’rest.

**1. LORD.**
==203==                  Say no more.
==204==Howe’er the business goes, you have made fault
==205==I’ th’ boldness of your speech.

**PAUL.**
==205==                I am sorry for’t.
==206==All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
==207==I do repent. Alas, I have show’d too much
==208==The rashness of a woman; he is touch’d
==209==To th’ noble heart. What’s gone and what’s past help
==210==Should be past grief. Do not receive affliction
==211==At my petition; I beseech you, rather
==212==Let me be punish’d, that have minded you
==213==Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege,
==214==Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman.
==215==The love I bore your queen—lo, fool again!⁠—
==216==I’ll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
==217==I’ll not remember you of my own lord,
==218==Who is lost too. Take your patience to you,
==219==And I’ll say nothing.

**LEON.**
==219==           Thou didst speak but well
==220==When most the truth; which I receive much better
==221==Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee bring me
==222==To the dead bodies of my queen and son.
==223==One grave shall be for both; upon them shall
==224==The causes of their death appear (unto
==225==Our shame perpetual). Once a day I’ll visit
==226==The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
==227==Shall be my recreation. So long as nature
==228==Will bear up with this exercise, so long
==229==I daily vow to use it. Come, and lead me
==230==To these sorrows.

*Exeunt.*
