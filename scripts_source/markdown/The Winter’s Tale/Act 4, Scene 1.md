## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Enter Time, the Chorus.*

**TIME.**
==1== I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
==2== Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
==3== Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
==4== To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
==5== To me, or my swift passage, that I slide
==6== O’er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
==7== Of that wide gap, since it is in my pow’r
==8== To o’erthrow law, and in one self-born hour
==9== To plant and o’erwhelm custom. Let me pass
==10== The same I am, ere ancient’st order was,
==11== Or what is now receiv’d. I witness to
==12== The times that brought them in; so shall I do
==13== To th’ freshest things now reigning, and make stale
==14== The glistering of this present, as my tale
==15== Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
==16== I turn my glass, and give my scene such growing
==17== As you had slept between. Leontes leaving⁠—
==18== Th’ effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
==19== That he shuts up himself—imagine me,
==20== Gentle spectators, that I now may be
==21== In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
==22== I mentioned a son o’ th’ King’s, which Florizel
==23== I now name to you; and with speed so pace
==24== To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
==25== Equal with wond’ring. What of her ensues
==26== I list not prophesy; but let Time’s news
==27== Be known when ’tis brought forth. A shepherd’s daughter,
==28== And what to her adheres, which follows after,
==29== Is th’ argument of Time. Of this allow,
==30== If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
==31== If never, yet that Time himself doth say,
==32== He wishes earnestly you never may.

*Exit.*
