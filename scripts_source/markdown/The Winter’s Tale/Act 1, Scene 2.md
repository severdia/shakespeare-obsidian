## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Sicilia. A room of state in Leontes’ palace.*

*Enter Leontes, Hermione, Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo, and Attendants.*

**POL.**
==1==Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been
==2==The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne
==3==Without a burden. Time as long again
==4==Would be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks,
==5==And yet we should, for perpetuity,
==6==Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher
==7==(Yet standing in rich place), I multiply
==8==With one “We thank you” many thousands more
==9==That go before it.

**LEON.**
==9==           Stay your thanks a while,
==10==And pay them when you part.

**POL.**
==10==                Sir, that’s tomorrow.
==11==I am question’d by my fears of what may chance
==12==Or breed upon our absence, that may blow
==13==No sneaping winds at home, to make us say,
==14==“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d
==15==To tire your royalty.

**LEON.**
==15==           We are tougher, brother,
==16==Than you can put us to’t.

**POL.**
==16==              No longer stay.

**LEON.**
==17==One sev’nnight longer.

**POL.**
==17==              Very sooth, tomorrow.

**LEON.**
==18==We’ll part the time between ’s then; and in that
==19==I’ll no gainsaying.

**POL.**
==19==           Press me not, beseech you, so.
==20==There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world,
==21==So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,
==22==Were there necessity in your request, although
==23==’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
==24==Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder
==25==Were (in your love) a whip to me; my stay,
==26==To you a charge and trouble. To save both,
==27==Farewell, our brother.

**LEON.**
==27==           Tongue-tied our queen? Speak you.

**HER.**
==28==I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
==29==You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
==30==Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure
==31==All in Bohemia’s well; this satisfaction
==32==The by-gone day proclaim’d. Say this to him,
==33==He’s beat from his best ward.

**LEON.**
==33==                Well said, Hermione.

**HER.**
==34==To tell he longs to see his son were strong;
==35==But let him say so then, and let him go;
==36==But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
==37==We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.
==38==Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure
==39==The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
==40==You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission
==41==To let him there a month behind the gest
==42==Prefix’d for ’s parting; yet, good deed, Leontes,
==43==I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind
==44==What lady she her lord. You’ll stay?

**POL.**
==44==                  No, madam.

**HER.**
==45==Nay, but you will?

**POL.**
==45==           I may not, verily.

**HER.**
==46==Verily?
==47==You put me off with limber vows; but I,
==48==Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths,
==49==Should yet say, “Sir, no going.” Verily,
==50==You shall not go; a lady’s “verily” is
==51==As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?
==52==Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
==53==Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees
==54==When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
==55==My prisoner? Or my guest? By your dread “verily,”
==56==One of them you shall be.

**POL.**
==56==              Your guest then, madam.
==57==To be your prisoner should import offending,
==58==Which is for me less easy to commit
==59==Than you to punish.

**HER.**
==59==           Not your jailer then,
==60==But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you
==61==Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.
==62==You were pretty lordings then?

**POL.**
==62==                We were, fair queen,
==63==Two lads that thought there was no more behind
==64==But such a day tomorrow as today,
==65==And to be boy eternal.

**HER.**
==65==              Was not my lord
==66==The verier wag o’ th’ two?

**POL.**
==67==We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun,
==68==And bleat the one at th’ other. What we chang’d
==69==Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
==70==The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d
==71==That any did. Had we pursu’d that life,
==72==And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d
==73==With stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven
==74==Boldly, “Not guilty”; the imposition clear’d,
==75==Hereditary ours.

**HER.**
==75==           By this we gather
==76==You have tripp’d since.

**POL.**
==76==              O my most sacred lady,
==77==Temptations have since then been born to ’s: for
==78==In those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl;
==79==Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes
==80==Of my young playfellow.

**HER.**
==80==              Grace to boot!
==81==Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
==82==Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on,
==83==Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,
==84==If you first sinn’d with us, and that with us
==85==You did continue fault, and that you slipp’d not
==86==With any but with us.

**LEON.**
==86==           Is he won yet?

**HER.**
==87==He’ll stay, my lord.

**LEON.**
==87==           At my request he would not.
==88==Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st
==89==To better purpose.

**HER.**
==89==           Never?

**LEON.**
==89==                Never, but once.

**HER.**
==90==What? Have I twice said well? When was’t before?
==91==I prithee tell me; cram ’s with praise, and make ’s
==92==As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless
==93==Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
==94==Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s
==95==With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
==96==With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:
==97==My last good deed was to entreat his stay;
==98==What was my first? It has an elder sister,
==99==Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!
==100==But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When?
==101==Nay, let me have’t; I long.

**LEON.**
==101==              Why, that was when
==102==Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,
==103==Ere I could make thee open thy white hand,
==104==And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter,
==105==“I am yours forever.”

**HER.**
==105==              ’Tis Grace indeed.
==106==Why, lo you now! I have spoke to th’ purpose twice:
==107==The one forever earn’d a royal husband;
==108==Th’ other for some while a friend.

*Gives her hand to Polixenes.*

**LEON.**
*(Aside.)*
==108==                  Too hot, too hot!
==109==To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
==110==I have *tremor cordis* on me; my heart dances,
==111==But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
==112==May a free face put on, derive a liberty
==113==From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
==114==And well become the agent; ’t may—I grant.
==115==But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
==116==As now they are, and making practic’d smiles,
==117==As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as ’twere
==118==The mort o’ th’ deer—O, that is entertainment
==119==My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
==120==Art thou my boy?

**MAM.**
==120==        Ay, my good lord.

**LEON.**
==120==                     I’ fecks!
==121==Why, that’s my bawcock. What? Hast smutch’d thy nose?
==122==They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
==123==We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
==124==And yet the steer, the heckfer, and the calf
==125==Are all call’d neat.—Still virginalling
==126==Upon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf,
==127==Art thou my calf?

**MAM.**
==127==           Yes, if you will, my lord.

**LEON.**
==128==Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
==129==To be full like me; yet they say we are
==130==Almost as like as eggs; women say so⁠—
==131==That will say any thing. But were they false
==132==As o’er-dy’d blacks, as wind, as waters, false
==133==As dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes
==134==No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true
==135==To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
==136==Look on me with your welkin eye. Sweet villain!
==137==Most dear’st! My collop! Can thy dam?—may’t be?⁠—
==138==Affection! Thy intention stabs the center.
==139==Thou dost make possible things not so held,
==140==Communicat’st with dreams (how can this be?),
==141==With what’s unreal thou co-active art,
==142==And fellow’st nothing. Then ’tis very credent
==143==Thou mayst co-join with something, and thou dost
==144==(And that beyond commission), and I find it
==145==(And that to the infection of my brains
==146==And hard’ning of my brows).

**POL.**
==146==                What means Sicilia?

**HER.**
==147==He something seems unsettled.

**POL.**
==147==                How? My lord?

**LEON.**
==148==What cheer? How is’t with you, best brother?

**HER.**
==148==                       You look
==149==As if you held a brow of much distraction.
==150==Are you mov’d, my lord?

**LEON.**
==150==              No, in good earnest.
==151==How sometimes nature will betray its folly!
==152==Its tenderness! And make itself a pastime
==153==To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
==154==Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil
==155==Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d
==156==In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
==157==Lest it should bite its master, and so prove
==158==(As ornament oft does) too dangerous.
==159==How like (methought) I then was to this kernel,
==160==This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
==161==Will you take eggs for money?

**MAM.**
==162==No, my lord, I’ll fight.

**LEON.**
==163==You will? Why, happy man be ’s dole! My brother,
==164==Are you so fond of your young prince as we
==165==Do seem to be of ours?

**POL.**
==165==              If at home, sir,
==166==He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter;
==167==Now my sworn friend, and then mine enemy;
==168==My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all.
==169==He makes a July’s day short as December,
==170==And with his varying childness cures in me
==171==Thoughts that would thick my blood.

**LEON.**
==171==                     So stands this squire
==172==Offic’d with me. We two will walk, my lord,
==173==And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
==174==How thou lov’st us, show in our brother’s welcome;
==175==Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap.
==176==Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s
==177==Apparent to my heart.

**HER.**
==177==              If you would seek us,
==178==We are yours i’ th’ garden. Shall ’s attend you there?

**LEON.**
==179==To your own bents dispose you; you’ll be found,
==180==Be you beneath the sky.
*(Aside.)*
==180==              I am angling now,
==181==Though you perceive me not how I give line.
==182==Go to, go to!
==183==How she holds up the neb! The bill to him!
==184==And arms her with the boldness of a wife
==185==To her allowing husband!
*(Exeunt Polixenes, Hermione, and Attendants.)*
==185==                Gone already!
==186==Inch-thick, knee-deep, o’er head and ears a fork’d one!
==187==Go play, boy, play. Thy mother plays, and I
==188==Play too, but so disgrac’d a part, whose issue
==189==Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamor
==190==Will be my knell. Go play, boy, play. There have been
==191==(Or I am much deceiv’d) cuckolds ere now,
==192==And many a man there is (even at this present,
==193==Now, while I speak this) holds his wife by th’ arm,
==194==That little thinks she has been sluic’d in ’s absence,
==195==And his pond fish’d by his next neighbor—by
==196==Sir Smile, his neighbor. Nay, there’s comfort in’t,
==197==Whiles other men have gates, and those gates open’d,
==198==As mine, against their will. Should all despair
==199==That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
==200==Would hang themselves. Physic for’t there’s none.
==201==It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
==202==Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis pow’rful—think it⁠—
==203==From east, west, north, and south. Be it concluded,
==204==No barricado for a belly. Know’t,
==205==It will let in and out the enemy,
==206==With bag and baggage. Many thousand on ’s
==207==Have the disease, and feel’t not. How now, boy?

**MAM.**
==208==I am like you, they say.

**LEON.**
==208==              Why, that’s some comfort.
==209==What? Camillo there?

**CAM.**
==210==Ay, my good lord.

**LEON.**
==211==Go play, Mamillius, thou’rt an honest man.
*(Exit Mamillius.)*
==212==Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

**CAM.**
==213==You had much ado to make his anchor hold,
==214==When you cast out, it still came home.

**LEON.**
==214==                     Didst note it?

**CAM.**
==215==He would not stay at your petitions, made
==216==His business more material.

**LEON.**
==216==                Didst perceive it?
*(Aside.)*
==217==They’re here with me already, whisp’ring, rounding:
==218==“Sicilia is a so-forth.” ’Tis far gone,
==219==When I shall gust it last.—How came’t, Camillo,
==220==That he did stay?

**CAM.**
==220==           At the good Queen’s entreaty.

**LEON.**
==221==At the Queen’s be’t; “good” should be pertinent,
==222==But so it is, it is not. Was this taken
==223==By any understanding pate but thine?
==224==For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
==225==More than the common blocks. Not noted, is’t,
==226==But of the finer natures? By some severals
==227==Of head-piece extraordinary? Lower messes
==228==Perchance are to this business purblind? Say.

**CAM.**
==229==Business, my lord? I think most understand
==230==Bohemia stays here longer.

**LEON.**
==230==                Ha?

**CAM.**
==230==                  Stays here longer.

**LEON.**
==231==Ay, but why?

**CAM.**
==232==To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties
==233==Of our most gracious mistress.

**LEON.**
==233==                  Satisfy?
==234==Th’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?
==235==Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
==236==With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
==237==My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
==238==Hast cleans’d my bosom: I from thee departed
==239==Thy penitent reform’d. But we have been
==240==Deceiv’d in thy integrity, deceiv’d
==241==In that which seems so.

**CAM.**
==241==           Be it forbid, my lord!

**LEON.**
==242==To bide upon’t: thou art not honest; or
==243==If thou inclin’st that way, thou art a coward,
==244==Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
==245==From course requir’d; or else thou must be counted
==246==A servant grafted in my serious trust
==247==And therein negligent; or else a fool,
==248==That seest a game play’d home, the rich stake drawn,
==249==And tak’st it all for jest.

**CAM.**
==249==              My gracious lord,
==250==I may be negligent, foolish, and fearful:
==251==In every one of these no man is free
==252==But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
==253==Among the infinite doings of the world,
==254==Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
==255==If ever I were willful-negligent,
==256==It was my folly; if industriously
==257==I play’d the fool, it was my negligence,
==258==Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
==259==To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
==260==Whereof the execution did cry out
==261==Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear
==262==Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
==263==Are such allow’d infirmities that honesty
==264==Is never free of. But beseech your Grace
==265==Be plainer with me, let me know my trespass
==266==By its own visage. If I then deny it,
==267==’Tis none of mine.

**LEON.**
==267==           Ha’ not you seen, Camillo
==268==(But that’s past doubt; you have, or your eye-glass
==269==Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn), or heard
==270==(For to a vision so apparent rumor
==271==Cannot be mute), or thought (for cogitation
==272==Resides not in that man that does not think) 
==273==My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
==274==Or else be impudently negative,
==275==To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
==276==My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name
==277==As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
==278==Before her troth-plight: say’t and justify’t.

**CAM.**
==279==I would not be a stander-by to hear
==280==My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
==281==My present vengeance taken. ’Shrew my heart,
==282==You never spoke what did become you less
==283==Than this; which to reiterate were sin
==284==As deep as that, though true.

**LEON.**
==284==                Is whispering nothing?
==285==Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
==286==Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career
==287==Of laughter with a sigh (a note infallible
==288==Of breaking honesty)? Horsing foot on foot?
==289==Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift?
==290==Hours, minutes? Noon, midnight? And all eyes
==291==Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
==292==That would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing?
==293==Why then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing,
==294==The covering sky is nothing, Bohemia nothing,
==295==My wife is nothing, nor nothing have these nothings,
==296==If this be nothing.

**CAM.**
==296==           Good my lord, be cur’d
==297==Of this diseas’d opinion, and betimes,
==298==For ’tis most dangerous.

**LEON.**
==298==              Say it be, ’tis true.

**CAM.**
==299==No, no, my lord.

**LEON.**
==299==           It is: you lie, you lie!
==300==I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
==301==Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
==302==Or else a hovering temporizer, that
==303==Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
==304==Inclining to them both. Were my wive’s liver
==305==Infected as her life, she would not live
==306==The running of one glass.

**CAM.**
==306==              Who does infect her?

**LEON.**
==307==Why, he that wears her like her medal hanging
==308==About his neck, Bohemia—who, if I
==309==Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
==310==To see alike mine honor as their profits
==311==(Their own particular thrifts), they would do that
==312==Which should undo more doing; ay, and thou,
==313==His cupbearer—whom I from meaner form
==314==Have bench’d and rear’d to worship, who mayst see
==315==Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
==316==How I am gall’d—mightst bespice a cup,
==317==To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
==318==Which draught to me were cordial.

**CAM.**
==318==                  Sir, my lord,
==319==I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
==320==But with a ling’ring dram that should not work
==321==Maliciously, like poison; but I cannot
==322==Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
==323==(So sovereignly being honorable).
==324==I have lov’d thee⁠—

**LEON.**
==324==        Make that thy question, and go rot!
==325==Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
==326==To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
==327==The purity and whiteness of my sheets
==328==(Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
==329==Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps),
==330==Give scandal to the blood o’ th’ Prince my son
==331==(Who I do think is mine and love as mine),
==332==Without ripe moving to’t? Would I do this?
==333==Could man so blench?

**CAM.**
==333==           I must believe you, sir.
==334==I do, and will fetch off Bohemia for’t;
==335==Provided that, when he’s remov’d, your Highness
==336==Will take again your queen as yours at first,
==337==Even for your son’s sake, and thereby for sealing
==338==The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
==339==Known and allied to yours.

**LEON.**
==339==              Thou dost advise me
==340==Even so as I mine own course have set down.
==341==I’ll give no blemish to her honor, none.

**CAM.**
==342==My lord,
==343==Go then; and with a countenance as clear
==344==As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
==345==And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
==346==If from me he have wholesome beverage,
==347==Account me not your servant.

**LEON.**
==347==                  This is all:
==348==Do’t, and thou hast the one half of my heart;
==349==Do’t not, thou split’st thine own.

**CAM.**
==349==                  I’ll do’t, my lord.

**LEON.**
==350==I will seem friendly, as thou hast advis’d me.

*Exit.*

**CAM.**
==351==O miserable lady! But for me,
==352==What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
==353==Of good Polixenes, and my ground to do’t
==354==Is the obedience to a master; one
==355==Who, in rebellion with himself, will have
==356==All that are his so too. To do this deed,
==357==Promotion follows. If I could find example
==358==Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
==359==And flourish’d after, I’ld not do’t; but since
==360==Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
==361==Let villainy itself forswear’t. I must
==362==Forsake the court. To do’t, or no, is certain
==363==To me a break-neck. Happy star reign now!
==364==Here comes Bohemia.

*Enter Polixenes.*

**POL.**
==364==              This is strange; methinks
==365==My favor here begins to warp. Not speak?
==366==Good day, Camillo.

**CAM.**
==366==           Hail, most royal sir!

**POL.**
==367==What is the news i’ th’ court?

**CAM.**
==367==                None rare, my lord.

**POL.**
==368==The King hath on him such a countenance
==369==As he had lost some province and a region
==370==Lov’d as he loves himself. Even now I met him
==371==With customary compliment, when he,
==372==Wafting his eyes to th’ contrary and falling
==373==A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and
==374==So leaves me to consider what is breeding
==375==That changes thus his manners.

**CAM.**
==376==I dare not know, my lord.

**POL.**
==377==How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not?
==378==Be intelligent to me, ’tis thereabouts:
==379==For to yourself, what you do know, you must,
==380==And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,
==381==Your chang’d complexions are to me a mirror
==382==Which shows me mine chang’d too; for I must be
==383==A party in this alteration, finding
==384==Myself thus alter’d with’t.

**CAM.**
==384==              There is a sickness
==385==Which puts some of us in distemper, but
==386==I cannot name the disease, and it is caught
==387==Of you that yet are well.

**POL.**
==387==              How caught of me?
==388==Make me not sighted like the basilisk.
==389==I have look’d on thousands, who have sped the better
==390==By my regard, but kill’d none so. Camillo,
==391==As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
==392==Clerk-like experienc’d, which no less adorns
==393==Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,
==394==In whose success we are gentle, I beseech you,
==395==If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
==396==Thereof to be inform’d, imprison’t not
==397==In ignorant concealment.

**CAM.**
==397==              I may not answer.

**POL.**
==398==A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?
==399==I must be answer’d. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
==400==I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
==401==Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least
==402==Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
==403==What incidency thou dost guess of harm
==404==Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near,
==405==Which way to be prevented, if to be;
==406==If not, how best to bear it.

**CAM.**
==406==              Sir, I will tell you,
==407==Since I am charg’d in honor and by him
==408==That I think honorable. Therefore mark my counsel,
==409==Which must be ev’n as swiftly followed as
==410==I mean to utter it; or both yourself and me
==411==Cry lost, and so good night!

**POL.**
==411==                On, good Camillo.

**CAM.**
==412==I am appointed him to murder you.

**POL.**
==413==By whom, Camillo?

**CAM.**
==413==           By the King.

**POL.**
==413==                     For what?

**CAM.**
==414==He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
==415==As he had seen’t or been an instrument
==416==To vice you to’t, that you have touch’d his queen
==417==Forbiddenly.

**POL.**
==417==        O then, my best blood turn
==418==To an infected jelly, and my name
==419==Be yok’d with his that did betray the Best!
==420==Turn then my freshest reputation to
==421==A savor that may strike the dullest nostril
==422==Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,
==423==Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection
==424==That e’er was heard or read!

**CAM.**
==424==                Swear his thought over
==425==By each particular star in heaven, and
==426==By all their influences, you may as well
==427==Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
==428==As or by oath remove or counsel shake
==429==The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
==430==Is pil’d upon his faith, and will continue
==431==The standing of his body.

**POL.**
==431==              How should this grow?

**CAM.**
==432==I know not; but I am sure ’tis safer to
==433==Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.
==434==If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
==435==That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
==436==Shall bear along impawn’d, away tonight!
==437==Your followers I will whisper to the business,
==438==And will by twos and threes at several posterns
==439==Clear them o’ th’ city. For myself, I’ll put
==440==My fortunes to your service, which are here
==441==By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,
==442==For by the honor of my parents, I
==443==Have utt’red truth; which if you seek to prove,
==444==I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
==445==Than one condemn’d by the King’s own mouth—thereon
==446==His execution sworn.

**POL.**
==446==              I do believe thee:
==447==I saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand,
==448==Be pilot to me, and thy places shall
==449==Still neighbor mine. My ships are ready, and
==450==My people did expect my hence departure
==451==Two days ago. This jealousy
==452==Is for a precious creature: as she’s rare,
==453==Must it be great; and as his person’s mighty,
==454==Must it be violent; and as he does conceive
==455==He is dishonor’d by a man which ever
==456==Profess’d to him, why, his revenges must
==457==In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me.
==458==Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
==459==The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
==460==Of his ill-ta’en suspicion! Come, Camillo,
==461==I will respect thee as a father, if
==462==Thou bear’st my life off. Hence! Let us avoid.

**CAM.**
==463==It is in mine authority to command
==464==The keys of all the posterns. Please your Highness
==465==To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

*Exeunt.*
