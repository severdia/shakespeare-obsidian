## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Sicilia. A room in Leontes’ palace.*

*Enter Leontes; Servants keeping the door.*

**LEON.**
==1== Nor night, nor day, no rest. It is but weakness
==2== To bear the matter thus—mere weakness. If
==3== The cause were not in being—part o’ th’ cause,
==4== She th’ adult’ress; for the harlot king
==5== Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
==6== And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
==7== I can hook to me—say that she were gone,
==8== Given to the fire, a moi’ty of my rest
==9== Might come to me again. Who’s there?

**1. SERV.**
*(Advancing.)*
==9==                      My lord?

**LEON.**
==10== How does the boy?

**1. SERV.**
==10==            He took good rest tonight;
==11== ’Tis hop’d his sickness is discharg’d.

**LEON.**
==12== To see his nobleness,
==13== Conceiving the dishonor of his mother!
==14== He straight declin’d, droop’d, took it deeply,
==15== Fasten’d and fix’d the shame on’t in himself,
==16== Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
==17== And downright languish’d. Leave me solely; go,
==18== See how he fares.
*(Exit First Servant.)*
==18==            Fie, fie, no thought of him;
==19== The very thought of my revenges that way
==20== Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
==21== And in his parties, his alliance. Let him be,
==22== Until a time may serve. For present vengeance,
==23== Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
==24== Laugh at me; make their pastime at my sorrow:
==25== They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
==26== Shall she, within my pow’r.

*Enter Paulina with a child; Antigonus and Lords endeavoring to hold her back.*

**1. LORD.**
==26==                 You must not enter.

**PAUL.**
==27== Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me.
==28== Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
==29== Than the Queen’s life? A gracious innocent soul,
==30== More free than he is jealous.

**ANT.**
==30==                 That’s enough.

**2. SERV.**
==31== Madam—he hath not slept tonight, commanded
==32== None should come at him.

**PAUL.**
==32==               Not so hot, good sir,
==33== I come to bring him sleep. ’Tis such as you,
==34== That creep like shadows by him, and do sigh
==35== At each his needless heavings, such as you
==36== Nourish the cause of his awaking. I
==37== Do come with words as medicinal as true,
==38== Honest as either, to purge him of that humor
==39== That presses him from sleep.

**LEON.**
==39==                 What noise there, ho?

**PAUL.**
==40== No noise, my lord, but needful conference
==41== About some gossips for your Highness.

**LEON.**
==41==                      How?
==42== Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
==43== I charg’d thee that she should not come about me:
==44== I knew she would.

**ANT.**
==44==            I told her so, my lord,
==45== On your displeasure’s peril and on mine,
==46== She should not visit you.

**LEON.**
==46==               What? Canst not rule her?

**PAUL.**
==47== From all dishonesty he can. In this,
==48== Unless he take the course that you have done⁠—
==49== Commit me for committing honor—trust it,
==50== He shall not rule me.

**ANT.**
==50==            La you now, you hear!
==51== When she will take the rein I let her run,
*(Aside.)*
==52== But she’ll not stumble.

**PAUL.**
==52==               Good my liege, I come⁠—
==53== And I beseech you hear me, who professes
==54== Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
==55== Your most obedient counsellor; yet that dares
==56== Less appear so, in comforting your evils,
==57== Than such as most seem yours—I say, I come
==58== From your good queen.

**LEON.**
==59== Good queen?

**PAUL.**
==60== Good queen, my lord, good queen, I say good queen,
==61== And would by combat make her good, so were I
==62== A man, the worst about you.

**LEON.**
==62==                 Force her hence.

**PAUL.**
==63== Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
==64== First hand me. On mine own accord I’ll off,
==65== But first I’ll do my errand. The good queen
==66== (For she is good) hath brought you forth a daughter⁠—
==67== Here ’tis—commends it to your blessing.

*Laying down the child.*

**LEON.**
==67==                          Out!
==68== A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o’ door!
==69== A most intelligencing bawd!

**PAUL.**
==69==                 Not so.
==70== I am as ignorant in that, as you
==71== In so entit’ling me; and no less honest
==72== Than you are mad; which is enough, I’ll warrant
==73== (As this world goes), to pass for honest.

**LEON.**
==73==                        Traitors!
==74== Will you not push her out?
*(To Antigonus.)*
==74==                 Give her the bastard,
==75== Thou dotard, thou art woman-tir’d; unroosted
==76== By thy Dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard,
==77== Take’t up, I say; give’t to thy crone.

**PAUL.**
==77==                   For ever
==78== Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
==79== Tak’st up the Princess by that forced baseness
==80== Which he has put upon’t!

**LEON.**
==80==               He dreads his wife.

**PAUL.**
==81== So I would you did; then ’twere past all doubt
==82== You’ld call your children yours.

**LEON.**
==82==                   A nest of traitors!

**ANT.**
==83== I am none, by this good light.

**PAUL.**
==83==                 Nor I, nor any
==84== But one that’s here—and that’s himself; for he
==85== The sacred honor of himself, his queen’s,
==86== His hopeful son’s, his babe’s, betrays to slander,
==87== Whose sting is sharper than the sword’s, and will not
==88== (For as the case now stands, it is a curse
==89== He cannot be compell’d to’t) once remove
==90== The root of his opinion, which is rotten
==91== As ever oak or stone was sound.

**LEON.**
==91==                   A callat
==92== Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband,
==93== And now baits me! This brat is none of mine,
==94== It is the issue of Polixenes.
==95== Hence with it, and together with the dam
==96== Commit them to the fire!

**PAUL.**
==96==               It is yours:
==97== And might we lay th’ old proverb to your charge,
==98== So like you, ’tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
==99== Although the print be little, the whole matter
==100== And copy of the father—eye, nose, lip,
==101== The trick of ’s frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
==102== The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek, his smiles,
==103== The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger.
==104== And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
==105== So like to him that got it, if thou hast
==106== The ordering of the mind too, ’mongst all colors
==107== No yellow in’t, lest she suspect, as he does,
==108== Her children not her husband’s!

**LEON.**
==108==                   A gross hag!
==109== And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang’d,
==110== That wilt not stay her tongue.

**ANT.**
==110==                 Hang all the husbands
==111== That cannot do that feat, you’ll leave yourself
==112== Hardly one subject.

**LEON.**
==112==            Once more, take her hence.

**PAUL.**
==113== A most unworthy and unnatural lord
==114== Can do no more.

**LEON.**
==114==            I’ll ha’ thee burnt.

**PAUL.**
==114==                      I care not:
==115== It is an heretic that makes the fire,
==116== Not she which burns in’t. I’ll not call you tyrant;
==117== But this most cruel usage of your queen
==118== (Not able to produce more accusation
==119== Than your own weak-hing’d fancy) something savors
==120== Of tyranny, and will ignoble make you,
==121== Yea, scandalous to the world.

**LEON.**
==121==                 On your allegiance,
==122== Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
==123== Where were her life? She durst not call me so,
==124== If she did know me one. Away with her!

**PAUL.**
==125== I pray you do not push me, I’ll be gone.
==126== Look to your babe, my lord, ’tis yours. Jove send her
==127== A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
==128== You, that are thus so tender o’er his follies,
==129== Will never do him good, not one of you.
==130== So, so. Farewell, we are gone.

*Exit.*

**LEON.**
==131== Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
==132== My child? Away with’t! Even thou, that hast
==133== A heart so tender o’er it, take it hence,
==134== And see it instantly consum’d with fire.
==135== Even thou, and none but thou. Take it up straight.
==136== Within this hour bring me word ’tis done
==137== (And by good testimony), or I’ll seize thy life,
==138== With what thou else call’st thine. If thou refuse
==139== And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
==140== The bastard brains with these my proper hands
==141== Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire,
==142== For thou set’st on thy wife.

**ANT.**
==142==               I did not, sir.
==143== These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
==144== Can clear me in’t.

**LORDS.**
==144==            We can. My royal liege,
==145== He is not guilty of her coming hither.

**LEON.**
==146== You’re liars all.

**1. LORD.**
==147== Beseech your Highness, give us better credit.
==148== We have always truly serv’d you, and beseech’
==149== So to esteem of us; and on our knees we beg
==150== (As recompense of our dear services
==151== Past and to come) that you do change this purpose,
==152== Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
==153== Lead on to some foul issue. We all kneel.

**LEON.**
==154== I am a feather for each wind that blows.
==155== Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
==156== And call me father? Better burn it now
==157== Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
==158== It shall not neither.
*(To Antigonus.)*
==158==            You, sir, come you hither:
==159== You that have been so tenderly officious
==160== With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
==161== To save this bastard’s life—for ’tis a bastard,
==162== So sure as this beard’s grey—what will you adventure
==163== To save this brat’s life?

**ANT.**
==163==               Any thing, my lord,
==164== That my ability may undergo
==165== And nobleness impose; at least thus much:
==166== I’ll pawn the little blood which I have left
==167== To save the innocent—any thing possible.

**LEON.**
==168== It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
==169== Thou wilt perform my bidding.

**ANT.**
==169==                   I will, my lord.

**LEON.**
==170== Mark and perform it—seest thou? For the fail
==171== Of any point in’t shall not only be
==172== Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongu’d wife,
==173== Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
==174== As thou art liegeman to us, that thou carry
==175== This female bastard hence, and that thou bear it
==176== To some remote and desert place quite out
==177== Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it
==178== (Without more mercy) to it own protection,
==179== And favor of the climate. As by strange fortune
==180== It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
==181== On thy soul’s peril, and thy body’s torture,
==182== That thou commend it strangely to some place
==183== Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

**ANT.**
==184== I swear to do this—though a present death
==185== Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe.
==186== Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
==187== To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say,
==188== Casting their savageness aside, have done
==189== Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
==190== In more than this deed does require! And blessing
==191== Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
==192== Poor thing, condemn’d to loss!

*Exit with the child.*

**LEON.**
==192==                   No! I’ll not rear
==193== Another’s issue.

*Enter Third Servant.*

**3. SERV.**
==193==         Please’ your Highness, posts
==194== From those you sent to th’ oracle are come
==195== An hour since. Cleomines and Dion,
==196== Being well arriv’d from Delphos, are both landed,
==197== Hasting to th’ court.

**1. LORD.**
==197==            So please you, sir, their speed
==198== Hath been beyond accompt.

**LEON.**
==198==               Twenty-three days
==199== They have been absent. ’Tis good speed; foretells
==200== The great Apollo suddenly will have
==201== The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords,
==202== Summon a session, that we may arraign
==203== Our most disloyal lady; for as she hath
==204== Been publicly accus’d, so shall she have
==205== A just and open trial. While she lives
==206== My heart will be a burden to me. Leave me,
==207== And think upon my bidding.

*Exeunt.*
