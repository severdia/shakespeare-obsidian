## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*A hall in York Place.*

*Hoboys. A small table under a state for the Cardinal, a longer table for the guests.*

*Then enter Anne Boleyn and diverse other Ladies and Gentlemen as guests, at one door; at another door, enter Sir Henry Guilford.*

**GUIL.**
==1==Ladies, a general welcome from his Grace
==2==Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates
==3==To fair content and you. None here, he hopes,
==4==In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
==5==One care abroad. He would have all as merry
==6==As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,
==7==Can make good people.
*(Enter Lord Chamberlain, Lord Sands, and Lovell.)*
==7==              O my lord, y’ are tardy;
==8==The very thought of this fair company
==9==Clapp’d wings to me.

**CHAM.**
==9==           You are young, Sir Harry Guilford.

**SAN.**
==10==Sir Thomas Lovell, had the Cardinal
==11==But half my lay-thoughts in him, some of these
==12==Should find a running banquet, ere they rested,
==13==I think would better please ’em. By my life,
==14==They are a sweet society of fair ones.

**LOV.**
==15==O that your lordship were but now confessor
==16==To one or two of these!

**SAN.**
==16==           I would I were,
==17==They should find easy penance.

**LOV.**
==17==                  Faith, how easy?

**SAN.**
==18==As easy as a down-bed would afford it.

**CHAM.**
==19==Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
==20==Place you that side, I’ll take the charge of this.
==21==His Grace is ent’ring. Nay, you must not freeze,
==22==Two women plac’d together makes cold weather.
==23==My Lord Sands, you are one will keep ’em waking;
==24==Pray sit between these ladies.

**SAN.**
==24==                By my faith,
==25==And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies.
==26==If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
==27==I had it from my father.

**ANNE.**
==27==              Was he mad, sir?

**SAN.**
==28==O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too;
==29==But he would bite none. Just as I do now,
==30==He would kiss you twenty with a breath.

*Kisses her.*

**CHAM.**
==30==                Well said, my lord.
==31==So now y’ are fairly seated. Gentlemen,
==32==The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies
==33==Pass away frowning.

**SAN.**
==33==           For my little cure,
==34==Let me alone.

*Hoboys. Enter Cardinal Wolsey and takes his state.*

**WOL.**
==35==Y’ are welcome, my fair guests. That noble lady
==36==Or gentleman that is not freely merry
==37==Is not my friend. This, to confirm my welcome,
==38==And to you all good health.

*Drinks.*

**SAN.**
==38==                Your Grace is noble.
==39==Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
==40==And save me so much talking.

**WOL.**
==40==                My Lord Sands,
==41==I am beholding to you; cheer your neighbors.
==42==Ladies, you are not merry. Gentlemen,
==43==Whose fault is this?

**SAN.**
==43==           The red wine first must rise
==44==In their fair cheeks, my lord, then we shall have ’em
==45==Talk us to silence.

**ANNE.**
==45==           You are a merry gamester,
==46==My Lord Sands.

**SAN.**
==46==           Yes, if I make my play.
==47==Here’s to your ladyship, and pledge it, madam,
==48==For ’tis to such a thing⁠—

**ANNE.**
==48==              You cannot show me.

**SAN.**
==49==I told your Grace they would talk anon.

*Drum and trumpet; chambers discharg’d.*

**WOL.**
==49==                     What’s that?

**CHAM.**
==50==Look out there, some of ye.

*Exit a Servant.*

**WOL.**
==50==                What warlike voice,
==51==And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;
==52==By all the laws of war y’ are privileg’d.

*Enter a Servant.*

**CHAM.**
==53==How now, what is’t?

**SERV.**
==53==           A noble troop of strangers,
==54==For so they seem. Th’ have left their barge and landed,
==55==And hither make, as great ambassadors
==56==From foreign princes.

**WOL.**
==56==              Good Lord Chamberlain,
==57==Go, give ’em welcome: you can speak the French tongue;
==58==And pray receive ’em nobly and conduct ’em
==59==Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty
==60==Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.
*(Exit Chamberlain attended.)*
*(All rise, and tables remov’d.)*
==61==You have now a broken banquet, but we’ll mend it.
==62==A good digestion to you all; and once more
==63==I show’r a welcome on ye. Welcome all!
*(Hoboys. Enter King and others as Maskers, habited like shepherds, usher’d by the Lord Chamberlain.)*
*(They pass directly before the Cardinal and gracefully salute him.)*
==64==A noble company! What are their pleasures?

**CHAM.**
==65==Because they speak no English, thus they pray’d
==66==To tell your Grace, that having heard by fame
==67==Of this so noble and so fair assembly
==68==This night to meet here, they could do no less
==69==(Out of the great respect they bear to beauty) 
==70==But leave their flocks, and under your fair conduct
==71==Crave leave to view these ladies, and entreat
==72==An hour of revels with’em.

**WOL.**
==72==              Say, Lord Chamberlain,
==73==They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay ’em
==74==A thousand thanks, and pray ’em take their pleasures.

*Choose ladies; King and Anne Boleyn.*

**KING.**
==75==The fairest hand I ever touch’d! O Beauty,
==76==Till now I never knew thee!

*Music. Dance.*

**WOL.**
==77==My lord!

**CHAM.**
==77==    Your Grace?

**WOL.**
==77==        Pray tell ’em thus much from me:
==78==There should be one amongst ’em, by his person
==79==More worthy this place than myself, to whom
==80==(If I but knew him) with my love and duty
==81==I would surrender it.

**CHAM.**
==81==           I will, my lord.

*Whisper with the Maskers.*

**WOL.**
==82==What say they?

**CHAM.**
==82==        Such a one, they all confess,
==83==There is indeed, which they would have your Grace
==84==Find out, and he will take it.

**WOL.**
==84==                Let me see then,
==85==By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I’ll make
==86==My royal choice.

**KING.**
==86==           Ye have found him, Cardinal.
*(Unmasking.)*
==87==You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord.
==88==You are a churchman, or I’ll tell you, Cardinal,
==89==I should judge now unhappily.

**WOL.**
==89==                I am glad
==90==Your Grace is grown so pleasant.

**KING.**
==90==                  My Lord Chamberlain,
==91==Prithee come hither. What fair lady’s that?

**CHAM.**
==92==An’t please your Grace, Sir Thomas Boleyn’s daughter⁠—
==93==The Viscount Rochford—one of her Highness’ women.

**KING.**
==94==By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweet heart,
==95==I were unmannerly to take you out
==96==And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!
==97==Let it go round.

**WOL.**
==98==Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
==99==I’ th’ privy chamber?

**LOV.**
==99==           Yes, my lord.

**WOL.**
==99==                     Your Grace,
==100==I fear, with dancing is a little heated.

**KING.**
==101==I fear, too much.

**WOL.**
==101==           There’s fresher air, my lord,
==102==In the next chamber.

**KING.**
==103==Lead in your ladies, ev’ry one. Sweet partner,
==104==I must not yet forsake you. Let’s be merry,
==105==Good my Lord Cardinal: I have half a dozen healths
==106==To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure
==107==To lead ’em once again, and then let’s dream
==108==Who’s best in favor. Let the music knock it.

*Exeunt with Trumpets.*
