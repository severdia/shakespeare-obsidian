## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*London. A gallery in the palace.*

*Enter Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, Gardiner’s Page with a torch before him, met by Sir Thomas Lovell.*

**BISH. WIN.**
==1==It’s one a’ clock, boy, is’t not?

**GARD. PAGE.**
==1==                It hath struck.

**BISH. WIN.**
==2==These should be hours for necessities,
==3==Not for delights; times to repair our nature
==4==With comforting repose, and not for us
==5==To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!
==6==Whither so late?

**LOV.**
==6==        Came you from the King, my lord?

**BISH. WIN.**
==7==I did, Sir Thomas, and left him at primero
==8==With the Duke of Suffolk.

**LOV.**
==8==              I must to him too,
==9==Before he go to bed. I’ll take my leave.

**BISH. WIN.**
==10==Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What’s the matter?
==11==It seems you are in haste. And if there be
==12==No great offense belongs to’t, give your friend
==13==Some touch of your late business. Affairs that walk
==14==(As they say spirits do) at midnight, have
==15==In them a wilder nature than the business
==16==That seeks dispatch by day.

**LOV.**
==16==              My lord, I love you;
==17==And durst commend a secret to your ear
==18==Much weightier than this work. The Queen’s in labor,
==19==They say in great extremity, and fear’d
==20==She’ll with the labor end.

**BISH. WIN.**
==20==              The fruit she goes with
==21==I pray for heartily, that it may find
==22==Good time, and live; but for the stock, Sir Thomas,
==23==I wish it grubb’d up now.

**LOV.**
==23==              Methinks I could
==24==Cry the amen, and yet my conscience says
==25==She’s a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
==26==Deserve our better wishes.

**BISH. WIN.**
==26==              But, sir, sir,
==27==Hear me, Sir Thomas, y’ are a gentleman
==28==Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious,
==29==And, let me tell you, it will ne’er be well⁠—
==30==’Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take’t of me⁠—
==31==Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she
==32==Sleep in their graves.

**LOV.**
==32==           Now, sir, you speak of two
==33==The most remark’d i’ th’ kingdom. As for Cromwell,
==34==Beside that of the Jewel House, is made Master
==35==O’ th’ Rolls, and the King’s secretary; further, sir,
==36==Stands in the gap and trade of more preferments,
==37==With which the time will load him. Th’ Archbishop
==38==Is the King’s hand and tongue, and who dare speak
==39==One syllable against him?

**BISH. WIN.**
==39==              Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,
==40==There are that dare, and I myself have ventur’d
==41==To speak my mind of him; and indeed this day,
==42==Sir (I may tell it you), I think I have
==43==Incens’d the lords o’ th’ Council that he is
==44==(For so I know he is, they know he is) 
==45==A most arch-heretic, a pestilence
==46==That does infect the land; with which they moved
==47==Have broken with the King, who hath so far
==48==Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace
==49==And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
==50==Our reasons laid before him, ’hath commanded
==51==Tomorrow morning to the Council-board
==52==He be convented. He’s a rank weed, Sir Thomas,
==53==And we must root him out. From your affairs
==54==I hinder you too long. Good night, Sir Thomas.

**LOV.**
==55==Many good-nights, my lord! I rest your servant.

*Exeunt the Bishop of Winchester, and Gardiner’s Page.*

*Enter King and Suffolk.*

**KING.**
==56==Charles, I will play no more tonight,
==57==My mind’s not on’t, you are too hard for me.

**SUF.**
==58==Sir, I did never win of you before.

**KING.**
==59==But little, Charles,
==60==Nor shall not, when my fancy’s on my play.
==61==Now, Lovell, from the Queen what is the news?

**LOV.**
==62==I could not personally deliver to her
==63==What you commanded me, but by her woman
==64==I sent your message, who return’d her thanks
==65==In the great’st humbleness, and desir’d your Highness
==66==Most heartily to pray for her.

**KING.**
==66==                What say’st thou? Ha?
==67==To pray for her? What, is she crying out?

**LOV.**
==68==So said her woman, and that her suff’rance made
==69==Almost each pang a death.

**KING.**
==69==              Alas, good lady!

**SUF.**
==70==God safely quit her of her burden, and
==71==With gentle travail, to the gladding of
==72==Your Highness with an heir!

**KING.**
==72==              ’Tis midnight, Charles,
==73==Prithee to bed, and in thy pray’rs remember
==74==Th’ estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone,
==75==For I must think of that which company
==76==Would not be friendly to.

**SUF.**
==76==              I wish your Highness
==77==A quiet night, and my good mistress will
==78==Remember in my prayers.

**KING.**
==78==              Charles, good night.
*(Exit Suffolk.)*
*(Enter Sir Anthony Denny.)*
==79==Well, sir, what follows?

**DEN.**
==80==Sir, I have brought my lord the Archbishop,
==81==As you commanded me.

**KING.**
==81==              Ha? Canterbury?

**DEN.**
==82==Ay, my good lord.

**KING.**
==82==           ’Tis true; where is he, Denny?

**DEN.**
==83==He attends your Highness’ pleasure.

**KING.**
==83==                  Bring him to us.

*Exit Denny.*

**LOV.**
*(Aside.)*
==84==This is about that which the Bishop spake.
==85==I am happily come hither.

*Enter Cranmer and Denny.*

**KING.**
==86==Avoid the gallery.
*(Lovell seems to stay.)*
==87==Ha? I have said. Be gone.
==88==What?

*Exeunt Lovell and Denny.*

**CRAN.**
*(Aside.)*
==88==    I am fearful; wherefore frowns he thus?
==89==’Tis his aspect of terror. All’s not well.

**KING.**
==90==How now, my lord? You do desire to know
==91==Wherefore I sent for you.

**CRAN.**
*(Kneeling.)*
==91==              It is my duty
==92==T’ attend your Highness’ pleasure.

**KING.**
==92==                  Pray you arise,
==93==My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
==94==Come, you and I must walk a turn together;
==95==I have news to tell you. Come, come, give me your hand.
==96==Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,
==97==And am right sorry to repeat what follows.
==98==I have, and most unwillingly, of late
==99==Heard many grievous—I do say, my lord,
==100==Grievous—complaints of you; which, being consider’d,
==101==Have mov’d us and our Council, that you shall
==102==This morning come before us, where I know
==103==You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,
==104==But that till further trial, in those charges
==105==Which will require your answer, you must take
==106==Your patience to you, and be well contented
==107==To make your house our Tow’r. You, a brother of us
==108==It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness
==109==Would come against you.

**CRAN.**
*(Kneeling.)*
==109==              I humbly thank your Highness,
==110==And am right glad to catch this good occasion
==111==Most throughly to be winnowed, where my chaff
==112==And corn shall fly asunder; for I know
==113==There’s none stands under more calumnious tongues
==114==Than I myself, poor man.

**KING.**
==114==           Stand up, good Canterbury!
==115==Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
==116==In us, thy friend. Give me thy hand, stand up;
==117==Prithee let’s walk. Now, by my holidame,
==118==What manner of man are you? My lord, I look’d
==119==You would have given me your petition, that
==120==I should have ta’en some pains to bring together
==121==Yourself and your accusers, and to have heard you
==122==Without indurance further.

**CRAN.**
==122==                Most dread liege,
==123==The good I stand on is my truth and honesty.
==124==If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,
==125==Will triumph o’er my person, which I weigh not,
==126==Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing
==127==What can be said against me.

**KING.**
==127==                  Know you not
==128==How your state stands i’ th’ world, with the whole world?
==129==Your enemies are many, and not small; their practices
==130==Must bear the same proportion, and not ever
==131==The justice and the truth o’ th’ question carries
==132==The due o’ th’ verdict with it. At what ease
==133==Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
==134==To swear against you? Such things have been done.
==135==You are potently oppos’d, and with a malice
==136==Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
==137==I mean in perjur’d witness, than your Master,
==138==Whose minister you are, whiles here he liv’d
==139==Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to!
==140==You take a precipit for no leap of danger,
==141==And woo your own destruction.

**CRAN.**
==141==                  God and your Majesty
==142==Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
==143==The trap is laid for me!

**KING.**
==143==              Be of good cheer,
==144==They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
==145==Keep comfort to you, and this morning see
==146==You do appear before them. If they shall chance,
==147==In charging you with matters, to commit you,
==148==The best persuasions to the contrary
==149==Fail not to use, and with what vehemency
==150==Th’ occasion shall instruct you. If entreaties
==151==Will render you no remedy, this ring
==152==Deliver them, and your appeal to us
==153==There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!
==154==He’s honest, on mine honor. God’s blest Mother!
==155==I swear he is true-hearted, and a soul
==156==None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,
==157==And do as I have bid you.
*(Exit Cranmer.)*
==157==              He has strangled
==158==His language in his tears.

*Enter Old Lady.*

**GENT.**
*(Within.)*
==159==Come back! What mean you?

**OLD L.**
==160==I’ll not come back, the tidings that I bring
==161==Will make my boldness manners. Now good angels
==162==Fly o’er thy royal head, and shade thy person
==163==Under their blessed wings!

**KING.**
==163==              Now by thy looks
==164==I guess thy message. Is the Queen deliver’d?
==165==Say ay, and of a boy.

**OLD L.**
==165==           Ay, ay, my liege,
==166==And of a lovely boy. The God of heaven
==167==Both now and ever bless her! ’Tis a girl
==168==Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
==169==Desires your visitation, and to be
==170==Acquainted with this stranger. ’Tis as like you
==171==As cherry is to cherry.

**KING.**
==171==              Lovell!

*Enter Lovell.*

**LOV.**
==171==                  Sir?

**KING.**
==172==Give her an hundred marks. I’ll to the Queen.

*Exit King.*

**OLD L.**
==173==An hundred marks? By this light, I’ll ha’ more.
==174==An ordinary groom is for such payment.
==175==I will have more or scold it out of him.
==176==Said I for this, the girl was like to him?
==177==I’ll have more, or else unsay’t; and now,
==178==While ’tis hot, I’ll put it to the issue.

*Exit Lady with Lovell.*
