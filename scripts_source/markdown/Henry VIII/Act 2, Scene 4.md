## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*A hall in Black-Friars.*

*Trumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter two Vergers, with short silver wands; next them, two Scribes, in the habit of doctors; after them, the Archbishop of Canterbury alone; after him, the Bishops of Lincoln, Ely, Rochester, and Saint Asaph; next them, with some small distance, follows a Gentleman bearing the purse, with the great seal, and a cardinal’s hat; then two Priests bearing each a silver cross; then a Gentleman Usher bare-headed, accompanied with a Sergeant-at Arms bearing a silver mace; then two Gentlemen bearing two great silver pillars; after them, side by side, the two Cardinals; two Noble-Men with the sword and mace. The King takes place under the cloth of state; the two Cardinals sit under him as judges. The Queen takes place some distance from the King. The Bishops place themselves on each side the court, in manner of a consistory; below them, the Scribes. The Lords sit next the Bishops. The rest of the Attendants stand in convenient order about the stage.*

**WOL.**
==1==Whilst our commission from Rome is read,
==2==Let silence be commanded.

**KING.**
==2==              What’s the need?
==3==It hath already publicly been read,
==4==And on all sides th’ authority allow’d;
==5==You may then spare that time.

**WOL.**
==5==                Be’t so; proceed.

**1. SCRIBE.**
==6==Say, Henry King of England, come into the court.

**CRIER.**
==7==Henry King of England, etc.

**KING.**
==8==Here.

**2. SCRIBE.**
==9==Say, Katherine Queen of England, come into the court.

**CRIER.**
==10==Katherine Queen of England, etc.

*The Queen makes no answer, rises out of her chair, goes about the court, comes to the King, and kneels at his feet; then speaks.*

**Q. KATH.**
==11==Sir, I desire you do me right and justice,
==12==And to bestow your pity on me; for
==13==I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,
==14==Born out of your dominions; having here
==15==No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance
==16==Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir!
==17==In what have I offended you? What cause
==18==Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,
==19==That thus you should proceed to put me off,
==20==And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
==21==I have been to you a true and humble wife,
==22==At all times to your will conformable;
==23==Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
==24==Yea, subject to your countenance—glad, or sorry,
==25==As I saw it inclin’d. When was the hour
==26==I ever contradicted your desire?
==27==Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends
==28==Have I not strove to love, although I knew
==29==He were mine enemy? What friend of mine
==30==That had to him deriv’d your anger did I
==31==Continue in my liking? Nay, gave notice
==32==He was from thence discharg’d? Sir, call to mind
==33==That I have been your wife in this obedience
==34==Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
==35==With many children by you. If, in the course
==36==And process of this time, you can report,
==37==And prove it too, against mine honor aught⁠—
==38==My bond to wedlock or my love and duty,
==39==Against your sacred person—in God’s name
==40==Turn me away; and let the foul’st contempt
==41==Shut door upon me, and so give me up
==42==To the sharp’st kind of justice. Please you, sir,
==43==The King your father was reputed for
==44==A prince most prudent, of an excellent
==45==And unmatch’d wit and judgment; Ferdinand,
==46==My father, King of Spain, was reckon’d one
==47==The wisest prince that there had reign’d by many
==48==A year before. It is not to be question’d
==49==That they had gather’d a wise council to them
==50==Of every realm, that did debate this business,
==51==Who deem’d our marriage lawful; wherefore I humbly
==52==Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may
==53==Be by my friends in Spain advis’d, whose counsel
==54==I will implore. If not, i’ th’ name of God,
==55==Your pleasure be fulfill’d!

**WOL.**
==55==              You have here, lady
==56==(And of your choice), these reverend fathers, men
==57==Of singular integrity and learning,
==58==Yea, the elect o’ th’ land, who are assembled
==59==To plead your cause. It shall be therefore bootless
==60==That longer you desire the court, as well
==61==For your own quiet, as to rectify
==62==What is unsettled in the King.

**CAM.**
==62==                His Grace
==63==Hath spoken well and justly; therefore, madam,
==64==It’s fit this royal session do proceed,
==65==And that, without delay, their arguments
==66==Be now produc’d and heard.

**Q. KATH.**
==66==              Lord Cardinal,
==67==To you I speak.

**WOL.**
==67==        Your pleasure, madam?

**Q. KATH.**
==67==                     Sir,
==68==I am about to weep; but thinking that
==69==We are a queen (or long have dream’d so), certain
==70==The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
==71==I’ll turn to sparks of fire.

**WOL.**
==71==              Be patient yet.

**Q. KATH.**
==72==I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
==73==Or God will punish me. I do believe
==74==(Induc’d by potent circumstances) that
==75==You are mine enemy, and make my challenge
==76==You shall not be my judge; for it is you
==77==Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me⁠—
==78==Which God’s dew quench! Therefore I say again,
==79==I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul
==80==Refuse you for my judge, whom, yet once more,
==81==I hold my most malicious foe, and think not
==82==At all a friend to truth.

**WOL.**
==82==              I do profess
==83==You speak not like yourself, who ever yet
==84==Have stood to charity, and display’d th’ effects
==85==Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom
==86==O’ertopping woman’s pow’r. Madam, you do me wrong,
==87==I have no spleen against you, nor injustice
==88==For you or any. How far I have proceeded,
==89==Or how far further shall, is warranted
==90==By a commission from the consistory,
==91==Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me
==92==That I have blown this coal. I do deny it.
==93==The King is present: if it be known to him
==94==That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
==95==And worthily, my falsehood! Yea, as much
==96==As you have done my truth. If he know
==97==That I am free of your report, he knows
==98==I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
==99==It lies to cure me, and the cure is to
==100==Remove these thoughts from you; the which before
==101==His Highness shall speak in, I do beseech
==102==You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking
==103==And to say so no more.

**Q. KATH.**
==103==              My lord, my lord,
==104==I am a simple woman, much too weak
==105==T’ oppose your cunning. Y’ are meek and humble-mouth’d,
==106==You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
==107==With meekness and humility; but your heart
==108==Is cramm’d with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
==109==You have, by fortune and his Highness’ favors,
==110==Gone slightly o’er low steps and now are mounted
==111==Where pow’rs are your retainers, and your words
==112==(Domestics to you) serve your will as’t please
==113==Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,
==114==You tender more your person’s honor than
==115==Your high profession spiritual; that again
==116==I do refuse you for my judge, and here,
==117==Before you all, appeal unto the Pope,
==118==To bring my whole cause ’fore his Holiness,
==119==And to be judg’d by him.

*She curtsies to the King and offers to depart.*

**CAM.**
==119==              The Queen is obstinate,
==120==Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and
==121==Disdainful to be tried by’t: ’tis not well.
==122==She’s going away.

**KING.**
==123==Call her again.

**CRIER.**
==124==Katherine Queen of England, come into the court.

**KING.**
==125==Madam, you are call’d back.

**Q. KATH.**
==126==What need you note it? Pray you keep your way;
==127==When you are call’d, return. Now the Lord help!
==128==They vex me past my patience. Pray you pass on.
==129==I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
==130==Upon this business my appearance make
==131==In any of their courts.

*Exeunt Queen and her Attendants.*

**KING.**
==131==              Go thy ways, Kate.
==132==That man i’ th’ world who shall report he has
==133==A better wife, let him in nought be trusted
==134==For speaking false in that. Thou art alone
==135==(If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,
==136==Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,
==137==Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
==138==Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out) 
==139==The queen of earthly queens. She’s noble born;
==140==And like her true nobility she has
==141==Carried herself towards me.

**WOL.**
==141==                Most gracious sir,
==142==In humblest manner I require your Highness
==143==That it shall please you to declare, in hearing
==144==Of all these ears (for, where I am robb’d and bound,
==145==There must I be unloos’d, although not there
==146==At once and fully satisfied), whether ever I
==147==Did broach this business to your Highness, or
==148==Laid any scruple in your way which might
==149==Induce you to the question on’t? Or ever
==150==Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
==151==A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
==152==Be to the prejudice of her present state,
==153==Or touch of her good person?

**KING.**
==153==                My Lord Cardinal,
==154==I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honor,
==155==I free you from’t. You are not to be taught
==156==That you have many enemies, that know not
==157==Why they are so, but, like to village curs,
==158==Bark when their fellows do: by some of these
==159==The Queen is put in anger. Y’ are excus’d;
==160==But will you be more justified? You ever
==161==Have wish’d the sleeping of this business, never desir’d
==162==It to be stirr’d; but oft have hind’red, oft,
==163==The passages made toward it. On my honor,
==164==I speak my good Lord Card’nal to this point,
==165==And thus far clear him. Now, what mov’d me to’t,
==166==I will be bold with time and your attention:
==167==Then mark th’ inducement. Thus it came; give heed to’t:
==168==My conscience first receiv’d a tenderness,
==169==Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter’d
==170==By th’ Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador,
==171==Who had been hither sent on the debating
==172==A marriage ’twixt the Duke of Orléans and
==173==Our daughter Mary. I’ th’ progress of this business,
==174==Ere a determinate resolution, he
==175==(I mean the Bishop) did require a respite,
==176==Wherein he might the King his lord advertise
==177==Whether our daughter were legitimate,
==178==Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
==179==Sometimes our brother’s wife. This respite shook
==180==The bosom of my conscience, enter’d me,
==181==Yea, with a spitting power, and made to tremble
==182==The region of my breast, which forc’d such way,
==183==That many maz’d considerings did throng
==184==And press’d in with this caution. First, methought
==185==I stood not in the smile of heaven, who had
==186==Commanded nature, that my lady’s womb,
==187==If it conceiv’d a male-child by me, should
==188==Do no more offices of life to’t than
==189==The grave does to th’ dead; for her male issue
==190==Or died where they were made, or shortly after
==191==This world had air’d them. Hence I took a thought
==192==This was a judgment on me, that my kingdom
==193==(Well worthy the best heir o’ th’ world) should not
==194==Be gladded in’t by me. Then follows, that
==195==I weigh’d the danger which my realms stood in
==196==By this my issue’s fail, and that gave to me
==197==Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
==198==The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
==199==Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
==200==Now present here together: that’s to say,
==201==I meant to rectify my conscience—which
==202==I then did feel full sick, and yet not well⁠—
==203==By all the reverend fathers of the land
==204==And doctors learn’d. First I began in private
==205==With you, my Lord of Lincoln. You remember
==206==How under my oppression I did reek
==207==When I first mov’d you.

**LIN.**
==207==              Very well, my liege.

**KING.**
==208==I have spoke long, be pleas’d yourself to say
==209==How far you satisfied me.

**LIN.**
==209==              So please your Highness,
==210==The question did at first so stagger me,
==211==Bearing a state of mighty moment in’t
==212==And consequence of dread, that I committed
==213==The daring’st counsel which I had to doubt,
==214==And did entreat your Highness to this course
==215==Which you are running here.

**KING.**
==215==                I then mov’d you,
==216==My Lord of Canterbury, and got your leave
==217==To make this present summons. Unsolicited
==218==I left no reverend person in this court;
==219==But by particular consent proceeded
==220==Under your hands and seals. Therefore go on,
==221==For no dislike i’ th’ world against the person
==222==Of the good Queen, but the sharp thorny points
==223==Of my alleged reasons, drives this forward.
==224==Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
==225==And kingly dignity, we are contented
==226==To wear our mortal state to come with her,
==227==Katherine our queen, before the primest creature
==228==That’s paragon’d o’ th’ world.

**CAM.**
==228==                So please your Highness,
==229==The Queen being absent, ’tis a needful fitness
==230==That we adjourn this court till further day.
==231==Mean while must be an earnest motion
==232==Made to the Queen to call back her appeal
==233==She intends unto his Holiness.

**KING.**
*(Aside.)*
==233==                I may perceive
==234==These Cardinals trifle with me; I abhor
==235==This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
==236==My learn’d and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,
==237==Prithee return; with thy approach, I know,
==238==My comfort comes along.—Break up the court!
==239==I say, set on.

*Exeunt in manner as they enter’d.*
