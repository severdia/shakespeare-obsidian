## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*London. An ante-chamber in the palace.*

*Enter Lord Chamberlain and Lord Sands.*

**CHAM.**
==1==Is’t possible the spells of France should juggle
==2==Men into such strange mysteries?

**SAN.**
==2==                  New customs,
==3==Though they be never so ridiculous
==4==(Nay, let ’em be unmanly), yet are follow’d.

**CHAM.**
==5==As far as I see, all the good our English
==6==Have got by the late voyage is but merely
==7==A fit or two o’ th’ face—but they are shrewd ones,
==8==For when they hold ’em, you would swear directly
==9==Their very noses had been councillors
==10==To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.

**SAN.**
==11==They have all new legs, and lame ones. One would take it,
==12==That never see ’em pace before, the spavin
==13==And springhalt reign’d among ’em.

**CHAM.**
==13==                  Death, my lord,
==14==Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to’t,
==15==That sure th’ have worn out Christendom.
*(Enter Sir Thomas Lovell.)*
==15==                     How now?
==16==What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?

**LOV.**
==16==                  Faith, my lord,
==17==I hear of none but the new proclamation
==18==That’s clapp’d upon the court gate.

**CHAM.**
==18==                  What is’t for?

**LOV.**
==19==The reformation of our travel’d gallants,
==20==That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.

**CHAM.**
==21==I’m glad ’tis there. Now I would pray our monsieurs
==22==To think an English courtier may be wise
==23==And never see the Louvre.

**LOV.**
==23==              They must either
==24==(For so run the conditions) leave those remnants
==25==Of fool and feather that they got in France,
==26==With all their honorable points of ignorance
==27==Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,
==28==Abusing better men than they can be
==29==Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean
==30==The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings,
==31==Short blist’red breeches, and those types of travel,
==32==And understand again like honest men,
==33==Or pack to their old playfellows. There, I take it,
==34==They may, *cum privilegio*, *“oui”* away
==35==The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh’d at.

**SAN.**
==36==’Tis time to give ’em physic, their diseases
==37==Are grown so catching.

**CHAM.**
==37==              What a loss our ladies
==38==Will have of these trim vanities!

**LOV.**
==38==                  Ay, marry,
==39==There will be woe indeed, lords; the sly whoresons
==40==Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies.
==41==A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.

**SAN.**
==42==The devil fiddle ’em! I am glad they are going,
==43==For sure there’s no converting of ’em. Now
==44==An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
==45==A long time out of play, may bring his plain-song
==46==And have an hour of hearing, and, by’r lady,
==47==Held current music too.

**CHAM.**
==47==              Well said, Lord Sands,
==48==Your colt’s tooth is not cast yet?

**SAN.**
==48==                  No, my lord,
==49==Nor shall not while I have a stump.

**CHAM.**
==49==                  Sir Thomas,
==50==Whither were you a-going?

**LOV.**
==50==              To the Cardinal’s.
==51==Your lordship is a guest too.

**CHAM.**
==51==                O, ’tis true;
==52==This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
==53==To many lords and ladies; there will be
==54==The beauty of this kingdom, I’ll assure you.

**LOV.**
==55==That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,
==56==A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
==57==His dews fall every where.

**CHAM.**
==57==              No doubt he’s noble;
==58==He had a black mouth that said other of him.

**SAN.**
==59==He may, my lord, h’as wherewithal: in him
==60==Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine.
==61==Men of his way should be most liberal,
==62==They are set here for examples.

**CHAM.**
==62==                  True, they are so;
==63==But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;
==64==Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
==65==We shall be late else, which I would not be,
==66==For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guilford
==67==This night to be comptrollers.

**SAN.**
==67==                I am your lordship’s.

*Exeunt.*
