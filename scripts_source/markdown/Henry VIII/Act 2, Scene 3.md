## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*London. An ante-chamber in the Queen’s apartment.*

*Enter Anne Boleyn and an Old Lady.*

**ANNE.**
==1==Not for that neither; here’s the pang that pinches:
==2==His Highness having liv’d so long with her, and she
==3==So good a lady that no tongue could ever
==4==Pronounce dishonor of her—by my life,
==5==She never knew harm-doing—O, now after
==6==So many courses of the sun enthroned,
==7==Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which
==8==To leave a thousandfold more bitter than
==9==’Tis sweet at first t’ acquire—after this process,
==10==To give her the avaunt, it is a pity
==11==Would move a monster.

**OLD L.**
==11==           Hearts of most hard temper
==12==Melt and lament for her.

**ANNE.**
==12==              O, God’s will, much better
==13==She ne’er had known pomp! Though’t be temporal,
==14==Yet if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
==15==It from the bearer, ’tis a sufferance panging
==16==As soul and body’s severing.

**OLD L.**
==16==                Alas, poor lady!
==17==She’s a stranger now again.

**ANNE.**
==17==              So much the more
==18==Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
==19==I swear, ’tis better to be lowly born,
==20==And range with humble livers in content,
==21==Than to be perk’d up in a glist’ring grief
==22==And wear a golden sorrow.

**OLD L.**
==22==              Our content
==23==Is our best having.

**ANNE.**
==23==           By my troth and maidenhead,
==24==I would not be a queen.

**OLD L.**
==24==              Beshrew me, I would,
==25==And venture maidenhead for’t, and so would you
==26==For all this spice of your hypocrisy.
==27==You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,
==28==Have, too, a woman’s heart, which ever yet
==29==Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;
==30==Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts
==31==(Saving your mincing) the capacity
==32==Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive
==33==If you might please to stretch it.

**ANNE.**
==33==                  Nay, good troth.

**OLD L.**
==34==Yes, troth, and troth. You would not be a queen?

**ANNE.**
==35==No, not for all the riches under heaven.

**OLD L.**
==36==’Tis strange. A threepence bow’d would hire me,
==37==Old as I am, to queen it. But I pray you,
==38==What think you of a duchess? Have you limbs
==39==To bear that load of title?

**ANNE.**
==39==              No, in truth.

**OLD L.**
==40==Then you are weakly made; pluck off a little,
==41==I would not be a young count in your way
==42==For more than blushing comes to. If your back
==43==Cannot vouchsafe this burden, ’tis too weak
==44==Ever to get a boy.

**ANNE.**
==44==           How you do talk!
==45==I swear again, I would not be a queen
==46==For all the world.

**OLD L.**
==46==           In faith, for little England
==47==You’ld venture an emballing. I myself
==48==Would for Carnarvonshire, although there ’long’d
==49==No more to th’ crown but that. Lo, who comes here?

*Enter Lord Chamberlain.*

**CHAM.**
==50==Good morrow, ladies. What were’t worth to know
==51==The secret of your conference?

**ANNE.**
==51==                My good lord,
==52==Not your demand; it values not your asking.
==53==Our mistress’ sorrows we were pitying.

**CHAM.**
==54==It was a gentle business, and becoming
==55==The action of good women. There is hope
==56==All will be well.

**ANNE.**
==56==        Now I pray God, amen!

**CHAM.**
==57==You bear a gentle mind, and heav’nly blessings
==58==Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,
==59==Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note’s
==60==Ta’en of your many virtues, the King’s Majesty
==61==Commends his good opinion of you to you, and
==62==Does purpose honor to you no less flowing
==63==Than Marchioness of Pembroke; to which title
==64==A thousand pound a year, annual support,
==65==Out of his grace he adds.

**ANNE.**
==65==              I do not know
==66==What kind of my obedience I should tender.
==67==More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
==68==Are not words duly hallowed, nor my wishes
==69==More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes
==70==Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,
==71==Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,
==72==As from a blushing handmaid, to his Highness;
==73==Whose health and royalty I pray for.

**CHAM.**
==73==                     Lady,
==74==I shall not fail t’ approve the fair conceit
==75==The King hath of you.
*(Aside.)*
==75==           I have perus’d her well;
==76==Beauty and honor in her are so mingled
==77==That they have caught the King; and who knows yet
==78==But from this lady may proceed a gem
==79==To lighten all this isle?—I’ll to the King,
==80==And say I spoke with you.

**ANNE.**
==80==              My honor’d lord.

*Exit Lord Chamberlain.*

**OLD L.**
==81==Why, this it is! See, see,
==82==I have been begging sixteen years in court
==83==(Am yet a courtier beggarly) nor could
==84==Come pat betwixt too early and too late
==85==For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!
==86==A very fresh fish here—fie, fie, fie upon
==87==This compell’d fortune!—have your mouth fill’d up
==88==Before you open it.

**ANNE.**
==88==           This is strange to me.

**OLD L.**
==89==How tastes it? Is it bitter? Forty pence, no.
==90==There was a lady once (’tis an old story) 
==91==That would not be a queen, that would she not,
==92==For all the mud in Egypt. Have you heard it?

**ANNE.**
==93==Come, you are pleasant.

**OLD L.**
==93==              With your theme, I could
==94==O’ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke?
==95==A thousand pounds a year for pure respect?
==96==No other obligation? By my life,
==97==That promises more thousands; honor’s train
==98==Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time
==99==I know your back will bear a duchess. Say,
==100==Are you not stronger than you were?

**ANNE.**
==100==                     Good lady,
==101==Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,
==102==And leave me out on’t. Would I had no being
==103==If this salute my blood a jot; it faints me
==104==To think what follows.
==105==The Queen is comfortless, and we forgetful
==106==In our long absence. Pray do not deliver
==107==What here y’ have heard to her.

**OLD L.**
==107==                What do you think me?

*Exeunt.*
