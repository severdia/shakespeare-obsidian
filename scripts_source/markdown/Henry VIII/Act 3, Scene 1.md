## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*London. Queen Katherine’s apartment.*

*Enter Queen and her Women as at work.*

**Q. KATH.**
==1==Take thy lute, wench, my soul grows sad with troubles.
==2==Sing, and disperse ’em if thou canst. Leave working.

**GENTLEW.**
*(Song.)*
==3==*Orpheus with his lute made trees,*
==4==*And the mountain tops that freeze,*
==5==*Bow themselves when he did sing.*
==6==*To his music plants and flowers*
==7==*Ever sprung, as sun and showers*
==8==*There had made a lasting spring.*
==9==*Every thing that heard him play,*
==10==*Even the billows of the sea,*
==11==*Hung their heads, and then lay by.*
==12==*In sweet music is such art,*
==13==*Killing care and grief of heart*
==14==*Fall asleep, or hearing, die.*

*Enter Griffith.*

**Q. KATH.**
==15==How now?

**GRIF.**
==16==And’t please your Grace, the two great Cardinals
==17==Wait in the presence.

**Q. KATH.**
==18==Would they speak with me?

**GRIF.**
==19==They will’d me say so, madam.

**Q. KATH.**
==19==                Pray their Graces
==20==To come near.
*(Exit Griffith.)*
==20==        What can be their business
==21==With me, a poor weak woman, fall’n from favor?
==22==I do not like their coming. Now I think on’t,
==23==They should be good men, their affairs as righteous.
==24==But all hoods make not monks.

*Enter the two Cardinals, Wolsey and Campeius.*

**WOL.**
==24==                  Peace to your Highness!

**Q. KATH.**
==25==Your Graces find me here part of a huswife
==26==(I would be all) against the worst may happen.
==27==What are your pleasures with me, reverent lords?

**WOL.**
==28==May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw
==29==Into your private chamber, we shall give you
==30==The full cause of our coming.

**Q. KATH.**
==30==                Speak it here;
==31==There’s nothing I have done yet, o’ my conscience,
==32==Deserves a corner. Would all other women
==33==Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
==34==My lords, I care not (so much I am happy
==35==Above a number) if my actions
==36==Were tried by ev’ry tongue, ev’ry eye saw ’em,
==37==Envy and base opinion set against ’em,
==38==I know my life so even. If your business
==39==Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
==40==Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.

**WOL.**
==41==*Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenissima*⁠—

**Q. KATH.**
==42==O, good my lord, no Latin;
==43==I am not such a truant since my coming,
==44==As not to know the language I have liv’d in.
==45==A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
==46==Pray speak in English. Here are some will thank you,
==47==If you speak truth, for their poor mistress’ sake;
==48==Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,
==49==The willing’st sin I ever yet committed
==50==May be absolv’d in English.

**WOL.**
==50==                Noble lady,
==51==I am sorry my integrity should breed
==52==(And service to his Majesty and you) 
==53==So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
==54==We come not by the way of accusation
==55==To taint that honor every good tongue blesses,
==56==Nor to betray you any way to sorrow⁠—
==57==You have too much, good lady; but to know
==58==How you stand minded in the weighty difference
==59==Between the King and you, and to deliver
==60==(Like free and honest men) our just opinions
==61==And comforts to your cause.

**CAM.**
==61==                Most honor’d madam,
==62==My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,
==63==Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace,
==64==Forgetting (like a good man) your late censure
==65==Both of his truth and him (which was too far),
==66==Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
==67==His service and his counsel.

**Q. KATH.**
*(Aside.)*
==67==                To betray me.⁠—
==68==My lords, I thank you both for your good wills,
==69==Ye speak like honest men (pray God ye prove so!),
==70==But how to make ye suddenly an answer
==71==In such a point of weight, so near mine honor
==72==(More near my life, I fear), with my weak wit,
==73==And to such men of gravity and learning,
==74==In truth I know not. I was set at work
==75==Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking
==76==Either for such men or such business.
==77==For her sake that I have been—for I feel
==78==The last fit of my greatness—good your Graces,
==79==Let me have time and counsel for my cause.
==80==Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!

**WOL.**
==81==Madam, you wrong the King’s love with these fears,
==82==Your hopes and friends are infinite.

**Q. KATH.**
==82==                  In England
==83==But little for my profit; can you think, lords,
==84==That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
==85==Or be a known friend, ’gainst his Highness’ pleasure
==86==(Though he be grown so desperate to be honest),
==87==And live a subject? Nay forsooth, my friends,
==88==They that must weigh out my afflictions,
==89==They that my trust must grow to, live not here.
==90==They are (as all my other comforts) far hence
==91==In mine own country, lords.

**CAM.**
==91==              I would your Grace
==92==Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.

**Q. KATH.**
==92==                     How, sir?

**CAM.**
==93==Put your main cause into the King’s protection,
==94==He’s loving and most gracious. ’Twill be much
==95==Both for your honor better and your cause;
==96==For if the trial of the law o’ertake ye,
==97==You’ll part away disgrac’d.

**WOL.**
==97==              He tells you rightly.

**Q. KATH.**
==98==Ye tell me what ye wish for both—my ruin.
==99==Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon ye!
==100==Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
==101==That no king can corrupt.

**CAM.**
==101==              Your rage mistakes us.

**Q. KATH.**
==102==The more shame for ye! Holy men I thought ye,
==103==Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
==104==But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.
==105==Mend ’em for shame, my lords! Is this your comfort?
==106==The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
==107==A woman lost among ye, laugh’d at, scorn’d?
==108==I will not wish ye half my miseries,
==109==I have more charity. But say I warn’d ye;
==110==Take heed, for heaven’s sake take heed, lest at once
==111==The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye.

**WOL.**
==112==Madam, this is a mere distraction,
==113==You turn the good we offer into envy.

**Q. KATH.**
==114==Ye turn me into nothing! Woe upon ye
==115==And all such false professors! Would you have me
==116==(If you have any justice, any pity,
==117==If ye be any thing but churchmen’s habits) 
==118==Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
==119==Alas, h’as banish’d me his bed already,
==120==His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,
==121==And all the fellowship I hold now with him
==122==Is only my obedience. What can happen
==123==To me above this wretchedness? All your studies
==124==Make me a curse like this!

**CAM.**
==124==              Your fears are worse.

**Q. KATH.**
==125==Have I liv’d thus long (let me speak myself,
==126==Since virtue finds no friends) a wife, a true one?
==127==A woman (I dare say without vainglory) 
==128==Never yet branded with suspicion?
==129==Have I with all my full affections
==130==Still met the King? Lov’d him next heav’n? Obey’d him?
==131==Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
==132==Almost forgot my pray’rs to content him?
==133==And am I thus rewarded? ’Tis not well, lords.
==134==Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
==135==One that ne’er dream’d a joy beyond his pleasure;
==136==And to that woman (when she has done most) 
==137==Yet will I add an honor—a great patience.

**WOL.**
==138==Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.

**Q. KATH.**
==139==My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty
==140==To give up willingly that noble title
==141==Your master wed me to. Nothing but death
==142==Shall e’er divorce my dignities.

**WOL.**
==142==                  Pray hear me.

**Q. KATH.**
==143==Would I had never trod this English earth,
==144==Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
==145==Ye have angels’ faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
==146==What will become of me now, wretched lady?
==147==I am the most unhappy woman living.
==148==Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes?
==149==Shipwrack’d upon a kingdom, where no pity,
==150==No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me,
==151==Almost no grave allow’d me. Like the lily,
==152==That once was mistress of the field, and flourish’d,
==153==I’ll hang my head and perish.

**WOL.**
==153==                If your Grace
==154==Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
==155==You’ld feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,
==156==Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places,
==157==The way of our profession is against it;
==158==We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow ’em.
==159==For goodness sake, consider what you do,
==160==How you may hurt yourself—ay, utterly
==161==Grow from the King’s acquaintance, by this carriage.
==162==The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
==163==So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
==164==They swell and grow, as terrible as storms.
==165==I know you have a gentle, noble temper,
==166==A soul as even as a calm; pray think us
==167==Those we profess, peacemakers, friends, and servants.

**CAM.**
==168==Madam, you’ll find it so. You wrong your virtues
==169==With these weak women’s fears. A noble spirit
==170==As yours was put into you, ever casts
==171==Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The King loves you,
==172==Beware you lose it not. For us (if you please
==173==To trust us in your business), we are ready
==174==To use our utmost studies in your service.

**Q. KATH.**
==175==Do what ye will, my lords; and pray forgive me;
==176==If I have us’d myself unmannerly,
==177==You know I am a woman, lacking wit
==178==To make a seemly answer to such persons.
==179==Pray do my service to his Majesty;
==180==He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
==181==While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,
==182==Bestow your counsels on me. She now begs
==183==That little thought, when she set footing here,
==184==She should have bought her dignities so dear.

*Exeunt.*
