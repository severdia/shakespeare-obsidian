## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*London. Queen Katherine’s apartment.*

*Enter Queen and her Women as at work.*

**Q. KATH.**
==1==Take thy lute, wench, my soul grows sad with troubles.
==2==Sing, and disperse ’em if thou canst. Leave working.

**GENTLEW.**
*(Song.)*
==3==    *Orpheus with his lute made trees,*
==4==    *And the mountain tops that freeze,*
==5== *Bow themselves when he did sing.*
==6==    *To his music plants and flowers*
==7==    *Ever sprung, as sun and showers*
==8== *There had made a lasting spring.*
==9==    *Every thing that heard him play,*
==10==    *Even the billows of the sea,*
==11== *Hung their heads, and then lay by.*
==12==    *In sweet music is such art,*
==13==    *Killing care and grief of heart*
==14== *Fall asleep, or hearing, die.*

*Enter Griffith.*

**Q. KATH.**
==15==How now?

**GRIF.**
==16==And’t please your Grace, the two great Cardinals
==17==Wait in the presence.

**Q. KATH.**
==17==           Would they speak with me?

**GRIF.**
==18==They will’d me say so, madam.

**Q. KATH.**
==18==                Pray their Graces
==19==To come near.
*(Exit Griffith.)*
==19==        What can be their business
==20==With me, a poor weak woman, fall’n from favor?
==21==I do not like their coming. Now I think on’t,
==22==They should be good men, their affairs as righteous.
==23==But all hoods make not monks.

*Enter the two Cardinals, Wolsey and Campeius.*

**WOL.**
==23==                  Peace to your Highness!

**Q. KATH.**
==24==Your Graces find me here part of a huswife
==25==(I would be all) against the worst may happen.
==26==What are your pleasures with me, reverent lords?

**WOL.**
==27==May it please you, noble madam, to withdraw
==28==Into your private chamber, we shall give you
==29==The full cause of our coming.

**Q. KATH.**
==29==                Speak it here;
==30==There’s nothing I have done yet, o’ my conscience,
==31==Deserves a corner. Would all other women
==32==Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
==33==My lords, I care not (so much I am happy
==34==Above a number) if my actions
==35==Were tried by ev’ry tongue, ev’ry eye saw ’em,
==36==Envy and base opinion set against ’em,
==37==I know my life so even. If your business
==38==Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
==39==Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.

**WOL.**
==40==*Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina serenissima*⁠—

**Q. KATH.**
==41==O, good my lord, no Latin;
==42==I am not such a truant since my coming,
==43==As not to know the language I have liv’d in.
==44==A strange tongue makes my cause more strange, suspicious;
==45==Pray speak in English. Here are some will thank you,
==46==If you speak truth, for their poor mistress’ sake;
==47==Believe me, she has had much wrong. Lord Cardinal,
==48==The willing’st sin I ever yet committed
==49==May be absolv’d in English.

**WOL.**
==49==                Noble lady,
==50==I am sorry my integrity should breed
==51==(And service to his Majesty and you) 
==52==So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
==53==We come not by the way of accusation
==54==To taint that honor every good tongue blesses,
==55==Nor to betray you any way to sorrow⁠—
==56==You have too much, good lady; but to know
==57==How you stand minded in the weighty difference
==58==Between the King and you, and to deliver
==59==(Like free and honest men) our just opinions
==60==And comforts to your cause.

**CAM.**
==60==                Most honor’d madam,
==61==My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,
==62==Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace,
==63==Forgetting (like a good man) your late censure
==64==Both of his truth and him (which was too far),
==65==Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
==66==His service and his counsel.

**Q. KATH.**
*(Aside.)*
==66==                To betray me.⁠—
==67==My lords, I thank you both for your good wills,
==68==Ye speak like honest men (pray God ye prove so!),
==69==But how to make ye suddenly an answer
==70==In such a point of weight, so near mine honor
==71==(More near my life, I fear), with my weak wit,
==72==And to such men of gravity and learning,
==73==In truth I know not. I was set at work
==74==Among my maids, full little, God knows, looking
==75==Either for such men or such business.
==76==For her sake that I have been—for I feel
==77==The last fit of my greatness—good your Graces,
==78==Let me have time and counsel for my cause.
==79==Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!

**WOL.**
==80==Madam, you wrong the King’s love with these fears,
==81==Your hopes and friends are infinite.

**Q. KATH.**
==81==                  In England
==82==But little for my profit; can you think, lords,
==83==That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
==84==Or be a known friend, ’gainst his Highness’ pleasure
==85==(Though he be grown so desperate to be honest),
==86==And live a subject? Nay forsooth, my friends,
==87==They that must weigh out my afflictions,
==88==They that my trust must grow to, live not here.
==89==They are (as all my other comforts) far hence
==90==In mine own country, lords.

**CAM.**
==90==              I would your Grace
==91==Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.

**Q. KATH.**
==91==                       How, sir?

**CAM.**
==92==Put your main cause into the King’s protection,
==93==He’s loving and most gracious. ’Twill be much
==94==Both for your honor better and your cause;
==95==For if the trial of the law o’ertake ye,
==96==You’ll part away disgrac’d.

**WOL.**
==96==              He tells you rightly.

**Q. KATH.**
==97==Ye tell me what ye wish for both—my ruin.
==98==Is this your Christian counsel? Out upon ye!
==99==Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
==100==That no king can corrupt.

**CAM.**
==100==              Your rage mistakes us.

**Q. KATH.**
==101==The more shame for ye! Holy men I thought ye,
==102==Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
==103==But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye.
==104==Mend ’em for shame, my lords! Is this your comfort?
==105==The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
==106==A woman lost among ye, laugh’d at, scorn’d?
==107==I will not wish ye half my miseries,
==108==I have more charity. But say I warn’d ye;
==109==Take heed, for heaven’s sake take heed, lest at once
==110==The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye.

**WOL.**
==111==Madam, this is a mere distraction,
==112==You turn the good we offer into envy.

**Q. KATH.**
==113==Ye turn me into nothing! Woe upon ye
==114==And all such false professors! Would you have me
==115==(If you have any justice, any pity,
==116==If ye be any thing but churchmen’s habits) 
==117==Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
==118==Alas, h’as banish’d me his bed already,
==119==His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,
==120==And all the fellowship I hold now with him
==121==Is only my obedience. What can happen
==122==To me above this wretchedness? All your studies
==123==Make me a curse like this!

**CAM.**
==123==              Your fears are worse.

**Q. KATH.**
==124==Have I liv’d thus long (let me speak myself,
==125==Since virtue finds no friends) a wife, a true one?
==126==A woman (I dare say without vainglory) 
==127==Never yet branded with suspicion?
==128==Have I with all my full affections
==129==Still met the King? Lov’d him next heav’n? Obey’d him?
==130==Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
==131==Almost forgot my pray’rs to content him?
==132==And am I thus rewarded? ’Tis not well, lords.
==133==Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
==134==One that ne’er dream’d a joy beyond his pleasure;
==135==And to that woman (when she has done most) 
==136==Yet will I add an honor—a great patience.

**WOL.**
==137==Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.

**Q. KATH.**
==138==My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty
==139==To give up willingly that noble title
==140==Your master wed me to. Nothing but death
==141==Shall e’er divorce my dignities.

**WOL.**
==141==                  Pray hear me.

**Q. KATH.**
==142==Would I had never trod this English earth,
==143==Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
==144==Ye have angels’ faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
==145==What will become of me now, wretched lady?
==146==I am the most unhappy woman living.
==147==Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes?
==148==Shipwreck’d upon a kingdom, where no pity,
==149==No friends, no hope, no kindred weep for me,
==150==Almost no grave allow’d me. Like the lily,
==151==That once was mistress of the field, and flourish’d,
==152==I’ll hang my head and perish.

**WOL.**
==152==                If your Grace
==153==Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
==154==You’ld feel more comfort. Why should we, good lady,
==155==Upon what cause, wrong you? Alas, our places,
==156==The way of our profession is against it;
==157==We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow ’em.
==158==For goodness sake, consider what you do,
==159==How you may hurt yourself—ay, utterly
==160==Grow from the King’s acquaintance, by this carriage.
==161==The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
==162==So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
==163==They swell and grow, as terrible as storms.
==164==I know you have a gentle, noble temper,
==165==A soul as even as a calm; pray think us
==166==Those we profess, peacemakers, friends, and servants.

**CAM.**
==167==Madam, you’ll find it so. You wrong your virtues
==168==With these weak women’s fears. A noble spirit
==169==As yours was put into you, ever casts
==170==Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The King loves you,
==171==Beware you lose it not. For us (if you please
==172==To trust us in your business), we are ready
==173==To use our utmost studies in your service.

**Q. KATH.**
==174==Do what ye will, my lords; and pray forgive me;
==175==If I have us’d myself unmannerly,
==176==You know I am a woman, lacking wit
==177==To make a seemly answer to such persons.
==178==Pray do my service to his Majesty;
==179==He has my heart yet and shall have my prayers
==180==While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,
==181==Bestow your counsels on me. She now begs
==182==That little thought, when she set footing here,
==183==She should have bought her dignities so dear.

*Exeunt.*
