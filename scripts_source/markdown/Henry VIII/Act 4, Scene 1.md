## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Westminster. A street.*

*Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another.*

**1. GENT.**
==1==Y’ are well met once again.

**2. GENT.**
==1==                So are you.

**1. GENT.**
==2==You come to take your stand here, and behold
==3==The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?

**2. GENT.**
==4==’Tis all my business. At our last encounter,
==5==The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.

**1. GENT.**
==6==’Tis very true; but that time offer’d sorrow,
==7==This, general joy.

**2. GENT.**
==7==           ’Tis well. The citizens
==8==I am sure have shown at full their royal minds⁠—
==9==As, let ’em have their rights, they are ever forward
==10==In celebration of this day with shows,
==11==Pageants, and sights of honor.

**1. GENT.**
==11==                Never greater,
==12==Nor, I’ll assure you, better taken, sir.

**2. GENT.**
==13==May I be bold to ask what that contains,
==14==That paper in your hand?

**1. GENT.**
==14==              Yes, ’tis the list
==15==Of those that claim their offices this day
==16==By custom of the coronation.
==17==The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
==18==To be High Steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,
==19==He to be Earl Marshal. You may read the rest.

**2. GENT.**
==20==I thank you, sir; had I not known those customs
==21==I should have been beholding to your paper.
==22==But I beseech you, what’s become of Katherine,
==23==The Princess Dowager? How goes her business?

**1. GENT.**
==24==That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
==25==Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
==26==Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
==27==Held a late court at Dunstable—six miles off
==28==From Ampthill, where the Princess lay—to which
==29==She was often cited by them, but appear’d not;
==30==And, to be short, for not appearance and
==31==The King’s late scruple, by the main assent
==32==Of all these learned men she was divorc’d,
==33==And the late marriage made of none effect;
==34==Since which she was remov’d to Kimmalton,
==35==Where she remains now sick.

**2. GENT.**
==35==                Alas, good lady!
*(Trumpets.)*
==36==The trumpets sound; stand close, the Queen is coming.

*Hoboys.*

*The Order of the Coronation*

*1. A lively flourish of trumpets.*

*2. Then, two JUDGES.*

*3. LORD CHANCELLOR, with purse and mace before him.*

*4. CHORISTERS, singing.*

*Music.*

*5. MAYOR OF LONDON, bearing the mace. Then GARTER, in his coat of arms, and on his head he wore a gilt copper crown.*

*6. MARQUESS DORSET, bearing a scepter of gold, on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With him, the EARL OF SURREY, bearing the rod of silver with the dove, crowned with an earl’s coronet. Collars of Esses.*

*7. DUKE OF SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet on his head, bearing a long white wand, as High Steward. With him, the DUKE OF NORFOLK, with the rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head. Collars of Esses.*

*8. A canopy borne by four of the CINQUE-PORTS; under it, the QUEEN in her robe, in her hair, richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each side her, the BISHOPS OF LONDON and WINCHESTER.*

*9. The old DUCHESS OF NORFOLK, in a coronal of gold, wrought with flowers, bearing the Queen’s train.*

*10. Certain LADIES or COUNTESSES, with plain circlets of gold without flowers.*

*Exeunt, first passing over the stage in order and state, and then a great flourish of trumpets.*

**2. GENT.**
==37==A royal train, believe me. These I know.
==38==Who’s that that bears the scepter?

**1. GENT.**
==38==                  Marquess Dorset,
==39==And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.

**2. GENT.**
==40==A bold brave gentleman. That should be
==41==The Duke of Suffolk.

**1. GENT.**
==41==           ’Tis the same: High Steward.

**2. GENT.**
==42==And that my Lord of Norfolk?

**1. GENT.**
==42==                Yes.

**2. GENT.**
==42==                  Heaven bless thee!
*(Looking on the Queen.)*
==43==Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look’d on.
==44==Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
==45==Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
==46==And more and richer, when he strains that lady.
==47==I cannot blame his conscience.

**1. GENT.**
==47==                They that bear
==48==The cloth of honor over her, are four barons
==49==Of the Cinque-Ports.

**2. GENT.**
==50==Those men are happy, and so are all are near her.
==51==I take it, she that carries up the train
==52==Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.

**1. GENT.**
==53==It is, and all the rest are countesses.

**2. GENT.**
==54==Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed.

**1. GENT.**
==55==And sometimes falling ones.

**2. GENT.**
==55==                No more of that.

*Exit the last of the procession; flourish of trumpets.*

*Enter a third Gentleman.*

**1. GENT.**
==56==God save you, sir! Where have you been broiling?

**3. GENT.**
==57==Among the crowd i’ th’ Abbey, where a finger
==58==Could not be wedg’d in more. I am stifled
==59==With the mere rankness of their joy.

**2. GENT.**
==59==                     You saw
==60==The ceremony?

**3. GENT.**
==60==        That I did.

**1. GENT.**
==60==              How was it?

**3. GENT.**
==61==Well worth the seeing.

**2. GENT.**
==61==           Good sir, speak it to us.

**3. GENT.**
==62==As well as I am able. The rich stream
==63==Of lords and ladies, having brought the Queen
==64==To a prepar’d place in the choir, fell off
==65==A distance from her; while her Grace sate down
==66==To rest a while, some half an hour or so,
==67==In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
==68==The beauty of her person to the people.
==69==Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
==70==That ever lay by man—which when the people
==71==Had the full view of, such a noise arose
==72==As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,
==73==As loud and to as many tunes. Hats, cloaks
==74==(Doublets, I think) flew up, and had their faces
==75==Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy
==76==I never saw before. Great-bellied women,
==77==That had not half a week to go, like rams
==78==In the old time of war, would shake the press
==79==And make ’em reel before ’em. No man living
==80==Could say, “This is my wife” there, all were woven
==81==So strangely in one piece.

**2. GENT.**
==81==              But what follow’d?

**3. GENT.**
==82==At length her Grace rose, and with modest paces
==83==Came to the altar, where she kneel’d, and saint-like
==84==Cast her fair eyes to heaven, and pray’d devoutly;
==85==Then rose again and bow’d her to the people;
==86==When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
==87==She had all the royal makings of a queen,
==88==As holy oil, Edward Confessor’s crown,
==89==The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems
==90==Laid nobly on her; which perform’d, the choir,
==91==With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
==92==Together sung *Te Deum*. So she parted,
==93==And with the same full state pac’d back again
==94==To York-place, where the feast is held.

**1. GENT.**
==94==                     Sir,
==95==You must no more call it York-place, that’s past;
==96==For since the Cardinal fell that title’s lost.
==97==’Tis now the King’s, and call’d Whitehall.

**3. GENT.**
==97==                     I know it;
==98==But ’tis so lately alter’d that the old name
==99==Is fresh about me.

**2. GENT.**
==99==           What two reverend bishops
==100==Were those that went on each side of the Queen?

**3. GENT.**
==101==Stokesly and Gardiner, the one of Winchester,
==102==Newly preferr’d from the King’s secretary,
==103==The other, London.

**2. GENT.**
==103==           He of Winchester
==104==Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop’s,
==105==The virtuous Cranmer.

**3. GENT.**
==105==              All the land knows that.
==106==However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,
==107==Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.

**2. GENT.**
==108==Who may that be, I pray you?

**3. GENT.**
==108==                Thomas Cromwell,
==109==A man in much esteem with th’ King, and truly
==110==A worthy friend. The King has made him Master
==111==O’ th’ Jewel House,
==112==And one, already, of the Privy Council.

**2. GENT.**
==113==He will deserve more.

**3. GENT.**
==113==              Yes, without all doubt.
==114==Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which
==115==Is to th’ court, and there ye shall be my guests;
==116==Something I can command. As I walk thither,
==117==I’ll tell ye more.

**BOTH 1. GENT. AND 2. GENT.**
==117==        You may command us, sir.

*Exeunt.*
