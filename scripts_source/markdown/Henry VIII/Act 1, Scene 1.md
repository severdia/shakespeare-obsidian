## Act 1, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Prologue|← Act 1, Prologue]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*London. An ante-chamber in the palace.*

*Enter the Duke of Norfolk at one door; at the other, the Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Abergavenny.*

**BUCK.**
==1==Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
==2==Since last we saw in France?

**NOR.**
==2==                I thank your Grace:
==3==Healthful, and ever since a fresh admirer
==4==Of what I saw there.

**BUCK.**
==4==           An untimely ague
==5==Stay’d me a prisoner in my chamber when
==6==Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
==7==Met in the vale of Andren.

**NOR.**
==7==              ’Twixt Guynes and Arde⁠—
==8==I was then present, saw them salute on horseback,
==9==Beheld them when they lighted, how they clung
==10==In their embracement, as they grew together,
==11==Which had they, what four thron’d ones could have weigh’d
==12==Such a compounded one?

**BUCK.**
==12==              All the whole time
==13==I was my chamber’s prisoner.

**NOR.**
==13==                Then you lost
==14==The view of earthly glory. Men might say
==15==Till this time pomp was single, but now married
==16==To one above itself. Each following day
==17==Became the next day’s master, till the last
==18==Made former wonders its. Today the French,
==19==All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
==20==Shone down the English; and, tomorrow, they
==21==Made Britain India: every man that stood
==22==Show’d like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
==23==As cherubins, all gilt; the madams too,
==24==Not us’d to toil, did almost sweat to bear
==25==The pride upon them, that their very labor
==26==Was to them as a painting. Now this masque
==27==Was cried incomparable; and th’ ensuing night
==28==Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
==29==Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
==30==As presence did present them: him in eye
==31==Still him in praise, and being present both,
==32==’Twas said they saw but one, and no discerner
==33==Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns
==34==(For so they phrase ’em) by their heralds challeng’d
==35==The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
==36==Beyond thought’s compass, that former fabulous story,
==37==Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
==38==That Bevis was believ’d.

**BUCK.**
==38==              O, you go far.

**NOR.**
==39==As I belong to worship and affect
==40==In honor honesty, the tract of ev’ry thing
==41==Would by a good discourser lose some life,
==42==Which action’s self was tongue to. All was royal;
==43==To the disposing of it nought rebell’d,
==44==Order gave each thing view; the office did
==45==Distinctly his full function.

**BUCK.**
==45==              Who did guide⁠—
==46==I mean, who set the body and the limbs
==47==Of this great sport together, as you guess?

**NOR.**
==48==One, certes, that promises no element
==49==In such a business.

**BUCK.**
==49==           I pray you, who, my lord?

**NOR.**
==50==All this was ord’red by the good discretion
==51==Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.

**BUCK.**
==52==The devil speed him! No man’s pie is freed
==53==From his ambitious finger. What had he
==54==To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
==55==That such a keech can with his very bulk
==56==Take up the rays o’ th’ beneficial sun,
==57==And keep it from the earth.

**NOR.**
==57==                Surely, sir,
==58==There’s in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
==59==For being not propp’d by ancestry, whose grace
==60==Chalks successors their way, nor call’d upon
==61==For high feats done to th’ crown, neither allied
==62==To eminent assistants, but spider-like
==63==Out of his self-drawing web, ’a gives us note
==64==The force of his own merit makes his way⁠—
==65==A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys
==66==A place next to the King.

**ABER.**
==66==              I cannot tell
==67==What heaven hath given him—let some graver eye
==68==Pierce into that—but I can see his pride
==69==Peep through each part of him. Whence has he that?
==70==If not from hell, the devil is a niggard,
==71==Or has given all before, and he begins
==72==A new hell in himself.

**BUCK.**
==72==              Why the devil,
==73==Upon this French going out, took he upon him
==74==(Without the privity o’ th’ King) t’ appoint
==75==Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
==76==Of all the gentry; for the most part such
==77==To whom as great a charge as little honor
==78==He meant to lay upon; and his own letter,
==79==The honorable Board of Council out,
==80==Must fetch him in he papers.

**ABER.**
==80==                I do know
==81==Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
==82==By this so sicken’d their estates, that never
==83==They shall abound as formerly.

**BUCK.**
==83==                  O, many
==84==Have broke their backs with laying manors on ’em
==85==For this great journey. What did this vanity
==86==But minister communication of
==87==A most poor issue?

**NOR.**
==87==           Grievingly I think
==88==The peace between the French and us not values
==89==The cost that did conclude it.

**BUCK.**
==89==                Every man,
==90==After the hideous storm that follow’d, was
==91==A thing inspir’d, and, not consulting, broke
==92==Into a general prophecy: that this tempest,
==93==Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
==94==The sudden breach on’t.

**NOR.**
==94==              Which is budded out,
==95==For France hath flaw’d the league, and hath attach’d
==96==Our merchants’ goods at Bordeaux.

**ABER.**
==96==                  Is it therefore
==97==Th’ ambassador is silenc’d?

**NOR.**
==97==              Marry, is’t.

**ABER.**
==98==A proper title of a peace, and purchas’d
==99==At a superfluous rate!

**BUCK.**
==99==           Why, all this business
==100==Our reverend Cardinal carried.

**NOR.**
==100==                Like it your Grace,
==101==The state takes notice of the private difference
==102==Betwixt you and the Cardinal. I advise you
==103==(And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
==104==Honor and plenteous safety) that you read
==105==The Cardinal’s malice and his potency
==106==Together; to consider further, that
==107==What his high hatred would effect wants not
==108==A minister in his power. You know his nature,
==109==That he’s revengeful; and I know his sword
==110==Hath a sharp edge; it’s long, and’t may be said
==111==It reaches far, and where ’twill not extend,
==112==Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,
==113==You’ll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
==114==That I advise your shunning.

*Enter Cardinal Wolsey, the purse borne before him, certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with papers.*

*The Cardinal in his passage fixeth his eye an Buckingham, and Buckingham on him, both full of disdain.*

**WOL.**
==115==The Duke of Buckingham’s surveyor? Ha?
==116==Where’s his examination?

**1. WOL. SECR.**
==116==              Here, so please you.

**WOL.**
==117==Is he in person ready?

**1. WOL. SECR.**
==117==           Ay, please your Grace.

**WOL.**
==118==Well, we shall then know more, and Buckingham
==119==Shall lessen this big look.

*Exeunt Cardinal and his Train.*

**BUCK.**
==120==This butcher’s cur is venom’d-mouth’d, and I
==121==Have not the power to muzzle him, therefore best
==122==Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar’s book
==123==Outworths a noble’s blood.

**NOR.**
==123==              What, are you chaf’d?
==124==Ask God for temp’rance, that’s th’ appliance only
==125==Which your disease requires.

**BUCK.**
==125==                I read in ’s looks
==126==Matter against me, and his eye revil’d
==127==Me as his abject object; at this instant
==128==He bores me with some trick. He’s gone to th’ King;
==129==I’ll follow and outstare him.

**NOR.**
==129==                Stay, my lord,
==130==And let your reason with your choler question
==131==What ’tis you go about: to climb steep hills
==132==Requires slow pace at first. Anger is like
==133==A full hot horse, who being allow’d his way,
==134==Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
==135==Can advise me like you; be to yourself
==136==As you would to your friend.

**BUCK.**
==136==                I’ll to the King,
==137==And from a mouth of honor quite cry down
==138==This Ipswich fellow’s insolence; or proclaim
==139==There’s difference in no persons.

**NOR.**
==139==                  Be advis’d;
==140==Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
==141==That it do singe yourself. We may outrun
==142==By violent swiftness that which we run at,
==143==And lose by overrunning. Know you not
==144==The fire that mounts the liquor till’t run o’er
==145==In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advis’d;
==146==I say again, there is no English soul
==147==More stronger to direct you than yourself,
==148==If with the sap of reason you would quench,
==149==Or but allay, the fire of passion.

**BUCK.**
==149==                  Sir,
==150==I am thankful to you, and I’ll go along
==151==By your prescription; but this top-proud fellow,
==152==Whom from the flow of gall I name not, but
==153==From sincere motions, by intelligence,
==154==And proofs as clear as founts in July when
==155==We see each grain of gravel, I do know
==156==To be corrupt and treasonous.

**NOR.**
==156==                Say not treasonous.

**BUCK.**
==157==To th’ King I’ll say’t, and make my vouch as strong
==158==As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
==159==Or wolf, or both (for he is equal rav’nous
==160==As he is subtile, and as prone to mischief
==161==As able to perform’t), his mind and place
==162==Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally,
==163==Only to show his pomp as well in France
==164==As here at home, suggests the King our master
==165==To this last costly treaty—th’ interview
==166==That swallowed so much treasure, and like a glass
==167==Did break i’ th’ wrenching.

**NOR.**
==167==              Faith, and so it did.

**BUCK.**
==168==Pray give me favor, sir: this cunning Cardinal
==169==The articles o’ th’ combination drew
==170==As himself pleas’d; and they were ratified
==171==As he cried, “Thus let be!” to as much end
==172==As give a crutch to th’ dead. But our count-cardinal
==173==Has done this, and ’tis well; for worthy Wolsey
==174==(Who cannot err), he did it. Now this follows
==175==(Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
==176==To th’ old dam, treason), Charles the Emperor,
==177==Under pretense to see the Queen his aunt
==178==(For ’twas indeed his color, but he came
==179==To whisper Wolsey), here makes visitation⁠—
==180==His fears were that the interview betwixt
==181==England and France might through their amity
==182==Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
==183==Peep’d harms that menac’d him—privily
==184==Deals with our Cardinal, and, as I trow⁠—
==185==Which I do well, for I am sure the Emperor
==186==Paid ere he promis’d, whereby his suit was granted
==187==Ere it was ask’d—but when the way was made
==188==And pav’d with gold, the Emperor thus desir’d,
==189==That he would please to alter the King’s course,
==190==And break the foresaid peace. Let the King know
==191==(As soon he shall by me) that thus the Cardinal
==192==Does buy and sell his honor as he pleases,
==193==And for his own advantage.

**NOR.**
==193==                I am sorry
==194==To hear this of him; and could wish he were
==195==Something mistaken in’t.

**BUCK.**
==195==              No, not a syllable:
==196==I do pronounce him in that very shape
==197==He shall appear in proof.

*Enter Brandon, a Sergeant at Arms before him, and two or three of the Guard.*

**BRAN.**
==198==Your office, sergeant; execute it.

**SERG.**
==198==                  Sir,
==199==My lord the Duke of Buckingham and Earl
==200==Of Herford, Stafford, and Northampton, I
==201==Arrest thee of high treason, in the name
==202==Of our most sovereign King.

**BUCK.**
==202==                Lo you, my lord,
==203==The net has fall’n upon me! I shall perish
==204==Under device and practice.

**BRAN.**
==204==              I am sorry
==205==To see you ta’en from liberty, to look on
==206==The business present. ’Tis his Highness’ pleasure
==207==You shall to th’ Tower.

**BUCK.**
==207==              It will help me nothing
==208==To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
==209==Which makes my whit’st part black. The will of heav’n
==210==Be done in this and all things! I obey.
==211==O my Lord Aburga’ny, fare you well!

**BRAN.**
==212==Nay, he must bear you company.
*(To Abergavenny.)*
==212==                  The King
==213==Is pleas’d you shall to th’ Tower, till you know
==214==How he determines further.

**ABER.**
==214==              As the Duke said,
==215==The will of heaven be done, and the King’s pleasure
==216==By me obey’d!

**BRAN.**
==216==        Here is a warrant from
==217==The King t’ attach Lord Montacute, and the bodies
==218==Of the Duke’s confessor, John de la Car,
==219==One Gilbert Perk, his chancellor⁠—

**BUCK.**
==219==                     So, so;
==220==These are the limbs o’ th’ plot. No more, I hope?

**BRAN.**
==221==A monk o’ th’ Chartreux.

**BUCK.**
==221==              O, Nicholas Hopkins?

**BRAN.**
==221==                         He.

**BUCK.**
==222==My surveyor is false; the o’er-great Cardinal
==223==Hath show’d him gold; my life is spann’d already.
==224==I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
==225==Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on
==226==By dark’ning my clear sun. My lord, farewell.

*Exeunt.*
