## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The lobby before the council chamber.*

*Pursuivants, Pages, etc., attending. Enter Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury.*

**CRAN.**
==1==I hope I am not too late, and yet the gentleman
==2==That was sent to me from the Council pray’d me
==3==To make great haste. All fast? What means this? Ho!
==4==Who waits there? Sure you know me?

*Enter Doorkeeper of the Council Chamber.*

**DOORKEEP.**
==4==                     Yes, my lord;
==5==But yet I cannot help you.

**CRAN.**
==6==Why?

**DOORKEEP.**
==7==Your Grace must wait till you be call’d for.

*Enter Doctor Butts.*

**CRAN.**
==7==                         So.

**BUTTS.**
*(Aside.)*
==8==This is a piece of malice. I am glad
==9==I came this way so happily; the King
==10==Shall understand it presently.

*Exit Butts.*

**CRAN.**
*(Aside.)*
==10==                  ’Tis Butts,
==11==The King’s physician. As he pass’d along,
==12==How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
==13==Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace! For certain
==14==This is of purpose laid by some that hate me
==15==(God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice) 
==16==To quench mine honor; they would shame to make me
==17==Wait else at door, a fellow Councillor,
==18==’Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures
==19==Must be fulfill’d, and I attend with patience.

*Enter the King and Butts at a window above.*

**BUTTS.**
==20==I’ll show your Grace the strangest sight⁠—

**KING.**
==20==                     What’s that, Butts?

**BUTTS.**
==21==I think your Highness saw this many a day.

**KING.**
==22==Body a’ me, where is it?

**BUTTS.**
==22==              There, my lord:
==23==The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury,
==24==Who holds his state at door ’mongst pursuivants,
==25==Pages, and footboys.

**KING.**
==25==           Ha? ’Tis he indeed.
==26==Is this the honor they do one another?
==27==’Tis well there’s one above ’em yet. I had thought
==28==They had parted so much honesty among ’em⁠—
==29==At least good manners—as not thus to suffer
==30==A man of his place, and so near our favor,
==31==To dance attendance on their lordships’ pleasures,
==32==And at the door too, like a post with packets.
==33==By holy Mary, Butts, there’s knavery.
==34==Let ’em alone, and draw the curtain close;
==35==We shall hear more anon.

*Curtain, above, partially drawn, but the King and Butts remain listening.*

*A council-table brought in with chairs and stools, and placed under the state.*

*Enter Lord Chancellor; places himself at the upper end of the table on the left hand; a seat being left void above him, as for Canterbury’s seat.*

*Duke of Suffolk, Duke of Norfolk, Surrey, Lord Chamberlain, Gardiner seat themselves in order on each side, Cromwell at lower end, as secretary.*

**CHAN.**
==36==Speak to the business, Master Secretary.
==37==Why are we met in Council?

**CROM.**
==37==                Please your honors,
==38==The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury.

**BISH. WIN.**
==39==Has he had knowledge of it?

**CROM.**
==39==                Yes.

**NOR.**
==39==                  Who waits there?

**DOORKEEP.**
==40==Without, my noble lords?

**BISH. WIN.**
==40==              Yes.

**DOORKEEP.**
==40==                  My Lord Archbishop;
==41==And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.

**CHAN.**
==42==Let him come in.

**DOORKEEP.**
==42==           Your Grace may enter now.

*Cranmer approaches the council-table.*

**CHAN.**
==43==My good Lord Archbishop, I’m very sorry
==44==To sit here at this present, and behold
==45==That chair stand empty; but we all are men,
==46==In our own natures frail, and capable
==47==Of our flesh; few are angels; out of which frailty
==48==And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
==49==Have misdemean’d yourself, and not a little:
==50==Toward the King first, then his laws, in filling
==51==The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains’
==52==(For so we are inform’d) with new opinions,
==53==Diverse and dangerous; which are heresies,
==54==And, not reform’d, may prove pernicious.

**BISH. WIN.**
==55==Which reformation must be sudden too,
==56==My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
==57==Pace ’em not in their hands to make ’em gentle,
==58==But stop their mouths with stubborn bits and spur ’em
==59==Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,
==60==Out of our easiness and childish pity
==61==To one man’s honor, this contagious sickness,
==62==Farewell all physic! And what follows then?
==63==Commotions, uproars, with a general taint
==64==Of the whole state; as of late days our neighbors,
==65==The upper Germany, can dearly witness,
==66==Yet freshly pitied in our memories.

**CRAN.**
==67==My good lords: hitherto, in all the progress
==68==Both of my life and office, I have labor’d,
==69==And with no little study, that my teaching
==70==And the strong course of my authority
==71==Might go one way, and safely; and the end
==72==Was ever to do well; nor is there living
==73==(I speak it with a single heart, my lords) 
==74==A man that more detests, more stirs against,
==75==Both in his private conscience and his place,
==76==Defacers of a public peace than I do.
==77==Pray heaven the King may never find a heart
==78==With less allegiance in it! Men that make
==79==Envy and crooked malice nourishment
==80==Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,
==81==That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
==82==Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
==83==And freely urge against me.

**SUF.**
==83==                Nay, my lord,
==84==That cannot be; you are a Councillor,
==85==And by that virtue no man dare accuse you.

**BISH. WIN.**
==86==My lord, because we have business of more moment,
==87==We will be short with you. ’Tis his Highness’ pleasure
==88==And our consent, for better trial of you,
==89==From hence you be committed to the Tower,
==90==Where being but a private man again,
==91==You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,
==92==More than (I fear) you are provided for.

**CRAN.**
==93==Ah, my good Lord of Winchester—I thank you,
==94==You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
==95==I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
==96==You are so merciful. I see your end,
==97==’Tis my undoing. Love and meekness, lord,
==98==Become a churchman better than ambition;
==99==Win straying souls with modesty again,
==100==Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
==101==Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
==102==I make as little doubt as you do conscience
==103==In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
==104==But reverence to your calling makes me modest.

**BISH. WIN.**
==105==My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,
==106==That’s the plain truth. Your painted gloss discovers,
==107==To men that understand you, words and weakness.

**CROM.**
==108==My Lord of Winchester, y’ are a little,
==109==By your good favor, too sharp; men so noble,
==110==However faulty, yet should find respect
==111==For what they have been. ’Tis a cruelty
==112==To load a falling man.

**BISH. WIN.**
==112==           Good Master Secretary,
==113==I cry your honor mercy; you may worst
==114==Of all this table say so.

**CROM.**
==114==              Why, my lord?

**BISH. WIN.**
==115==Do not I know you for a favorer
==116==Of this new sect? Ye are not sound.

**CROM.**
==116==                  Not sound?

**BISH. WIN.**
==117==Not sound, I say.

**CROM.**
==117==           Would you were half so honest!
==118==Men’s prayers then would seek you, not their fears.

**BISH. WIN.**
==119==I shall remember this bold language.

**CROM.**
==119==                     Do.
==120==Remember your bold life too.

**CHAN.**
==120==                This is too much.
==121==Forbear for shame, my lords.

**BISH. WIN.**
==121==                I have done.

**CROM.**
==121==                         And I.

**CHAN.**
==122==Then thus for you, my lord, it stands agreed,
==123==I take it, by all voices: that forthwith
==124==You be convey’d to th’ Tower a prisoner;
==125==There to remain till the King’s further pleasure
==126==Be known unto us. Are you all agreed, lords?

**ALL NOR., SUF., SUR., CHAM.**
==127==We are.

**CRAN.**
==127==    Is there no other way of mercy
==128==But I must needs to th’ Tower, my lords?

**BISH. WIN.**
==128==                     What other
==129==Would you expect? You are strangely troublesome.
==130==Let some o’ th’ guard be ready there.

*Enter the Guard.*

**CRAN.**
==130==                     For me?
==131==Must I go like a traitor thither?

**BISH. WIN.**
==131==                  Receive him,
==132==And see him safe i’ th’ Tower.

**CRAN.**
==132==                Stay, good my lords,
==133==I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;
==134==By virtue of that ring, I take my cause
==135==Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it
==136==To a most noble judge, the King my master.

**CHAM.**
==137==This is the King’s ring.

**SUR.**
==137==              ’Tis no counterfeit.

**SUF.**
==138==’Tis the right ring, by heav’n! I told ye all,
==139==When we first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,
==140==’Twould fall upon ourselves.

**NOR.**
==140==              Do you think, my lords,
==141==The King will suffer but the little finger
==142==Of this man to be vex’d?

**CHAM.**
==142==              ’Tis now too certain.
==143==How much more is his life in value with him!
*(Exeunt King and Butts above.)*
==144==Would I were fairly out on’t!

**CROM.**
==144==                My mind gave me,
==145==In seeking tales and informations
==146==Against this man, whose honesty the devil
==147==And his disciples only envy at,
==148==Ye blew the fire that burns ye. Now have at ye!

*Enter King frowning on them; takes his seat.*

**BISH. WIN.**
==149==Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven
==150==In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince,
==151==Not only good and wise but most religious;
==152==One that, in all obedience, makes the Church
==153==The chief aim of his honor, and to strengthen
==154==That holy duty, out of dear respect,
==155==His royal self in judgment comes to hear
==156==The cause betwixt her and this great offender.

**KING.**
==157==You were ever good at sudden commendations,
==158==Bishop of Winchester. But know I come not
==159==To hear such flattery now, and in my presence
==160==They are too thin and base to hide offenses.
==161==To me you cannot reach you play the spaniel,
==162==And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
==163==But whatsoe’er thou tak’st me for, I’m sure
==164==Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
*(To Cranmer.)*
==165==Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest
==166==He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee.
==167==By all that’s holy, he had better starve
==168==Than but once think his place becomes thee not.

**SUR.**
==169==May it please your Grace⁠—

**KING.**
==169==              No, sir, it does not please me.
==170==I had thought I had had men of some understanding
==171==And wisdom of my Council; but I find none.
==172==Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
==173==This good man (few of you deserve that title),
==174==This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
==175==At chamber-door? And one as great as you are?
==176==Why, what a shame was this? Did my commission
==177==Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
==178==Power as he was a Councillor to try him,
==179==Not as a groom. There’s some of ye, I see,
==180==More out of malice than integrity,
==181==Would try him to the utmost had ye mean,
==182==Which ye shall never have while I live.

**CHAN.**
==182==                     Thus far,
==183==My most dread sovereign, may it like your Grace
==184==To let my tongue excuse all. What was purpos’d
==185==Concerning his imprisonment was rather
==186==(If there be faith in men) meant for his trial
==187==And fair purgation to the world than malice,
==188==I’m sure, in me.

**KING.**
==188==        Well, well, my lords, respect him,
==189==Take him, and use him well; he’s worthy of it.
==190==I will say thus much for him, if a prince
==191==May be beholding to a subject, I
==192==Am for his love and service so to him.
==193==Make me no more ado, but all embrace him.
==194==Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of Canterbury,
==195==I have a suit which you must not deny me:
==196==That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,
==197==You must be godfather, and answer for her.

**CRAN.**
==198==The greatest monarch now alive may glory
==199==In such an honor; how may I deserve it,
==200==That am a poor and humble subject to you?

**KING.**
==201==Come, come, my lord, you’d spare your spoons. You shall have
==202==Two noble partners with you, the old Duchess of Norfolk
==203==And Lady Marquess Dorset. Will these please you?
==204==Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,
==205==Embrace and love this man.

**BISH. WIN.**
==205==              With a true heart
==206==And brother-love I do it.

**CRAN.**
==206==              And let heaven
==207==Witness how dear I hold this confirmation.

**KING.**
==208==Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart.
==209==The common voice, I see, is verified
==210==Of thee, which says thus, “Do my Lord of Canterbury
==211==A shrewd turn, and he’s your friend forever.”
==212==Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long
==213==To have this young one made a Christian.
==214==As I have made ye one, lords, one remain:
==215==So I grow stronger, you more honor gain.

*Exeunt.*
