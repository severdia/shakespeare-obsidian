## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Westminster. A street.*

*Enter two Gentlemen at several doors.*

**1. GENT.**
==1== Whither away so fast?

**2. GENT.**
==1==               O, God save ye!
==2== Ev’n to the hall, to hear what shall become
==3== Of the great Duke of Buckingham.

**1. GENT.**
==3==                   I’ll save you
==4== That labor, sir. All’s now done but the ceremony
==5== Of bringing back the prisoner.

**2. GENT.**
==5==                 Were you there?

**1. GENT.**
==6== Yes indeed was I.

**2. GENT.**
==6==            Pray speak what has happen’d.

**1. GENT.**
==7== You may guess quickly what.

**2. GENT.**
==7==                 Is he found guilty?

**1. GENT.**
==8== Yes, truly is he, and condemn’d upon’t.

**2. GENT.**
==9== I am sorry for’t.

**1. GENT.**
==9==         So are a number more.

**2. GENT.**
==10== But pray how pass’d it?

**1. GENT.**
==11== I’ll tell you in a little. The great Duke
==12== Came to the bar; where to his accusations
==13== He pleaded still not guilty, and alleged
==14== Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
==15== The King’s attorney on the contrary
==16== Urg’d on the examinations, proofs, confessions
==17== Of diverse witnesses, which the Duke desir’d
==18== To him brought *vivâ voce* to his face;
==19== At which appear’d against him his surveyor,
==20== Sir Gilbert Perk his chancellor, and John Car,
==21== Confessor to him, with that devil monk,
==22== Hopkins, that made this mischief.

**2. GENT.**
==22==                   That was he
==23== That fed him with his prophecies?

**1. GENT.**
==23==                   The same;
==24== All these accus’d him strongly, which he fain
==25== Would have flung from him; but indeed he could not.
==26== And so his peers upon this evidence
==27== Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
==28== He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
==29== Was either pitied in him or forgotten.

**2. GENT.**
==30== After all this, how did he bear himself?

**1. GENT.**
==31== When he was brought again to th’ bar, to hear
==32== His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr’d
==33== With such an agony he sweat extremely,
==34== And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty.
==35== But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
==36== In all the rest show’d a most noble patience.

**2. GENT.**
==37== I do not think he fears death.

**1. GENT.**
==37==                 Sure he does not,
==38== He never was so womanish. The cause
==39== He may a little grieve at.

**2. GENT.**
==39==               Certainly
==40== The Cardinal is the end of this.

**1. GENT.**
==40==                   ’Tis likely,
==41== By all conjectures: first, Kildare’s attendure,
==42== Then deputy of Ireland, who remov’d,
==43== Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,
==44== Lest he should help his father.

**2. GENT.**
==44==                 That trick of state
==45== Was a deep envious one.

**1. GENT.**
==45==               At his return
==46== No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,
==47== And generally, whoever the King favors,
==48== The Card’nal instantly will find employment,
==49== And far enough from court too.

**2. GENT.**
==49==                   All the commons
==50== Hate him perniciously, and, o’ my conscience,
==51== Wish him ten fathom deep. This duke as much
==52== They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
==53== The mirror of all courtesy⁠—

*Enter Buckingham from his arraignment, Tipstaves before him, the axe with the edge towards him, Halberdiers on each side; accompanied with Sir Thomas Lovell, Sir Nicholas Vaux, Sir Walter Sands, and common people, etc.*

**1. GENT.**
==53==               Stay there, sir,
==54== And see the noble ruin’d man you speak of.

**2. GENT.**
==55== Let’s stand close and behold him.

**BUCK.**
==55==                   All good people,
==56== You that thus far have come to pity me,
==57== Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
==58== I have this day receiv’d a traitor’s judgment,
==59== And by that name must die; yet, heaven bear witness,
==60== And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,
==61== Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
==62== The law I bear no malice for my death;
==63== ’T has done, upon the premises, but justice;
==64== But those that sought it I could wish more Christians.
==65== Be what they will, I heartily forgive ’em;
==66== Yet let ’em look they glory not in mischief,
==67== Nor build their evils on the graves of great men,
==68== For then my guiltless blood must cry against ’em.
==69== For further life in this world I ne’er hope,
==70== Nor will I sue, although the King have mercies
==71== More than I dare make faults. You few that lov’d me
==72== And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
==73== His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
==74== Is only bitter to him, only dying,
==75== Go with me like good angels to my end,
==76== And as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
==77== Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
==78== And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on a’ God’s name.

**LOV.**
==79== I do beseech your Grace, for charity,
==80== If ever any malice in your heart
==81== Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.

**BUCK.**
==82== Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
==83== As I would be forgiven. I forgive all.
==84== There cannot be those numberless offenses
==85== ’Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with; no black envy
==86== Shall make my grave. Commend me to his Grace;
==87== And if he speak of Buckingham, pray tell him
==88== You met him half in heaven. My vows and prayers
==89== Yet are the King’s; and, till my soul forsake,
==90== Shall cry for blessings on him. May he live
==91== Longer than I have time to tell his years;
==92== Ever belov’d and loving may his rule be;
==93== And when old Time shall lead him to his end,
==94== Goodness and he fill up one monument!

**LOV.**
==95== To th’ water side I must conduct your Grace;
==96== Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
==97== Who undertakes you to your end.

**VAUX.**
==97==                   Prepare there,
==98== The Duke is coming. See the barge be ready;
==99== And fit it with such furniture as suits
==100== The greatness of his person.

**BUCK.**
==100==                 Nay, Sir Nicholas,
==101== Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
==102== When I came hither, I was Lord High Constable
==103== And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun.
==104== Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
==105== That never knew what truth meant. I now seal it;
==106== And with that blood will make ’em one day groan for’t.
==107== My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
==108== Who first rais’d head against usurping Richard,
==109== Flying for succor to his servant Banister,
==110== Being distress’d, was by that wretch betray’d,
==111== And without trial fell; God’s peace be with him!
==112== Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
==113== My father’s loss, like a most royal prince
==114== Restor’d me to my honors; and out of ruins
==115== Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
==116== Henry the Eight, life, honor, name, and all
==117== That made me happy, at one stroke has taken
==118== Forever from the world. I had my trial,
==119== And must needs say a noble one; which makes me
==120== A little happier than my wretched father.
==121== Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
==122== Fell by our servants, by those men we lov’d most;
==123== A most unnatural and faithless service.
==124== Heaven has an end in all; yet, you that hear me,
==125== This from a dying man receive as certain:
==126== Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels,
==127== Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
==128== And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
==129== The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
==130== Like water from ye, never found again
==131== But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
==132== Pray for me! I must now forsake ye. The last hour
==133== Of my long weary life is come upon me.
==134== Farewell!
==135== And when you would say something that is sad,
==136== Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!

*Exeunt Duke and Train.*

**1. GENT.**
==137== O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
==138== I fear, too many curses on their heads
==139== That were the authors.

**2. GENT.**
==139==            If the Duke be guiltless,
==140== ’Tis full of woe; yet I can give you inkling
==141== Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
==142== Greater than this.

**1. GENT.**
==142==            Good angels keep it from us!
==143== What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?

**2. GENT.**
==144== This secret is so weighty, ’twill require
==145== A strong faith to conceal it.

**1. GENT.**
==145==               Let me have it;
==146== I do not talk much.

**2. GENT.**
==146==            I am confident;
==147== You shall, sir. Did you not of late days hear
==148== A buzzing of a separation
==149== Between the King and Katherine?

**1. GENT.**
==149==                 Yes, but it held not;
==150== For when the King once heard it, out of anger
==151== He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight
==152== To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues
==153== That durst disperse it.

**2. GENT.**
==153==               But that slander, sir,
==154== Is found a truth now; for it grows again
==155== Fresher than e’er it was, and held for certain
==156== The King will venture at it. Either the Cardinal,
==157== Or some about him near, have out of malice
==158== To the good Queen possess’d him with a scruple
==159== That will undo her. To confirm this too,
==160== Cardinal Campeius is arriv’d, and lately,
==161== As all think, for this business.

**1. GENT.**
==161==                 ’Tis the Cardinal;
==162== And merely to revenge him on the Emperor
==163== For not bestowing on him at his asking
==164== The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purpos’d.

**2. GENT.**
==165== I think you have hit the mark; but is’t not cruel.
==166== That she should feel the smart of this? The Cardinal
==167== Will have his will, and she must fall.

**1. GENT.**
==167==                      ’Tis woeful.
==168== We are too open here to argue this;
==169== Let’s think in private more.

*Exeunt.*
