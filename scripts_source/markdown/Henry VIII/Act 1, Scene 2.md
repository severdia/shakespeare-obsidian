## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*London. The council chamber.*

*Cornets. Enter King Henry, leaning on the Cardinal’s shoulder, the Nobles, and Sir Thomas Lovell; the Cardinal places himself under the King’s feet on his right side, his Secretary in attendance.*

**KING.**
==1== My life itself, and the best heart of it,
==2== Thanks you for this great care. I stood i’ th’ level
==3== Of a full-charg’d confederacy, and give thanks
==4== To you that chok’d it. Let be call’d before us
==5== That gentleman of Buckingham’s; in person
==6== I’ll hear him his confessions justify,
==7== And point by point the treasons of his master
==8== He shall again relate.

*A noise within, crying, “Room for the Queen!” who is usher’d by the Duke of Norfolk.*

*Enter the Queen Katherine, Norfolk, and Suffolk; she kneels.*

*The King riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses, and placeth her by him.*

**Q. KATH.**
==9== Nay, we must longer kneel; I am a suitor.

**KING.**
==10== Arise, and take place by us. Half your suit
==11== Never name to us; you have half our power.
==12== The other moi’ty ere you ask is given;
==13== Repeat your will and take it.

**Q. KATH.**
==13==                 Thank your Majesty.
==14== That you would love yourself, and in that love
==15== Not unconsidered leave your honor nor
==16== The dignity of your office, is the point
==17== Of my petition.

**KING.**
==17==         Lady mine, proceed.

**Q. KATH.**
==18== I am solicited, not by a few,
==19== And those of true condition, that your subjects
==20== Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
==21== Sent down among ’em, which hath flaw’d the heart
==22== Of all their loyalties; wherein, although,
==23== My good Lord Cardinal, they vent reproaches
==24== Most bitterly on you as putter-on
==25== Of these exactions, yet the King our master⁠—
==26== Whose honor heaven shield from soil!—even he escapes not
==27== Language unmannerly; yea, such which breaks
==28== The sides of loyalty, and almost appears
==29== In loud rebellion.

**NOR.**
==29==            Not almost appears,
==30== It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,
==31== The clothiers all, not able to maintain
==32== The many to them ’longing, have put off
==33== The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,
==34== Unfit for other life, compell’d by hunger
==35== And lack of other means, in desperate manner
==36== Daring th’ event to th’ teeth, are all in uproar,
==37== And danger serves among them.

**KING.**
==37==                   Taxation?
==38== Wherein? And what taxation? My Lord Cardinal,
==39== You that are blam’d for it alike with us,
==40== Know you of this taxation?

**WOL.**
==40==               Please you, sir,
==41== I know but of a single part in aught
==42== Pertains to th’ state; and front but in that file
==43== Where others tell steps with me.

**Q. KATH.**
==43==                   No, my lord?
==44== You know no more than others? But you frame
==45== Things that are known alike, which are not wholesome
==46== To those which would not know them, and yet must
==47== Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions
==48== (Whereof my sovereign would have note), they are
==49== Most pestilent to th’ hearing, and, to bear ’em,
==50== The back is sacrifice to th’ load. They say
==51== They are devis’d by you, or else you suffer
==52== Too hard an exclamation.

**KING.**
==52==               Still exaction!
==53== The nature of it? In what kind, let’s know,
==54== Is this exaction?

**Q. KATH.**
==54==            I am much too venturous
==55== In tempting of your patience; but am bold’ned
==56== Under your promis’d pardon. The subject’s grief
==57== Comes through commissions, which compels from each
==58== The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
==59== Without delay; and the pretense for this
==60== Is nam’d, your wars in France. This makes bold mouths,
==61== Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
==62== Allegiance in them; their curses now
==63== Live where their prayers did; and it’s come to pass
==64== This tractable obedience is a slave
==65== To each incensed will. I would your Highness
==66== Would give it quick consideration, for
==67== There is no primer baseness.

**KING.**
==67==                 By my life,
==68== This is against our pleasure.

**WOL.**
==68==               And for me,
==69== I have no further gone in this than by
==70== A single voice, and that not pass’d me but
==71== By learned approbation of the judges. If I am
==72== Traduc’d by ignorant tongues, which neither know
==73== My faculties nor person, yet will be
==74== The chronicles of my doing, let me say
==75== ’Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
==76== That virtue must go through. We must not stint
==77== Our necessary actions in the fear
==78== To cope malicious censurers, which ever,
==79== As rav’nous fishes, do a vessel follow
==80== That is new trimm’d, but benefit no further
==81== Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
==82== By sick interpreters (once weak ones) is
==83== Not ours, or not allow’d; what worst, as oft,
==84== Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
==85== For our best act. If we shall stand still,
==86== In fear our motion will be mock’d or carp’d at,
==87== We should take root here where we sit, or sit
==88== State-statues only.

**KING.**
==88==            Things done well
==89== And with a care exempt themselves from fear;
==90== Things done without example, in their issue
==91== Are to be fear’d. Have you a president
==92== Of this commission? I believe, not any.
==93== We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
==94== And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
==95== A trembling contribution! Why, we take
==96== From every tree, lop, bark, and part o’ th’ timber;
==97== And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack’d,
==98== The air will drink the sap. To every county
==99== Where this is question’d send our letters, with
==100== Free pardon to each man that has denied
==101== The force of this commission. Pray look to’t;
==102== I put it to your care.

**WOL.**
*(Aside to the First Secretary)*
==102==            A word with you.
==103== Let there be letters writ to every shire,
==104== Of the King’s grace and pardon. The grieved commons
==105== Hardly conceive of me; let it be nois’d
==106== That through our intercession this revokement
==107== And pardon comes. I shall anon advise you
==108== Further in the proceeding.

*Exit First Secretary.*

*Enter Buckingham’s Surveyor.*

**Q. KATH.**
==109== I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
==110== Is run in your displeasure.

**KING.**
==110==               It grieves many.
==111== The gentleman is learn’d, and a most rare speaker,
==112== To nature none more bound; his training such
==113== That he may furnish and instruct great teachers
==114== And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
==115== When these so noble benefits shall prove
==116== Not well dispos’d, the mind growing once corrupt,
==117== They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
==118== Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,
==119== Who was enroll’d ’mongst wonders, and when we,
==120== Almost with ravish’d list’ning, could not find
==121== His hour of speech a minute—he, my lady,
==122== Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
==123== That once were his, and is become as black
==124== As if besmear’d in hell. Sit by us, you shall hear
==125== (This was his gentleman in trust) of him
==126== Things to strike honor sad. Bid him recount
==127== The fore-recited practices, whereof
==128== We cannot feel too little, hear too much.

**WOL.**
==129== Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
==130== Most like a careful subject, have collected
==131== Out of the Duke of Buckingham.

**KING.**
==131==                   Speak freely.

**BUCK. SURV.**
==132== First, it was usual with him—every day
==133== It would infect his speech—that if the King
==134== Should without issue die, he’ll carry it so
==135== To make the scepter his. These very words
==136== I’ve heard him utter to his son-in-law,
==137== Lord Aburga’ny, to whom by oath he menac’d
==138== Revenge upon the Cardinal.

**WOL.**
==138==               Please your Highness note
==139== This dangerous conception in this point,
==140== Not friended by his wish, to your high person;
==141== His will is most malignant, and it stretches
==142== Beyond you to your friends.

**Q. KATH.**
==142==                 My learn’d Lord Cardinal,
==143== Deliver all with charity.

**KING.**
==143==               Speak on.
==144== How grounded he his title to the crown
==145== Upon our fail? To this point hast thou heard him
==146== At any time speak aught?

**BUCK. SURV.**
==146==               He was brought to this
==147== By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.

**KING.**
==148== What was that Hopkins?

**BUCK. SURV.**
==148==               Sir, a Chartreux friar,
==149== His confessor, who fed him every minute
==150== With words of sovereignty.

**KING.**
==150==               How know’st thou this?

**BUCK. SURV.**
==151== Not long before your Highness sped to France,
==152== The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish
==153== Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
==154== What was the speech among the Londoners
==155== Concerning the French journey. I replied,
==156== Men fear the French would prove perfidious,
==157== To the King’s danger. Presently the Duke
==158== Said, ’twas the fear indeed, and that he doubted
==159== ’Twould prove the verity of certain words
==160== Spoke by a holy monk “that oft,” says he,
==161== “Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
==162== John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
==163== To hear from him a matter of some moment;
==164== Whom after under the confession’s seal
==165== He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke
==166== My chaplain to no creature living but
==167== To me should utter, with demure confidence
==168== This pausingly ensu’d: ‘Neither the King nor ’s heirs
==169== (Tell you the Duke) shall prosper. Bid him strive
==170== To the love o’ th’ commonalty; the Duke
==171== Shall govern England.’”

**Q. KATH.**
==171==               If I know you well,
==172== You were the Duke’s surveyor, and lost your office
==173== On the complaint o’ th’ tenants. Take good heed
==174== You charge not in your spleen a noble person
==175== And spoil your nobler soul; I say, take heed;
==176== Yes, heartily beseech you.

**KING.**
==176==               Let him on.
==177== Go forward.

**BUCK. SURV.**
==177==         On my soul, I’ll speak but truth.
==178== I told my lord the Duke, by th’ devil’s illusions
==179== The monk might be deceiv’d, and that ’twas dangerous for him
==180== To ruminate on this so far, until
==181== It forg’d him some design, which being believ’d,
==182== It was much like to do. He answer’d, “Tush,
==183== It can do me no damage”; adding further
==184== That had the King in his last sickness fail’d,
==185== The Cardinal’s and Sir Thomas Lovell’s heads
==186== Should have gone off.

**KING.**
==186==               Ha? What, so rank? Ah ha,
==187== There’s mischief in this man. Canst thou say further?

**BUCK. SURV.**
==188== I can, my liege.

**KING.**
==188==         Proceed.

**BUCK. SURV.**
==188==               Being at Greenwich,
==189== After your Highness had reprov’d the Duke
==190== About Sir William Bulmer⁠—

**KING.**
==190==                 I remember
==191== Of such a time, being my sworn servant,
==192== The Duke retain’d him his. But on; what hence?

**BUCK. SURV.**
==193== “If,” quoth he, “I for this had been committed⁠—
==194== As to the Tower, I thought—I would have play’d
==195== The part my father meant to act upon
==196== Th’ usurper Richard, who, being at Salisbury,
==197== Made suit to come in ’s presence; which if granted,
==198== As he made semblance of his duty would
==199== Have put his knife into him.”

**KING.**
==199==                 A giant traitor!

**WOL.**
==200== Now, madam, may his Highness live in freedom,
==201== And this man out of prison?

**Q. KATH.**
==201==                 God mend all!

**KING.**
==202== There’s something more would out of thee; what say’st?

**BUCK. SURV.**
==203== After “the Duke his father,” with the “knife,”
==204== He stretch’d him, and with one hand on his dagger,
==205== Another spread on ’s breast, mounting his eyes,
==206== He did discharge a horrible oath, whose tenor
==207== Was, were he evil us’d, he would outgo
==208== His father by as much as a performance
==209== Does an irresolute purpose.

**KING.**
==209==               There’s his period,
==210== To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach’d,
==211== Call him to present trial. If he may
==212== Find mercy in the law, ’tis his; if none,
==213== Let him not seek’t of us. By day and night,
==214== He’s traitor to th’ height.

*Exeunt.*
