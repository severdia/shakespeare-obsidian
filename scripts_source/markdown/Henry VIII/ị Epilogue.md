## Epilogue
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]]

**EPILOGUE**
’Tis ten to one this play can never please
All that are here. Some come to take their ease,
And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear
W’ have frighted with our trumpets; so ’tis clear,
They’ll say ’tis naught; others to hear the city
Abus’d extremely, and to cry, “That’s witty!”
Which we have not done neither: that I fear
All the expected good w’ are like to hear
For this play at this time, is only in
The merciful construction of good women,
For such a one we show’d ’em. If they smile,
And say ’twill do, I know within a while
All the best men are ours; for ’tis ill hap
If they hold when their ladies bid ’em clap.
