## Act 1, Prologue
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 1|Act 1, Scene 1 →]]

**PRO.**
==1==I come no more to make you laugh; things now
==2==That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
==3==Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe:
==4==Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
==5==We now present. Those that can pity, here
==6==May (if they think it well) let fall a tear;
==7==The subject will deserve it. Such as give
==8==Their money out of hope they may believe,
==9==May here find truth too. Those that come to see
==10==Only a show or two, and so agree
==11==The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
==12==I’ll undertake may see away their shilling
==13==Richly in two short hours. Only they
==14==That come to hear a merry, bawdy play,
==15==A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
==16==In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
==17==Will be deceiv’d. For, gentle hearers, know,
==18==To rank our chosen truth with such a show
==19==As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
==20==Our own brains and the opinion that we bring
==21==To make that only true we now intend,
==22==Will leave us never an understanding friend.
==23==Therefore, for goodness sake, and as you are known
==24==The first and happiest hearers of the town,
==25==Be sad, as we would make ye. Think ye see
==26==The very persons of our noble story
==27==As they were living. Think you see them great,
==28==And follow’d with the general throng and sweat
==29==Of thousand friends; then, in a moment, see
==30==How soon this mightiness meets misery;
==31==And if you can be merry then, I’ll say
==32==A man may weep upon his wedding-day.
