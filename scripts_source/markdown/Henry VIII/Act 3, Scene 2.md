## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*London. Antechamber to King Henry VIII’s apartment.*

*Enter the Duke of Norfolk, Duke of Suffolk, Lord Surrey, and Lord Chamberlain.*

**NOR.**
==1==If you will now unite in your complaints,
==2==And force them with a constancy, the Cardinal
==3==Cannot stand under them. If you omit
==4==The offer of this time, I cannot promise
==5==But that you shall sustain more new disgraces
==6==With these you bear already.

**SUR.**
==6==                I am joyful
==7==To meet the least occasion that may give me
==8==Remembrance of my father-in-law, the Duke,
==9==To be reveng’d on him.

**SUF.**
==9==              Which of the peers
==10==Have uncontemn’d gone by him, or at least
==11==Strangely neglected? When did he regard
==12==The stamp of nobleness in any person
==13==Out of himself?

**CHAM.**
==13==        My lords, you speak your pleasures.
==14==What he deserves of you and me I know;
==15==What we can do to him (though now the time
==16==Gives way to us) I much fear. If you cannot
==17==Bar his access to th’ King, never attempt
==18==Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft
==19==Over the King in ’s tongue.

**NOR.**
==19==              O, fear him not,
==20==His spell in that is out. The King hath found
==21==Matter against him that forever mars
==22==The honey of his language. No, he’s settled
==23==(Not to come off) in his displeasure.

**SUR.**
==23==                     Sir,
==24==I should be glad to hear such news as this
==25==Once every hour.

**NOR.**
==25==           Believe it, this is true.
==26==In the divorce his contrary proceedings
==27==Are all unfolded; wherein he appears
==28==As I would wish mine enemy.

**SUR.**
==28==                How came
==29==His practices to light?

**SUF.**
==29==           Most strangely.

**SUR.**
==29==                     O how? How?

**SUF.**
==30==The Cardinal’s letters to the Pope miscarried,
==31==And came to th’ eye o’ th’ King, wherein was read
==32==How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness
==33==To stay the judgment o’ th’ divorce; for if
==34==It did take place, “I do,” quoth he, “perceive
==35==My king is tangled in affection to
==36==A creature of the Queen’s, Lady Anne Boleyn.”

**SUR.**
==37==Has the King this?

**SUF.**
==37==           Believe it.

**SUR.**
==37==                  Will this work?

**CHAM.**
==38==The King in this perceives him, how he coasts
==39==And hedges his own way. But in this point
==40==All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
==41==After his patient’s death. The King already
==42==Hath married the fair lady.

**SUR.**
==42==                Would he had!

**SUF.**
==43==May you be happy in your wish, my lord,
==44==For I profess you have it.

**SUR.**
==44==              Now all my joy
==45==Trace the conjunction!

**SUF.**
==45==              My amen to’t!

**NOR.**
==45==                       All men’s!

**SUF.**
==46==There’s order given for her coronation.
==47==Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left
==48==To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
==49==She is a gallant creature, and complete
==50==In mind and feature. I persuade me, from her
==51==Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall
==52==In it be memoriz’d.

**SUR.**
==52==           But will the King
==53==Digest this letter of the Cardinal’s?
==54==The Lord forbid!

**NOR.**
==54==        Marry, amen!

**SUF.**
==54==                  No, no;
==55==There be more wasps that buzz about his nose
==56==Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
==57==Is stol’n away to Rome, hath ta’en no leave,
==58==Has left the cause o’ th’ King unhandled, and
==59==Is posted, as the agent of our Cardinal,
==60==To second all his plot. I do assure you
==61==The King cried “Ha!” at this.

**CHAM.**
==61==                Now God incense him,
==62==And let him cry “Ha!” louder!

**NOR.**
==62==                But, my lord,
==63==When returns Cranmer?

**SUF.**
==64==He is return’d in his opinions, which
==65==Have satisfied the King for his divorce,
==66==Together with all famous colleges
==67==Almost in Christendom. Shortly, I believe,
==68==His second marriage shall be publish’d, and
==69==Her coronation. Katherine no more
==70==Shall be call’d Queen, but Princess Dowager
==71==And widow to Prince Arthur.

**NOR.**
==71==                This same Cranmer’s
==72==A worthy fellow, and hath ta’en much pain
==73==In the King’s business.

**SUF.**
==73==           He has, and we shall see him
==74==For it an archbishop.

**NOR.**
==74==           So I hear.

**SUF.**
==74==                  ’Tis so.
*(Enter Wolsey and Cromwell.)*
==75==The Cardinal!

**NOR.**
==75==        Observe, observe, he’s moody.

**WOL.**
==76==The packet, Cromwell, gave’t you the King?

**CROM.**
==77==To his own hand, in ’s bedchamber.

**WOL.**
==77==                  Look’d he
==78==O’ th’ inside of the paper?

**CROM.**
==78==              Presently
==79==He did unseal them, and the first he view’d,
==80==He did it with a serious mind; a heed
==81==Was in his countenance. You he bade
==82==Attend him here this morning.

**WOL.**
==82==                Is he ready
==83==To come abroad?

**CROM.**
==83==           I think by this he is.

**WOL.**
==84==Leave me a while.
*(Exit Cromwell.)*
*(Aside.)*
==85==It shall be to the Duchess of Alanson,
==86==The French king’s sister; he shall marry her.
==87==Anne Boleyn? No; I’ll no Anne Boleyns for him,
==88==There’s more in’t than fair visage. Boleyn?
==89==No, we’ll no Boleyns. Speedily I wish
==90==To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke?

**NOR.**
==91==He’s discontented.

**SUF.**
==91==           May be he hears the King
==92==Does whet his anger to him.

**SUR.**
==92==                Sharp enough,
==93==Lord, for thy justice!

**WOL.**
*(Aside.)*
==94==The late Queen’s gentlewoman? A knight’s daughter,
==95==To be her mistress’ mistress? The Queen’s queen?
==96==This candle burns not clear, ’tis I must snuff it,
==97==Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
==98==And well deserving? Yet I know her for
==99==A spleeny Lutheran, and not wholesome to
==100==Our cause, that she should lie i’ th’ bosom of
==101==Our hard-rul’d king. Again, there is sprung up
==102==An heretic, an arch-one, Cranmer; one
==103==Hath crawl’d into the favor of the King,
==104==And is his oracle.

**NOR.**
==104==           He’s vex’d at something.

*Enter King, reading of a schedule, and Lovell.*

**SUR.**
==105==I would ’twere something that would fret the string,
==106==The master-cord on ’s heart!

**SUF.**
==106==                The King, the King!

**KING.**
==107==What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
==108==To his own portion! And what expense by th’ hour
==109==Seems to flow from him! How, i’ th’ name of thrift,
==110==Does he rake this together? Now, my lords,
==111==Saw you the Cardinal?

**NOR.**
==111==              My lord, we have
==112==Stood here observing him. Some strange commotion
==113==Is in his brain; he bites his lip, and starts,
==114==Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
==115==Then lays his finger on his temple; straight
==116==Springs out into fast gait, then stops again,
==117==Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts
==118==His eye against the moon. In most strange postures
==119==We have seen him set himself.

**KING.**
==119==                It may well be,
==120==There is a mutiny in ’s mind. This morning
==121==Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
==122==As I requir’d; and wot you what I found
==123==There (on my conscience, put unwittingly)?
==124==Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing
==125==The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
==126==Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household, which
==127==I find at such proud rate, that it outspeaks
==128==Possession of a subject.

**NOR.**
==128==              It’s heaven’s will!
==129==Some spirit put this paper in the packet,
==130==To bless your eye withal.

**KING.**
==130==              If we did think
==131==His contemplation were above the earth,
==132==And fix’d on spiritual object, he should still
==133==Dwell in his musings, but I am afraid
==134==His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
==135==His serious considering.

*King takes his seat; whispers Lovell, who goes to the Cardinal.*

**WOL.**
==135==              Heaven forgive me!
==136==Ever God bless your Highness!

**KING.**
==136==                  Good my lord,
==137==You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
==138==Of your best graces in your mind; the which
==139==You were now running o’er. You have scarce time
==140==To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
==141==To keep your earthly audit; sure in that
==142==I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
==143==To have you therein my companion.

**WOL.**
==143==                     Sir,
==144==For holy offices I have a time; a time
==145==To think upon the part of business which
==146==I bear i’ th’ state; and Nature does require
==147==Her times of preservation, which perforce
==148==I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
==149==Must give my tendance to.

**KING.**
==149==              You have said well.

**WOL.**
==150==And ever may your Highness yoke together
==151==(As I will lend you cause) my doing well
==152==With my well saying!

**KING.**
==152==           ’Tis well said again,
==153==And ’tis a kind of good deed to say well,
==154==And yet words are no deeds. My father lov’d you,
==155==He said he did, and with his deed did crown
==156==His word upon you. Since I had my office,
==157==I have kept you next my heart, have not alone
==158==Employ’d you where high profits might come home,
==159==But par’d my present havings, to bestow
==160==My bounties upon you.

**WOL.**
*(Aside.)*
==160==              What should this mean?

**SUR.**
*(Aside.)*
==161==The Lord increase this business!

**KING.**
==161==                Have I not made you
==162==The prime man of the state? I pray you tell me,
==163==If what I now pronounce you have found true;
==164==And if you may confess it, say withal
==165==If you are bound to us, or no. What say you?

**WOL.**
==166==My sovereign, I confess your royal graces
==167==Show’r’d on me daily have been more than could
==168==My studied purposes requite, which went
==169==Beyond all man’s endeavors. My endeavors
==170==Have ever come too short of my desires,
==171==Yet fill’d with my abilities. Mine own ends
==172==Have been mine so, that evermore they pointed
==173==To th’ good of your most sacred person and
==174==The profit of the state. For your great graces
==175==Heap’d upon me, poor undeserver, I
==176==Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,
==177==My pray’rs to heaven for you, my loyalty,
==178==Which ever has and ever shall be growing,
==179==Till death, that winter, kill it.

**KING.**
==179==                Fairly answer’d.
==180==A loyal and obedient subject is
==181==Therein illustrated; the honor of it
==182==Does pay the act of it, as i’ th’ contrary
==183==The foulness is the punishment. I presume
==184==That, as my hand has open’d bounty to you,
==185==My heart dropp’d love, my pow’r rain’d honor, more
==186==On you than any, so your hand and heart,
==187==Your brain, and every function of your power,
==188==Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
==189==As ’twere in love’s particular, be more
==190==To me, your friend, than any.

**WOL.**
==190==                I do profess
==191==That for your Highness’ good I ever labor’d
==192==More than mine own; that am, have, and will be
==193==(Though all the world should crack their duty to you
==194==And throw it from their soul, though perils did
==195==Abound, as thick as thought could make ’em, and
==196==Appear in forms more horrid), yet my duty,
==197==As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
==198==Should the approach of this wild river break,
==199==And stand unshaken yours.

**KING.**
==199==              ’Tis nobly spoken.
==200==Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
==201==For you have seen him open’t. Read o’er this,
*(Giving him papers.)*
==202==And after, this, and then to breakfast with
==203==What appetite you have.

*Exit King, frowning upon the Cardinal; the Nobles throng after him, smiling and whispering.*

**WOL.**
==203==              What should this mean?
==204==What sudden anger’s this? How have I reap’d it?
==205==He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
==206==Leap’d from his eyes. So looks the chafed lion
==207==Upon the daring huntsman that has gall’d him;
==208==Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
==209==I fear, the story of his anger. ’Tis so!
==210==This paper has undone me. ’Tis th’ accompt
==211==Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
==212==For mine own ends (indeed to gain the popedom
==213==And fee my friends in Rome). O negligence!
==214==Fit for a fool to fall by. What cross devil
==215==Made me put this main secret in the packet
==216==I sent the King? Is there no way to cure this?
==217==No new device to beat this from his brains?
==218==I know ’twill stir him strongly; yet I know
==219==A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
==220==Will bring me off again. What’s this? “To th’ Pope”?
==221==The letter, as I live, with all the business
==222==I writ to ’s Holiness. Nay then, farewell!
==223==I have touch’d the highest point of all my greatness,
==224==And, from that full meridian of my glory,
==225==I haste now to my setting. I shall fall
==226==Like a bright exhalation in the evening,
==227==And no man see me more.

*Enter to Wolsey the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the Earl of Surrey, and the Lord Chamberlain.*

**NOR.**
==228==Hear the King’s pleasure, Cardinal, who commands you
==229==To render up the great seal presently
==230==Into our hands, and to confine yourself
==231==To Asher-house, my Lord of Winchester’s,
==232==Till you hear further from his Highness.

**WOL.**
==232==                     Stay!
==233==Where’s your commission, lords? Words cannot carry
==234==Authority so weighty.

**SUF.**
==234==           Who dare cross ’em,
==235==Bearing the King’s will from his mouth expressly?

**WOL.**
==236==Till I find more than will or words to do it
==237==(I mean your malice), know, officious lords,
==238==I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
==239==Of what coarse metal ye are molded, envy,
==240==How eagerly ye follow my disgraces
==241==As if it fed ye, and how sleek and wanton
==242==Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
==243==Follow your envious courses, men of malice!
==244==You have Christian warrant for ’em, and no doubt
==245==In time will find their fit rewards. That seal
==246==You ask with such a violence, the King
==247==(Mine and your master) with his own hand gave me;
==248==Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honors,
==249==During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,
==250==Tied it by letters-patents. Now, who’ll take it?

**SUR.**
==251==The King, that gave it.

**WOL.**
==251==              It must be himself then.

**SUR.**
==252==Thou art a proud traitor, priest.

**WOL.**
==252==                Proud lord, thou liest!
==253==Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
==254==Have burnt that tongue than said so.

**SUR.**
==254==                  Thy ambition,
==255==Thou scarlet sin, robb’d this bewailing land
==256==Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law;
==257==The heads of all thy brother cardinals
==258==(With thee and all thy best parts bound together) 
==259==Weigh’d not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
==260==You sent me deputy for Ireland,
==261==Far from his succor, from the King, from all
==262==That might have mercy on the fault thou gav’st him;
==263==Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
==264==Absolv’d him with an axe.

**WOL.**
==264==              This, and all else
==265==This talking lord can lay upon my credit,
==266==I answer is most false. The Duke by law
==267==Found his deserts. How innocent I was
==268==From any private malice in his end,
==269==His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
==270==If I lov’d many words, lord, I should tell you
==271==You have as little honesty as honor,
==272==That in the way of loyalty and truth
==273==Toward the King, my ever royal master,
==274==Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,
==275==And all that love his follies.

**SUR.**
==275==                By my soul,
==276==Your long coat, priest, protects you, thou shouldst feel
==277==My sword i’ th’ life-blood of thee else. My lords,
==278==Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
==279==And from this fellow? If we live thus tamely,
==280==To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,
==281==Farewell nobility! Let his Grace go forward,
==282==And dare us with his cap, like larks.

**WOL.**
==282==                  All goodness
==283==Is poison to thy stomach.

**SUR.**
==283==              Yes, that goodness
==284==Of gleaning all the land’s wealth into one,
==285==Into your own hands, Card’nal, by extortion;
==286==The goodness of your intercepted packets
==287==You writ to th’ Pope against the King. Your goodness,
==288==Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.
==289==My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
==290==As you respect the common good, the state
==291==Of our despis’d nobility, our issues
==292==(Whom, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen),
==293==Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
==294==Collected from his life. I’ll startle you
==295==Worse than the sacring bell, when the brown wench
==296==Lay kissing in your arms, Lord Cardinal.

**WOL.**
==297==How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
==298==But that I am bound in charity against it!

**NOR.**
==299==Those articles, my lord, are in the King’s hand:
==300==But thus much, they are foul ones.

**WOL.**
==300==                  So much fairer
==301==And spotless shall mine innocence arise
==302==When the King knows my truth.

**SUR.**
==302==                This cannot save you.
==303==I thank my memory, I yet remember
==304==Some of these articles, and out they shall.
==305==Now, if you can blush, and cry “Guilty,” Cardinal,
==306==You’ll show a little honesty.

**WOL.**
==306==                Speak on, sir,
==307==I dare your worst objections. If I blush,
==308==It is to see a nobleman want manners.

**SUR.**
==309==I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
==310==First, that without the King’s assent or knowledge,
==311==You wrought to be a legate, by which power
==312==You maim’d the jurisdiction of all bishops.

**NOR.**
==313==Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
==314==To foreign princes, “*Ego et Rex meus*”
==315==Was still inscrib’d; in which you brought the King
==316==To be your servant.

**SUF.**
==316==           Then, that without the knowledge
==317==Either of King or Council, when you went
==318==Ambassador to the Emperor, you made bold
==319==To carry into Flanders the great seal.

**SUR.**
==320==Item, you sent a large commission
==321==To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,
==322==Without the King’s will or the state’s allowance,
==323==A league between his Highness and Ferrara.

**SUF.**
==324==That out of mere ambition, you have caus’d
==325==Your holy hat to be stamp’d on the King’s coin.

**SUR.**
==326==Then, that you have sent innumerable substance
==327==(By what means got, I leave to your own conscience) 
==328==To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways
==329==You have for dignities, to the mere undoing
==330==Of all the kingdom. Many more there are,
==331==Which since they are of you, and odious,
==332==I will not taint my mouth with.

**CHAM.**
==332==                  O my lord,
==333==Press not a falling man too far! ’Tis virtue.
==334==His faults lie open to the laws, let them,
==335==Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
==336==So little of his great self.

**SUR.**
==336==              I forgive him.

**SUF.**
==337==Lord Cardinal, the King’s further pleasure is⁠—
==338==Because all those things you have done of late
==339==By your power legative within this kingdom
==340==Fall into th’ compass of a *praemunire*⁠—
==341==That therefore such a writ be sued against you,
==342==To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
==343==Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
==344==Out of the King’s protection. This is my charge.

**NOR.**
==345==And so we’ll leave you to your meditations
==346==How to live better. For your stubborn answer
==347==About the giving back the great seal to us,
==348==The King shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
==349==So fare you well, my little good Lord Cardinal.

*Exeunt all but Wolsey.*

**WOL.**
==350==So farewell—to the little good you bear me.
==351==Farewell? A long farewell to all my greatness!
==352==This is the state of man: today he puts forth
==353==The tender leaves of hopes, tomorrow blossoms,
==354==And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;
==355==The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
==356==And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
==357==His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
==358==And then he falls as I do. I have ventur’d,
==359==Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
==360==This many summers in a sea of glory,
==361==But far beyond my depth. My high-blown pride
==362==At length broke under me, and now has left me,
==363==Weary and old with service, to the mercy
==364==Of a rude stream that must forever hide me.
==365==Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye!
==366==I feel my heart new open’d. O how wretched
==367==Is that poor man that hangs on princes’ favors!
==368==There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
==369==That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
==370==More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
==371==And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
==372==Never to hope again.
*(Enter Cromwell, standing amazed.)*
==372==           Why, how now, Cromwell?

**CROM.**
==373==I have no power to speak, sir.

**WOL.**
==373==                What, amaz’d
==374==At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder
==375==A great man should decline? Nay, and you weep
==376==I am fall’n indeed.

**CROM.**
==376==        How does your Grace?

**WOL.**
==376==                       Why, well;
==377==Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell;
==378==I know myself now, and I feel within me
==379==A peace above all earthly dignities,
==380==A still and quiet conscience. The King has cur’d me,
==381==I humbly thank his Grace; and from these shoulders,
==382==These ruin’d pillars, out of pity taken
==383==A load would sink a navy—too much honor.
==384==O, ’tis a burden, Cromwell, ’tis a burden
==385==Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!

**CROM.**
==386==I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it.

**WOL.**
==387==I hope I have. I am able now, methinks
==388==(Out of a fortitude of soul I feel),
==389==To endure more miseries and greater far
==390==Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
==391==What news abroad?

**CROM.**
==391==           The heaviest and the worst
==392==Is your displeasure with the King.

**WOL.**
==392==                  God bless him!

**CROM.**
==393==The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen
==394==Lord Chancellor in your place.

**WOL.**
==394==                That’s somewhat sudden;
==395==But he’s a learned man. May he continue
==396==Long in his Highness’ favor, and do justice
==397==For truth’s sake and his conscience, that his bones,
==398==When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,
==399==May have a tomb of orphants’ tears wept on him!
==400==What more?

**CROM.**
==400==        That Cranmer is return’d with welcome,
==401==Install’d Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.

**WOL.**
==402==That’s news indeed.

**CROM.**
==402==           Last, that the Lady Anne,
==403==Whom the King hath in secrecy long married,
==404==This day was view’d in open as his queen,
==405==Going to chapel; and the voice is now
==406==Only about her coronation.

**WOL.**
==407==There was the weight that pull’d me down. O Cromwell,
==408==The King has gone beyond me! All my glories
==409==In that one woman I have lost forever.
==410==No sun shall ever usher forth mine honors,
==411==Or gild again the noble troops that waited
==412==Upon my smiles. Go get thee from me, Cromwell!
==413==I am a poor fall’n man, unworthy now
==414==To be thy lord and master. Seek the King!
==415==That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
==416==What, and how true, thou art; he will advance thee.
==417==Some little memory of me will stir him
==418==(I know his noble nature) not to let
==419==Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,
==420==Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
==421==For thine own future safety.

**CROM.**
==421==                O my lord,
==422==Must I then leave you? Must I needs forgo
==423==So good, so noble, and so true a master?
==424==Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
==425==With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
==426==The King shall have my service; but my pray’rs
==427==Forever and forever shall be yours.

**WOL.**
==428==Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
==429==In all my miseries; but thou hast forc’d me
==430==(Out of thy honest truth) to play the woman.
==431==Let’s dry our eyes; and thus far hear me, Cromwell,
==432==And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
==433==And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention
==434==Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee;
==435==Say Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
==436==And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor,
==437==Found thee a way, out of his wrack, to rise in;
==438==A sure and safe one, though thy master miss’d it.
==439==Mark but my fall, and that that ruin’d me:
==440==Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition!
==441==By that sin fell the angels; how can man then
==442==(The image of his Maker) hope to win by it?
==443==Love thyself last, cherish those hearts that hate thee;
==444==Corruption wins not more than honesty.
==445==Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
==446==To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not;
==447==Let all the ends thou aim’st at be thy country’s,
==448==Thy God’s, and truth’s; then if thou fall’st, O Cromwell,
==449==Thou fall’st a blessed martyr!
==450==Serve the King, and—prithee lead me in.
==451==There take an inventory of all I have,
==452==To the last penny, ’tis the King’s. My robe,
==453==And my integrity to heaven, is all
==454==I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell,
==455==Had I but serv’d my God with half the zeal
==456==I serv’d my king, He would not in mine age
==457==Have left me naked to mine enemies.

**CROM.**
==458==Good sir, have patience.

**WOL.**
==458==              So I have. Farewell
==459==The hopes of court! My hopes in heaven do dwell.

*Exeunt.*
