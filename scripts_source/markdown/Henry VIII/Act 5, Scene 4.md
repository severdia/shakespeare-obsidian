## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[ị Epilogue|Epilogue →]]

*The palace-yard.*

*Enter trumpets, sounding; then two Aldermen, Lord Mayor, Garter, Cranmer, Duke of Norfolk with his marshal’s staff, Duke of Suffolk, two Gentlemen bearing great standing-bowls for the christening gifts; then four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the Duchess of Norfolk, godmother, bearing the child richly habited in a mantle, etc., train borne by a Lady; then follows the Marchioness Dorset, the other godmother, and Ladies.*

*The troop pass once about the stage, and Garter speaks.*

**GART.**
==1== Heaven, from thy endless goodness send prosperous life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty Princess of England, Elizabeth!

*Flourish. Enter King and Guard.*

**CRAN.**
*(Kneeling.)*
==2== And to your royal Grace and the good Queen,
==3== My noble partners and myself thus pray
==4== All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady
==5== Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy
==6== May hourly fall upon ye!

**KING.**
==6==               Thank you, good Lord Archbishop.
==7== What is her name?

**CRAN.**
==7==            Elizabeth.

**KING.**
==7==                   Stand up, lord.
*(The King kisses the child.)*
==8== With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!
==9== Into whose hand I give thy life.

**CRAN.**
==9==                   Amen.

**KING.**
==10== My noble gossips, y’ have been too prodigal.
==11== I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,
==12== When she has so much English.

**CRAN.**
==12==                   Let me speak, sir,
==13== For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
==14== Let none think flattery, for they’ll find ’em truth.
==15== This royal infant—heaven still move about her!⁠—
==16== Though in her cradle, yet now promises
==17== Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
==18== Which time shall bring to ripeness. She shall be
==19== (But few now living can behold that goodness) 
==20== A pattern to all princes living with her,
==21== And all that shall succeed. Saba was never
==22== More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
==23== Than this pure soul shall be. All princely graces
==24== That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
==25== With all the virtues that attend the good,
==26== Shall still be doubled on her. Truth shall nurse her,
==27== Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her.
==28== She shall be lov’d and fear’d: her own shall bless her;
==29== Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
==30== And hang their heads with sorrow. Good grows with her;
==31== In her days every man shall eat in safety
==32== Under his own vine what he plants, and sing
==33== The merry songs of peace to all his neighbors.
==34== God shall be truly known, and those about her
==35== From her shall read the perfect ways of honor,
==36== And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
==37== Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when
==38== The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
==39== Her ashes new create another heir
==40== As great in admiration as herself,
==41== So shall she leave her blessedness to one
==42== (When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness) 
==43== Who from the sacred ashes of her honor
==44== Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,
==45== And so stand fix’d. Peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
==46== That were the servants to this chosen infant,
==47== Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him.
==48== Where ever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
==49== His honor and the greatness of his name
==50== Shall be, and make new nations. He shall flourish,
==51== And like a mountain cedar reach his branches
==52== To all the plains about him. Our children’s children
==53== Shall see this, and bless heaven.

**KING.**
==53==                   Thou speakest wonders.

**CRAN.**
==54== She shall be, to the happiness of England,
==55== An aged princess; many days shall see her,
==56== And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
==57== Would I had known no more! But she must die,
==58== She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
==59== A most unspotted lily shall she pass
==60== To th’ ground, and all the world shall mourn her.

**KING.**
==61== O Lord Archbishop,
==62== Thou hast made me now a man! Never, before
==63== This happy child, did I get any thing.
==64== This oracle of comfort has so pleas’d me
==65== That when I am in heaven I shall desire
==66== To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
==67== I thank ye all. To you, my good Lord Mayor,
==68== And you, good brethren, I am much beholding;
==69== I have receiv’d much honor by your presence,
==70== And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords,
==71== Ye must all see the Queen, and she must thank ye,
==72== She will be sick else. This day, no man think
==73== H’as business at his house; for all shall stay:
==74== This little one shall make it Holy-day.

*Exeunt.*
