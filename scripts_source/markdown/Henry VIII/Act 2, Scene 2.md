## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*London. An ante-chamber in the palace.*

*Enter Lord Chamberlain reading this letter.*

**CHAM.**
==1== *“My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and furnish’d. They were young and handsome, and of the best breed in the north. When they were ready to set out for London, a man of my Lord Cardinal’s, by commission and main power, took ’em from me, with this reason: his master would be serv’d before a subject, if not before the King, which stopp’d our mouths, sir.”*
==2== I fear he will indeed. Well, let him have them:
==3== He will have all, I think.

*Enter to the Lord Chamberlain the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk.*

**NOR.**
==4== Well met, my Lord Chamberlain.

**CHAM.**
==5== Good day to both your Graces.

**SUF.**
==6== How is the King employ’d?

**CHAM.**
==6==               I left him private,
==7== Full of sad thoughts and troubles.

**NOR.**
==7==                   What’s the cause?

**CHAM.**
==8== It seems the marriage with his brother’s wife
==9== Has crept too near his conscience.

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==9==                   No, his conscience
==10== Has crept too near another lady.

**NOR.**
==10==                   ’Tis so;
==11== This is the Cardinal’s doing. The king-cardinal,
==12== That blind priest, like the eldest son of Fortune,
==13== Turns what he list. The King will know him one day.

**SUF.**
==14== Pray God he do, he’ll never know himself else.

**NOR.**
==15== How holily he works in all his business!
==16== And with what zeal! For now he has crack’d the league
==17== Between us and the Emperor (the Queen’s great nephew),
==18== He dives into the King’s soul, and there scatters
==19== Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,
==20== Fears, and despairs, and all these for his marriage.
==21== And out of all these to restore the King,
==22== He counsels a divorce, a loss of her
==23== That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years
==24== About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;
==25== Of her that loves him with that excellence
==26== That angels love good men with; even of her
==27== That when the greatest stroke of fortune falls
==28== Will bless the King. And is not this course pious?

**CHAM.**
==29== Heaven keep me from such counsel! ’Tis most true
==30== These news are every where; every tongue speaks ’em,
==31== And every true heart weeps for’t. All that dare
==32== Look into these affairs see this main end,
==33== The French king’s sister. Heaven will one day open
==34== The King’s eyes, that so long have slept upon
==35== This bold bad man.

**SUF.**
==35==            And free us from his slavery.

**NOR.**
==36== We had need pray,
==37== And heartily, for our deliverance,
==38== Or this imperious man will work us all
==39== From princes into pages. All men’s honors
==40== Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion’d
==41== Into what pitch he please.

**SUF.**
==41==               For me, my lords,
==42== I love him not, nor fear him; there’s my creed.
==43== As I am made without him, so I’ll stand,
==44== If the King please; his curses and his blessings
==45== Touch me alike; th’ are breath I not believe in.
==46== I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him
==47== To him that made him proud, the Pope.

**NOR.**
==47==                      Let’s in;
==48== And with some other business put the King
==49== From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him.
==50== My lord, you’ll bear us company?

**CHAM.**
==50==                   Excuse me,
==51== The King has sent me otherwhere. Besides,
==52== You’ll find a most unfit time to disturb him.
==53== Health to your lordships.

**NOR.**
==53==               Thanks, my good Lord Chamberlain.

*Exit Lord Chamberlain.*

*The King draws the curtain and sits reading pensively.*

**SUF.**
==54== How sad he looks! Sure he is much afflicted.

**KING.**
==55== Who’s there? Ha?

**NOR.**
==55==            Pray God he be not angry.

**KING.**
==56== Who’s there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves
==57== Into my private meditations?
==58== Who am I? Ha?

**NOR.**
==59== A gracious king that pardons all offenses
==60== Malice ne’er meant. Our breach of duty this way
==61== Is business of estate; in which we come
==62== To know your royal pleasure.

**KING.**
==62==                 Ye are too bold.
==63== Go to; I’ll make ye know your times of business.
==64== Is this an hour for temporal affairs? Ha?
*(Enter Wolsey and Campeius with a commission.)*
==65== Who’s there? My good Lord Cardinal? O my Wolsey,
==66== The quiet of my wounded conscience,
==67== Thou art a cure fit for a king.
*(To Campeius.)*
==67==                 You’re welcome,
==68== Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom,
==69== Use us and it.
*(To Wolsey.)*
==69==         My good lord, have great care
==70== I be not found a talker.

**WOL.**
==70==               Sir, you cannot.
==71== I would your Grace would give us but an hour
==72== Of private conference.

**KING.**
*(To Norfolk and Suffolk.)*
==72==               We are busy; go.

**NOR.**
*(Aside to Suffolk)*
==73== This priest has no pride in him?

**SUF.**
*(Aside to Norfolk)*
==73==                   Not to speak of.
==74== I would not be so sick though for his place.
==75== But this cannot continue.

**NOR.**
*(Aside to Suffolk)*
==75==               If it do,
==76== I’ll venture one; have at him!

**SUF.**
*(Aside to Norfolk)*
==76==                 I another.

*Exeunt Norfolk and Suffolk.*

**WOL.**
==77== Your Grace has given a president of wisdom
==78== Above all princes, in committing freely
==79== Your scruple to the voice of Christendom.
==80== Who can be angry now? What envy reach you?
==81== The Spaniard, tied by blood and favor to her,
==82== Must now confess, if they have any goodness,
==83== The trial just and noble. All the clerks
==84== (I mean the learned ones in Christian kingdoms) 
==85== Have their free voices. Rome, the nurse of judgment,
==86== Invited by your noble self, hath sent
==87== One general tongue unto us: this good man,
==88== This just and learned priest, Card’nal Campeius,
==89== Whom once more I present unto your Highness.

**KING.**
==90== And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,
==91== And thank the holy conclave for their loves;
==92== They have sent me such a man I would have wish’d for.

**CAM.**
==93== Your Grace must needs deserve all strangers’ loves,
==94== You are so noble. To your Highness’ hand
==95== I tender my commission; by whose virtue,
==96== The court of Rome commanding, you, my Lord
==97== Cardinal of York, are join’d with me their servant
==98== In the unpartial judging of this business.

**KING.**
==99== Two equal men. The Queen shall be acquainted
==100== Forthwith for what you come. Where’s Gardiner?

**WOL.**
==101== I know your Majesty has always lov’d her
==102== So dear in heart not to deny her that
==103== A woman of less place might ask by law:
==104== Scholars allow’d freely to argue for her.

**KING.**
==105== Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favor
==106== To him that does best, God forbid else. Cardinal,
==107== Prithee call Gardiner to me, my new secretary.
==108== I find him a fit fellow.

*Exit Wolsey.*

*Enter Wolsey with Gardiner.*

**WOL.**
*(Aside to Gardiner)*
==109== Give me your hand. Much joy and favor to you;
==110== You are the King’s now.

**GARD.**
*(Aside to Wolsey)*
==110==               But to be commanded
==111== Forever by your Grace, whose hand has rais’d me.

**KING.**
==112== Come hither, Gardiner.

*Walks and whispers.*

**CAM.**
==113== My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace
==114== In this man’s place before him?

**WOL.**
==114==                   Yes, he was.

**CAM.**
==115== Was he not held a learned man?

**WOL.**
==115==                   Yes, surely.

**CAM.**
==116== Believe me, there’s an ill opinion spread then,
==117== Even of yourself, Lord Cardinal.

**WOL.**
==117==                   How? Of me?

**CAM.**
==118== They will not stick to say you envied him,
==119== And fearing he would rise (he was so virtuous),
==120== Kept him a foreign man still, which so griev’d him,
==121== That he ran mad, and died.

**WOL.**
==121==               Heav’n’s peace be with him!
==122== That’s Christian care enough. For living murmurers
==123== There’s places of rebuke. He was a fool⁠—
==124== For he would needs be virtuous. That good fellow,
==125== If I command him, follows my appointment;
==126== I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,
==127== We live not to be grip’d by meaner persons.

**KING.**
==128== Deliver this with modesty to th’ Queen.
*(Exit Gardiner.)*
==129== The most convenient place that I can think of
==130== For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;
==131== There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
==132== My Wolsey, see it furnish’d. O my lord,
==133== Would it not grieve an able man to leave
==134== So sweet a bedfellow? But conscience, conscience!
==135== O, ’tis a tender place, and I must leave her.

*Exeunt.*
