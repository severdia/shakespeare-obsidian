## Epilogue
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]]

**EPILOGUE**
==1==’Tis ten to one this play can never please
==2==All that are here. Some come to take their ease,
==3==And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear
==4==W’ have frighted with our trumpets; so ’tis clear,
==5==They’ll say ’tis naught; others to hear the city
==6==Abus’d extremely, and to cry, “That’s witty!”
==7==Which we have not done neither: that I fear
==8==All the expected good w’ are like to hear
==9==For this play at this time, is only in
==10==The merciful construction of good women,
==11==For such a one we show’d ’em. If they smile,
==12==And say ’twill do, I know within a while
==13==All the best men are ours; for ’tis ill hap
==14==If they hold when their ladies bid ’em clap.
