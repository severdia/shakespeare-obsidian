## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*A public place.*

*Enter Antipholus Erotes of Syracuse.*

**S. ANT.**
==1== The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
==2== Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave
==3== Is wand’red forth, in care to seek me out.
==4== By computation and mine host’s report,
==5== I could not speak with Dromio since at first
==6== I sent him from the mart! See, here he comes.
*(Enter Dromio of Syracuse.)*
==7== How now, sir, is your merry humor alter’d?
==8== As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
==9== You know no Centaur? You receiv’d no gold?
==10== Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
==11== My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
==12== That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

**S. DRO.**
==13== What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?

**S. ANT.**
==14== Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

**S. DRO.**
==15== I did not see you since you sent me hence
==16== Home to the Centaur with the gold you gave me.

**S. ANT.**
==17== Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt,
==18== And toldst me of a mistress, and a dinner,
==19== For which I hope thou feltst I was displeas’d.

**S. DRO.**
==20== I am glad to see you in this merry vein.
==21== What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.

**S. ANT.**
==22== Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
==23== Think’st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

*Beats Dromio.*

**S. DRO.**
==24== Hold, sir, for God’s sake! Now your jest is earnest,
==25== Upon what bargain do you give it me?

**S. ANT.**
==26== Because that I familiarly sometimes
==27== Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,
==28== Your sauciness will jest upon my love,
==29== And make a common of my serious hours.
==30== When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport,
==31== But creep in crannies, when he hides his beams:
==32== If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
==33== And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
==34== Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

**S. DRO.**
==35== Sconce call you it? So you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head. And you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and ensconce it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?

**S. ANT.**
==36== Dost thou not know?

**S. DRO.**
==37== Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.

**S. ANT.**
==38== Shall I tell you why?

**S. DRO.**
==39== Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say, every why hath a wherefore.

**S. ANT.**
==40== Why first—for flouting me, and then wherefore⁠—
==41== For urging it the second time to me.

**S. DRO.**
==42== Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
==43== When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?
==44== Well, sir, I thank you.

**S. ANT.**
==45== Thank me, sir, for what?

**S. DRO.**
==46== Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.

**S. ANT.**
==47== I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?

**S. DRO.**
==48== No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have.

**S. ANT.**
==49== In good time, sir: what’s that?

**S. DRO.**
==50== Basting.

**S. ANT.**
==51== Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.

**S. DRO.**
==52== If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.

**S. ANT.**
==53== Your reason?

**S. DRO.**
==54== Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting.

**S. ANT.**
==55== Well, sir, learn to jest in good time—there’s a time for all things.

**S. DRO.**
==56== I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.

**S. ANT.**
==57== By what rule, sir?

**S. DRO.**
==58== Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.

**S. ANT.**
==59== Let’s hear it.

**S. DRO.**
==60== There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.

**S. ANT.**
==61== May he not do it by fine and recovery?

**S. DRO.**
==62== Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.

**S. ANT.**
==63== Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being (as it is) so plentiful an excrement?

**S. DRO.**
==64== Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.

**S. ANT.**
==65== Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.

**S. DRO.**
==66== Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.

**S. ANT.**
==67== Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.

**S. DRO.**
==68== The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.

**S. ANT.**
==69== For what reason?

**S. DRO.**
==70== For two—and sound ones too.

**S. ANT.**
==71== Nay, not sound, I pray you.

**S. DRO.**
==72== Sure ones then.

**S. ANT.**
==73== Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

**S. DRO.**
==74== Certain ones then.

**S. ANT.**
==75== Name them.

**S. DRO.**
==76== The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.

**S. ANT.**
==77== You would all this time have prov’d there is no time for all things.

**S. DRO.**
==78== Marry, and did, sir: namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature.

**S. ANT.**
==79== But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.

**S. DRO.**
==80== Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world’s end, will have bald followers.

**S. ANT.**
==81== I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion. But soft, who wafts us yonder?

*Enter Adriana and Luciana.*

**ADR.**
==82== Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown,
==83== Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects:
==84== I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.
==85== The time was once, when thou unurg’d wouldst vow
==86== That never words were music to thine ear,
==87== That never object pleasing in thine eye,
==88== That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
==89== That never meat sweet-savor’d in thy taste,
==90== Unless I spake, or look’d, or touch’d, or carv’d to thee.
==91== How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
==92== That thou art then estranged from thyself?
==93== Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
==94== That, undividable incorporate,
==95== Am better than thy dear self’s better part.
==96== Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;
==97== For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall
==98== A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
==99== And take unmingled thence that drop again,
==100== Without addition or diminishing,
==101== As take from me thyself and not me too.
==102== How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,
==103== Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious,
==104== And that this body, consecrate to thee,
==105== By ruffian lust should be contaminate?
==106== Wouldst thou not spit at me, and spurn at me,
==107== And hurl the name of husband in my face,
==108== And tear the stain’d skin off my harlot brow,
==109== And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,
==110== And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
==111== I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.
==112== I am possess’d with an adulterate blot;
==113== My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
==114== For if we two be one, and thou play false,
==115== I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
==116== Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
==117== Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed,
==118== I live dis-stain’d, thou undishonored.

**S. ANT.**
==119== Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
==120== In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
==121== As strange unto your town as to your talk,
==122== Who, every word by all my wit being scann’d,
==123== Wants wit in all one word to understand.

**LUC.**
==124== Fie, brother, how the world is chang’d with you:
==125== When were you wont to use my sister thus?
==126== She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.

**S. ANT.**
==127== By Dromio?

**S. DRO.**
==128== By me?

**ADR.**
==129== By thee, and this thou didst return from him,
==130== That he did buffet thee, and in his blows
==131== Denied my house for his, me for his wife.

**S. ANT.**
==132== Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
==133== What is the course and drift of your compact?

**S. DRO.**
==134== I, sir? I never saw her till this time.

**S. ANT.**
==135== Villain, thou liest, for even her very words
==136== Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

**S. DRO.**
==137== I never spake with her in all my life.

**S. ANT.**
==138== How can she thus then call us by our names,
==139== Unless it be by inspiration?

**ADR.**
==140== How ill agrees it with your gravity
==141== To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
==142== Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
==143== Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
==144== But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
==145== Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
==146== Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
==147== Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
==148== Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
==149== If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
==150== Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss,
==151== Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
==152== Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.

**S. ANT.**
==153== To me she speaks, she moves me for her theme:
==154== What, was I married to her in my dream?
==155== Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
==156== What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
==157== Until I know this sure uncertainty,
==158== I’ll entertain the offer’d fallacy.

**LUC.**
==159== Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

**S. DRO.**
==160== O for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
==161== This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!
==162== We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites;
==163== If we obey them not, this will ensue:
==164== they’ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

**LUC.**
==165== Why prat’st thou to thyself, and answer’st not?
==166== Dromio, thou drumble, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

**S. DRO.**
==167== I am transformed, master, am not I?

**S. ANT.**
==168== I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

**S. DRO.**
==169== Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.

**S. ANT.**
==170== Thou hast thine own form.

**S. DRO.**
==170==               No, I am an ape.

**LUC.**
==171== If thou art chang’d to aught, ’tis to an ass.

**S. DRO.**
==172== ’Tis true she rides me and I long for grass.
==173== ’Tis so, I am an ass, else it could never be
==174== But I should know her as well as she knows me.

**ADR.**
==175== Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
==176== To put the finger in the eye and weep,
==177== Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.
==178== Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
==179== Husband, I’ll dine above with you today,
==180== And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
==181== Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
==182== Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
==183== Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

**S. ANT.**
==184== Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
==185== Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis’d?
==186== Known unto these, and to myself disguis’d?
==187== I’ll say as they say, and persever so,
==188== And in this mist at all adventures go.

**S. DRO.**
==189== Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

**ADR.**
==190== Ay, and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

**LUC.**
==191== Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

*Exeunt.*
