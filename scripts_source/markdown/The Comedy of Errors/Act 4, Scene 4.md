## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*A street.*

*Enter Antipholus of Ephesus with the Officer.*

**E. ANT.**
==1==Fear me not, man, I will not break away;
==2==I’ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
==3==To warrant thee, as I am ’rested for.
==4==My wife is in a wayward mood today,
==5==And will not lightly trust the messenger,
==6==That I should be attach’d in Ephesus;
==7==I tell you, ’twill sound harshly in her ears.
*(Enter Dromio of Ephesus with a rope’s end.)*
==8==Here comes my man: I think he brings the money.
==9==How now, sir? Have you that I sent you for?

**E. DRO.**
==10==Here’s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.

**E. ANT.**
==11==But where’s the money?

**E. DRO.**
==12==Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.

**E. ANT.**
==13==Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?

**E. DRO.**
==14==I’ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.

**E. ANT.**
==15==To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?

**E. DRO.**
==16==To a rope’s end, sir, and to that end am I return’d.

**E. ANT.**
==17==And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

*Beats Dromio.*

**OFF.**
==18==Good sir, be patient.

**E. DRO.**
==19==Nay, ’tis for me to be patient: I am in adversity.

**OFF.**
==20==Good now, hold thy tongue.

**E. DRO.**
==21==Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.

**E. ANT.**
==22==Thou whoreson, senseless villain!

**E. DRO.**
==23==I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel your blows.

**E. ANT.**
==24==Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.

**E. DRO.**
==25==I am an ass indeed; you may prove it by my long ears. I have serv’d him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me with beating. I am wak’d with it when I sleep, rais’d with it when I sit, driven out of doors with it when I go from home, welcom’d home with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a beggar wont her brat; and I think when he hath lam’d me, I shall beg with it from door to door.

*Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan, and a schoolmaster call’d Pinch.*

**E. ANT.**
==26==Come go along, my wife is coming yonder.

**E. DRO.**
==27==Mistress, *respice finem*, respect your end, or rather, the prophecy like the parrot, “beware the rope’s end.”

**E. ANT.**
==28==Wilt thou still talk?

*Beats Dromio.*

**COUR.**
==29==How say you now? Is not your husband mad?

**ADR.**
==30==His incivility confirms no less.
==31==Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer,
==32==Establish him in his true sense again,
==33==And I will please you what you will demand.

**LUC.**
==34==Alas, how fiery, and how sharp, he looks!

**COUR.**
==35==Mark, how he trembles in his ecstasy!

**PINCH.**
==36==Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.

**E. ANT.**
==37==There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.

*Strikes Pinch.*

**PINCH.**
==38==I charge thee, Satan, hous’d within this man,
==39==To yield possession to my holy prayers,
==40==And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
==41==I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!

**E. ANT.**
==42==Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.

**ADR.**
==43==O that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!

**E. ANT.**
==44==You minion, you, are these your customers?
==45==Did this companion with the saffron face
==46==Revel and feast it at my house today,
==47==Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,
==48==And I denied to enter in my house?

**ADR.**
==49==O husband, God doth know you din’d at home,
==50==Where would you had remain’d until this time,
==51==Free from these slanders and this open shame.

**E. ANT.**
==52==Din’d at home? Thou villain, what sayest thou?

**E. DRO.**
==53==Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.

**E. ANT.**
==54==Were not my doors lock’d up, and I shut out?

**E. DRO.**
==55==Perdie, your doors were lock’d, and you shut out.

**E. ANT.**
==56==And did not she herself revile me there?

**E. DRO.**
==57==Sans fable, she herself revil’d you there.

**E. ANT.**
==58==Did not her kitchen maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?

**E. DRO.**
==59==Certes she did, the kitchen vestal scorn’d you.

**E. ANT.**
==60==And did not I in rage depart from thence?

**E. DRO.**
==61==In verity you did, my bones bears witness,
==62==That since have felt the vigor of his rage.

**ADR.**
==63==Is’t good to soothe him in these contraries?

**PINCH.**
==64==It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,
==65==And yielding to him, humors well his frenzy.

**E. ANT.**
==66==Thou hast suborn’d the goldsmith to arrest me.

**ADR.**
==67==Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
==68==By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

**E. DRO.**
==69==Money by me? Heart and good will you might,
==70==But surely, master, not a rag of money.

**E. ANT.**
==71==Went’st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?

**ADR.**
==72==He came to me, and I deliver’d it.

**LUC.**
==73==And I am witness with her that she did.

**E. DRO.**
==74==God and the rope-maker bear me witness
==75==That I was sent for nothing but a rope!

**PINCH.**
==76==Mistress, both man and master is possess’d:
==77==I know it by their pale and deadly looks.
==78==They must be bound and laid in some dark room.

**E. ANT.**
==79==Say wherefore didst thou lock me forth today?
==80==And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

**ADR.**
==81==I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

**E. DRO.**
==82==And, gentle master, I receiv’d no gold;
==83==But I confess, sir, that we were lock’d out.

**ADR.**
==84==Dissembling villain, thou speak’st false in both.

**E. ANT.**
==85==Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,
==86==And art confederate with a damned pack
==87==To make a loathsome abject scorn of me;
==88==But with these nails I’ll pluck out these false eyes
==89==That would behold in me this shameful sport.

*Enter three or four, and offer to bind him; he strives.*

**ADR.**
==90==O, bind him, bind him, let him not come near me.

**PINCH.**
==91==More company! The fiend is strong within him.

**LUC.**
==92==Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!

**E. ANT.**
==93==What, will you murder me? Thou jailer, thou,
==94==I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them
==95==To make a rescue?

**OFF.**
==95==           Masters, let him go:
==96==He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.

**PINCH.**
==97==Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.

*They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus.*

**ADR.**
==98==What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
==99==Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
==100==Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

**OFF.**
==101==He is my prisoner; if I let him go,
==102==The debt he owes will be requir’d of me.

**ADR.**
==103==I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
==104==Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
==105==And knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
==106==Good Master Doctor, see him safe convey’d
==107==Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

**E. ANT.**
==108==O most unhappy strumpet!

**E. DRO.**
==109==Master, I am here ent’red in bond for you.

**E. ANT.**
==110==Out on thee, villain, wherefore dost thou mad me?

**E. DRO.**
==111==Will you be bound for nothing? Be mad, good master,
==112==Cry “The devil!”

**LUC.**
==113==God help, poor souls, how idlely do they talk!

**ADR.**
==114==Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
*(Exeunt Manent Officer, Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan.)*
==115==Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

**OFF.**
==116==One Angelo, a goldsmith. Do you know him?

**ADR.**
==117==I know the man; what is the sum he owes?

**OFF.**
==118==Two hundred ducats.

**ADR.**
==118==           Say, how grows it due?

**OFF.**
==119==Due for a chain your husband had of him.

**ADR.**
==120==He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

**COUR.**
==121==When as your husband all in rage today
==122==Came to my house, and took away my ring⁠—
==123==The ring I saw upon his finger now⁠—
==124==Straight after did I meet him with a chain.

**ADR.**
==125==It may be so, but I did never see it.
==126==Come, jailer, bring me where the goldsmith is,
==127==I long to know the truth hereof at large.

*Enter Antipholus of Syracuse, with his rapier drawn, and Dromio of Syracuse.*

**LUC.**
==128==God for thy mercy! They are loose again.

**ADR.**
==129==And come with naked swords: let’s call more help
==130==To have them bound again.

**OFF.**
==130==              Away, they’ll kill us.

*Exeunt omnes but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse as fast as may be, frighted.*

**S. ANT.**
==131==I see these witches are afraid of swords.

**S. DRO.**
==132==She that would be your wife now ran from you.

**S. ANT.**
==133==Come to the Centaur, fetch our stuff from thence;
==134==I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

**S. DRO.**
==135==Faith, stay here this night, they will surely do us no harm. You saw they speak us fair, give us gold: methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me, I could find in my heart to stay here still, and turn witch.

**S. ANT.**
==136==I will not stay tonight for all the town:
==137==Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

*Exeunt.*
