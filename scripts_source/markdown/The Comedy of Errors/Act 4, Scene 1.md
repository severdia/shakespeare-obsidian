## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*A public place.*

*Enter Second Merchant, Angelo the goldsmith, and an Officer.*

**2. MER.**
==1==You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
==2==And since I have not much importun’d you,
==3==Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
==4==To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
==5==Therefore make present satisfaction,
==6==Or I’ll attach you by this officer.

**ANG.**
==7==Even just the sum that I do owe to you
==8==Is growing to me by Antipholus,
==9==And in the instant that I met with you
==10==He had of me a chain. At five a’clock
==11==I shall receive the money for the same:
==12==Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
==13==I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.

*Enter Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Ephesus from the Courtesan’s.*

**OFF.**
==14==That labor may you save; see where he comes.

**E. ANT.**
==15==While I go to the goldsmith’s house, go thou
==16==And buy a rope’s end; that will I bestow
==17==Among my wife and her confederates,
==18==For locking me out of my doors by day.
==19==But soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone,
==20==Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.

**E. DRO.**
==21==I buy a thousand pound a year! I buy a rope!

*Exit Dromio.*

**E. ANT.**
==22==A man is well help up that trusts to you:
==23==I promised your presence and the chain,
==24==But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me:
==25==Belike you thought our love would last too long
==26==If it were chain’d together, and therefore came not.

**ANG.**
==27==Saving your merry humor, here’s the note
==28==How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
==29==The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,
==30==Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
==31==Than I stand debted to this gentleman.
==32==I pray you see him presently discharg’d,
==33==For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.

**E. ANT.**
==34==I am not furnish’d with the present money:
==35==Besides, I have some business in the town.
==36==Good *signior*, take the stranger to my house,
==37==And with you take the chain, and bid my wife
==38==Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.
==39==Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

**ANG.**
==40==Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?

**E. ANT.**
==41==No, bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.

**ANG.**
==42==Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?

**E. ANT.**
==43==And if I have not, sir, I hope you have:
==44==Or else you may return without your money.

**ANG.**
==45==Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
==46==Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
==47==And I, to blame, have held him here too long.

**E. ANT.**
==48==Good Lord! You use this dalliance to excuse
==49==Your breach of promise to the Porpentine:
==50==I should have chid you for not bringing it,
==51==But like a shrew you first begin to brawl.

**2. MER.**
==52==The hour steals on, I pray you, sir, dispatch.

**ANG.**
==53==You hear how he importunes me—the chain!

**E. ANT.**
==54==Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your money.

**ANG.**
==55==Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
==56==Either send the chain, or send me by some token.

**E. ANT.**
==57==Fie, now you run this humor out of breath.
==58==Come, where’s the chain? I pray you let me see it.

**2. MER.**
==59==My business cannot brook this dalliance.
==60==Good sir, say whe’r you’ll answer me or no:
==61==If not, I’ll leave him to the officer.

**E. ANT.**
==62==I answer you? What should I answer you?

**ANG.**
==63==The money that you owe me for the chain.

**E. ANT.**
==64==I owe you none, till I receive the chain.

**ANG.**
==65==You know I gave it you half an hour since.

**E. ANT.**
==66==You gave me none, you wrong me much to say so.

**ANG.**
==67==You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.
==68==Consider how it stands upon my credit.

**2. MER.**
==69==Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

**OFF.**
==70==I do, and charge you in the Duke’s name to obey me.

**ANG.**
==71==This touches me in reputation.
==72==Either consent to pay this sum for me
==73==Or I attach you by this officer.

**E. ANT.**
==74==Consent to pay thee that I never had!
==75==Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar’st.

**ANG.**
==76==Here is thy fee, arrest him, officer.
==77==I would not spare my brother in this case,
==78==If he should scorn me so apparently.

**OFF.**
==79==I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.

**E. ANT.**
==80==I do obey thee, till I give thee bail.
==81==But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
==82==As all the metal in your shop will answer.

**ANG.**
==83==Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,
==84==To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.

*Enter Dromio of Syracuse from the bay.*

**S. DRO.**
==85==Master, there’s a bark of Epidamium
==86==That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
==87==And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
==88==I have convey’d aboard, and I have bought
==89==The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitae.
==90==The ship is in her trim, the merry wind
==91==Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
==92==But for their owner, master, and yourself.

**E. ANT.**
==93==How now? A madman? Why, thou peevish sheep,
==94==What ship of Epidamium stays for me?

**S. DRO.**
==95==A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.

**E. ANT.**
==96==Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope,
==97==And told thee to what purpose and what end.

**S. DRO.**
==98==You sent me for a rope’s end as soon:
==99==You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.

**E. ANT.**
==100==I will debate this matter at more leisure,
==101==And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
==102==To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
==103==Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
==104==That’s cover’d o’er with Turkish tapestry
==105==There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.
==106==Tell her I am arrested in the street,
==107==And that shall bail me. Hie thee, slave, be gone!
==108==On, officer, to prison till it come.

*Exeunt all but Dromio of Syracuse.*

**S. DRO.**
==109==To Adriana! That is where we din’d,
==110==Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
==111==She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
==112==Thither I must, although against my will,
==113==For servants must their masters’ minds fulfill.

*Exit.*
