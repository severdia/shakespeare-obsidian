## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*The mart.*

*Enter Antipholus Erotes of Syracuse, First Merchant, and Dromio of Syracuse.*

**1. MER.**
==1== Therefore give out you are of Epidamium,
==2== Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate:
==3== This very day a Syracusian merchant
==4== Is apprehended for arrival here;
==5== And not being able to buy out his life,
==6== According to the statute of the town,
==7== Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
==8== There is your money that I had to keep.

**S. ANT.**
==9== Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
==10== And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
==11== Within this hour it will be dinner-time;
==12== Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town,
==13== Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
==14== And then return and sleep within mine inn,
==15== For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
==16== Get thee away.

**S. DRO.**
==17== Many a man would take you at your word,
==18== And go indeed, having so good a mean.

*Exit Dromio.*

**S. ANT.**
==19== A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
==20== When I am dull with care and melancholy,
==21== Lightens my humor with his merry jests.
==22== What, will you walk with me about the town,
==23== And then go to my inn and dine with me?

**1. MER.**
==24== I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
==25== Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
==26== I crave your pardon. Soon at five a’ clock,
==27== Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart,
==28== And afterward consort you till bed-time:
==29== My present business calls me from you now.

**S. ANT.**
==30== Farewell till then. I will go lose myself,
==31== And wander up and down to view the city.

**1. MER.**
==32== Sir, I commend you to your own content.

*Exit.*

**S. ANT.**
==33== He that commends me to mine own content,
==34== Commends me to the thing I cannot get:
==35== I to the world am like a drop of water,
==36== That in the ocean seeks another drop,
==37== Who, falling there to find his fellow forth
==38== (Unseen, inquisitive), confounds himself.
==39== So I, to find a mother and a brother,
==40== In quest of them (unhappy), ah, lose myself.
*(Enter Dromio of Ephesus.)*
==41== Here comes the almanac of my true date.
==42== What now? How chance thou art return’d so soon?

**E. DRO.**
==43== Return’d so soon! Rather approach’d too late:
==44== The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;
==45== The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell:
==46== My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
==47== She is so hot, because the meat is cold:
==48== The meat is cold, because you come not home:
==49== You come not home, because you have no stomach:
==50== You have no stomach, having broke your fast:
==51== But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray,
==52== Are penitent for your default today.

**S. ANT.**
==53== Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I pray:
==54== Where have you left the money that I gave you?

**E. DRO.**
==55== O—sixpence that I had a’ We’n’sday last
==56== To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper?
==57== The saddler had it, sir, I kept it not.

**S. ANT.**
==58== I am not in a sportive humor now:
==59== Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
==60== We being strangers here, how dar’st thou trust
==61== So great a charge from thine own custody?

**E. DRO.**
==62== I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.
==63== I from my mistress come to you in post:
==64== If I return, I shall be post indeed,
==65== For she will score your fault upon my pate:
==66== Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
==67== And strike you home without a messenger.

**S. ANT.**
==68== Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season,
==69== Reserve them till a merrier hour than this:
==70== Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

**E. DRO.**
==71== To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.

**S. ANT.**
==72== Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
==73== And tell me how thou hast dispos’d thy charge.

**E. DRO.**
==74== My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
==75== Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner;
==76== My mistress and her sister stays for you.

**S. ANT.**
==77== Now, as I am a Christian, answer me,
==78== In what safe place you have bestow’d my money;
==79== Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
==80== That stands on tricks when I am undispos’d:
==81== Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

**E. DRO.**
==82== I have some marks of yours upon my pate;
==83== Some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders;
==84== But not a thousand marks between you both.
==85== If I should pay your worship those again,
==86== Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

**S. ANT.**
==87== Thy mistress’ marks? What mistress, slave, hast thou?

**E. DRO.**
==88== Your worship’s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
==89== She that doth fast till you come home to dinner;
==90== And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

**S. ANT.**
==91== What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
==92== Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

*Strikes Dromio.*

**E. DRO.**
==93== What mean you, sir? For God sake hold your hands!
==94== Nay, and you will not, sir, I’ll take my heels.

*Exit Dromio of Ephesus.*

**S. ANT.**
==95== Upon my life, by some device or other
==96== The villain is o’erraught of all my money.
==97== They say this town is full of cozenage:
==98== As nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
==99== Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
==100== Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
==101== Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
==102== And many such-like liberties of sin:
==103== If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
==104== I’ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave;
==105== I greatly fear my money is not safe.

*Exit.*
