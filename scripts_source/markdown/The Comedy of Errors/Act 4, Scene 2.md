## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A room in the house of Antipholus of Ephesus.*

*Enter Adriana and Luciana.*

**ADR.**
==1==Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
==2==Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
==3==That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no?
==4==Look’d he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
==5==What observation mad’st thou in this case
==6==Of his heart’s meteors tilting in his face?

**LUC.**
==7==First he denied you had in him no right.

**ADR.**
==8==He meant he did me none: the more my spite.

**LUC.**
==9==Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

**ADR.**
==10==And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

**LUC.**
==11==Then pleaded I for you.

**ADR.**
==11==              And what said he?

**LUC.**
==12==That love I begg’d for you, he begg’d of me.

**ADR.**
==13==With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

**LUC.**
==14==With words that in an honest suit might move.
==15==First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

**ADR.**
==16==Didst speak him fair?

**LUC.**
==16==           Have patience, I beseech.

**ADR.**
==17==I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still,
==18==My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
==19==He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,
==20==Ill-fac’d, worse bodied, shapeless every where;
==21==Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind,
==22==Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

**LUC.**
==23==Who would be jealous then of such a one?
==24==No evil lost is wail’d when it is gone.

**ADR.**
==25==Ah, but I think him better than I say,
==26==And yet would herein others’ eyes were worse:
==27==Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;
==28==My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

*Enter Dromio of Syracuse.*

**S. DRO.**
==29==Here, go: the desk, the purse! Sweat now, make haste!

**LUC.**
==30==How hast thou lost thy breath?

**S. DRO.**
==30==                By running fast.

**ADR.**
==31==Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?

**S. DRO.**
==32==No, he’s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell:
==33==A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
==34==One whose hard heart is button’d up with steel;
==35==A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;
==36==A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;
==37==A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands
==38==The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;
==39==A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;
==40==One that before the judgment carries poor souls to hell.

**ADR.**
==41==Why, man, what is the matter?

**S. DRO.**
==42==I do not know the matter, he is ’rested on the case.

**ADR.**
==43==What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.

**S. DRO.**
==44==I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
==45==But ’a’s in a suit of buff which ’rested him, that can I tell.
==46==Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?

**ADR.**
==47==Go fetch it, sister.
*(Exit Luciana.)*
==47==           This I wonder at,
==48==That he unknown to me should be in debt.
==49==Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

**S. DRO.**
==50==Not on a band but on a stronger thing:
==51==A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?

**ADR.**
==52==What, the chain?

**S. DRO.**
==53==No, no, the bell, ’tis time that I were gone:
==54==It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.

**ADR.**
==55==The hours come back! That did I never hear.

**S. DRO.**
==56==O yes, if any hour meet a sergeant, ’a turns back for very fear.

**ADR.**
==57==As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!

**S. DRO.**
==58==Time is a very bankrupt and owes more than he’s worth to season.
==59==Nay, he’s a thief too: have you not heard men say,
==60==That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
==61==If ’a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
==62==Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

*Enter Luciana.*

**ADR.**
==63==Go, Dromio, there’s the money, bear it straight,
==64==And bring thy master home immediately.
==65==Come, sister, I am press’d down with conceit⁠—
==66==Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

*Exeunt.*
