## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*A hall in Duke Solinus’s Palace.*

*Enter the Duke of Ephesus with Egeon the merchant of Syracuse, Jailer with Officers, and other Attendants.*

**EGE.**
==1== Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,
==2== And by the doom of death end woes and all.

**DUKE.**
==3== Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more.
==4== I am not partial to infringe our laws;
==5== The enmity and discord which of late
==6== Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke
==7== To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
==8== Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,
==9== Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
==10== Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks:
==11== For since the mortal and intestine jars
==12== ’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
==13== It hath in solemn synods been decreed,
==14== Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
==15== To admit no traffic to our adverse towns:
==16== Nay more, if any born at Ephesus be seen
==17== At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
==18== Again, if any Syracusian born
==19== Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
==20== His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,
==21== Unless a thousand marks be levied
==22== To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
==23== Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
==24== Cannot amount unto a hundred marks,
==25== Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die.

**EGE.**
==26== Yet this my comfort, when your words are done,
==27== My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

**DUKE.**
==28== Well, Syracusian; say in brief the cause
==29== Why thou departedst from thy native home,
==30== And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.

**EGE.**
==31== A heavier task could not have been impos’d
==32== Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
==33== Yet that the world may witness that my end
==34== Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,
==35== I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.
==36== In Syracuse was I born, and wed
==37== Unto a woman, happy but for me,
==38== And by me, had not our hap been bad:
==39== With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d
==40== By prosperous voyages I often made
==41== To Epidamium, till my factor’s death,
==42== And the great care of goods at random left,
==43== Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;
==44== From whom my absence was not six months old
==45== Before herself (almost at fainting under
==46== The pleasing punishment that women bear) 
==47== Had made provision for her following me,
==48== And soon, and safe, arrived where I was.
==49== There had she not been long but she became
==50== A joyful mother of two goodly sons:
==51== And, which was strange, the one so like the other
==52== As could not be distinguish’d but by names.
==53== That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
==54== A mean woman was delivered
==55== Of such a burden male, twins both alike.
==56== Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,
==57== I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.
==58== My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
==59== Made daily motions for our home return:
==60== Unwilling I agreed. Alas! Too soon
==61== We came aboard.
==62== A league from Epidamium had we sail’d
==63== Before the always-wind-obeying deep
==64== Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
==65== But longer did we not retain much hope;
==66== For what obscured light the heavens did grant
==67== Did but convey unto our fearful minds
==68== A doubtful warrant of immediate death,
==69== Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d,
==70== Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
==71== Weeping before for what she saw must come,
==72== And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
==73== That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
==74== Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me.
==75== And this it was (for other means was none):
==76== The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
==77== And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.
==78== My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
==79== Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,
==80== Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;
==81== To him one of the other twins was bound,
==82== Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.
==83== The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,
==84== Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,
==85== Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,
==86== And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
==87== Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
==88== At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
==89== Dispers’d those vapors that offended us,
==90== And by the benefit of his wished light
==91== The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered
==92== Two ships from far, making amain to us,
==93== Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.
==94== But ere they came—O, let me say no more!
==95== Gather the sequel by that went before.

**DUKE.**
==96== Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,
==97== For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

**EGE.**
==98== O, had the gods done so, I had not now
==99== Worthily term’d them merciless to us!
==100== For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
==101== We were encount’red by a mighty rock,
==102== Which being violently borne upon,
==103== Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
==104== So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
==105== Fortune had left to both of us alike
==106== What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
==107== Her part, poor soul! Seeming as burdened
==108== With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,
==109== Was carried with more speed before the wind,
==110== And in our sight they three were taken up
==111== By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
==112== At length, another ship had seiz’d on us,
==113== And knowing whom it was their hap to save,
==114== Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrack’d guests,
==115== And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
==116== Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
==117== And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
==118== Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,
==119== That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d,
==120== To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

**DUKE.**
==121== And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
==122== Do me the favor to dilate at full
==123== What have befall’n of them and thee till now.

**EGE.**
==124== My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
==125== At eighteen years became inquisitive
==126== After his brother; and importun’d me
==127== That his attendant—so his case was like,
==128== Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name⁠—
==129== Might bear him company in the quest of him:
==130== Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,
==131== I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d.
==132== Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,
==133== Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
==134== And coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
==135== Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
==136== Or that, or any place that harbors men.
==137== But here must end the story of my life,
==138== And happy were I in my timely death,
==139== Could all my travels warrant me they live.

**DUKE.**
==140== Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d
==141== To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
==142== Now trust me, were it not against our laws,
==143== Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
==144== Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
==145== My soul should sue as advocate for thee:
==146== But though thou art adjudged to the death,
==147== And passed sentence may not be recall’d
==148== But to our honor’s great disparagement,
==149== Yet will I favor thee in what I can;
==150== Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day
==151== To seek thy health by beneficial help.
==152== Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
==153== Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
==154== And live: if no, then thou art doom’d to die.
==155== Jailer, take him to thy custody.

**JAIL.**
==156== I will, my lord.

**EGE.**
==157== Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,
==158== But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

*Exeunt.*
