## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*The house of Antipholus of Ephesus.*

*Enter Adriana, wife to Antipholus Sereptus of Ephesus, with Luciana, her sister.*

**ADR.**
==1==Neither my husband nor the slave return’d,
==2==That in such haste I sent to seek his master?
==3==Sure, Luciana, it is two a’ clock.

**LUC.**
==4==Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
==5==And from the mart he’s somewhere gone to dinner.
==6==Good sister, let us dine, and never fret;
==7==A man is master of his liberty:
==8==Time is their master, and when they see time,
==9==They’ll go or come; if so, be patient, sister.

**ADR.**
==10==Why should their liberty than ours be more?

**LUC.**
==11==Because their business still lies out a’ door.

**ADR.**
==12==Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

**LUC.**
==13==O, know he is the bridle of your will.

**ADR.**
==14==There’s none but asses will be bridled so.

**LUC.**
==15==Why, headstrong liberty is lash’d with woe:
==16==There’s nothing situate under heaven’s eye
==17==But hath his bound in earth, in sea, in sky.
==18==The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls
==19==Are their males’ subjects and at their controls:
==20==Man, more divine, the master of all these,
==21==Lord of the wide world and wild wat’ry seas,
==22==Indu’d with intellectual sense and souls,
==23==Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,
==24==Are masters to their females, and their lords:
==25==Then let your will attend on their accords.

**ADR.**
==26==This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

**LUC.**
==27==Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

**ADR.**
==28==But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

**LUC.**
==29==Ere I learn love, I’ll practice to obey.

**ADR.**
==30==How if your husband start some other where?

**LUC.**
==31==Till he come home again, I would forbear.

**ADR.**
==32==Patience unmov’d! No marvel though she pause⁠—
==33==They can be meek that have no other cause:
==34==A wretched soul, bruis’d with adversity,
==35==We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
==36==But were we burd’ned with like weight of pain,
==37==As much, or more, we should ourselves complain:
==38==So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
==39==With urging helpless patience would relieve me;
==40==But if thou live to see like right bereft,
==41==This fool-begg’d patience in thee will be left.

**LUC.**
==42==Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
==43==Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.

*Enter Dromio of Ephesus.*

**ADR.**
==44==Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

**E. DRO.**
==45==Nay, he’s at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.

**ADR.**
==46==Say, didst thou speak with him? Know’st thou his mind?

**E. DRO.**
==47==Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear. Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

**LUC.**
==48==Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?

**E. DRO.**
==49==Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully, that I could scarce understand them.

**ADR.**
==50==But say, I prithee, is he coming home?
==51==It seems he hath great care to please his wife.

**E. DRO.**
==52==Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

**ADR.**
==53==Horn-mad, thou villain!

**E. DRO.**
==53==              I mean not cuckold-mad⁠—
==54==But sure he is stark mad:
==55==When I desir’d him to come home to dinner,
==56==He ask’d me for a thousand marks in gold:
==57==“’Tis dinner-time,” quoth I: “My gold!” quoth he.
==58==“Your meat doth burn,” quoth I: “My gold!” quoth he.
==59==“Will you come?” quoth I: “My gold!” quoth he;
==60==“Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?”
==61==“The pig,” quoth I, “is burn’d”: “My gold!” quoth he.
==62==“My mistress, sir,” quoth I: “Hang up thy mistress!
==63==I know not thy mistress, out on thy mistress!”

**LUC.**
==64==Quoth who?

**E. DRO.**
==65==Quoth my master.
==66==“I know,” quoth he, “no house, no wife, no mistress.”
==67==So that my arrant, due unto my tongue,
==68==I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders:
==69==For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

**ADR.**
==70==Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

**E. DRO.**
==71==Go back again, and be new beaten home?
==72==For God’s sake send some other messenger.

**ADR.**
==73==Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

**E. DRO.**
==74==And he will bless that cross with other beating:
==75==Between you I shall have a holy head.

**ADR.**
==76==Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.

**E. DRO.**
==77==Am I so round with you, as you with me,
==78==That like a football you do spurn me thus?
==79==You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
==80==If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

*Exit.*

**LUC.**
==81==Fie, how impatience low’reth in your face!

**ADR.**
==82==His company must do his minions grace,
==83==Whilst I at home starve for a merry look:
==84==Hath homely age th’ alluring beauty took
==85==From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.
==86==Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?
==87==If voluble and sharp discourse be marr’d,
==88==Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.
==89==Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
==90==That’s not my fault, he’s master of my state.
==91==What ruins are in me that can be found,
==92==By him not ruin’d? Then is he the ground
==93==Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
==94==A sunny look of his would soon repair.
==95==But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,
==96==And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

**LUC.**
==97==Self-harming jealousy—fie, beat it hence!

**ADR.**
==98==Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense:
==99==I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
==100==Or else what lets it but he would be here?
==101==Sister, you know he promis’d me a chain;
==102==Would that alone a’ love he would detain,
==103==So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
==104==I see the jewel best enamelled
==105==Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still
==106==That others touch and, often touching, will
==107==Where gold; and no man that hath a name
==108==By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
==109==Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
==110==I’ll weep what’s left away, and weeping die.

**LUC.**
==111==How many fond fools serve mad jealousy?

*Exeunt.*
