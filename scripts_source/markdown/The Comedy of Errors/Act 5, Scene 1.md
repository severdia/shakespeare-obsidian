## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]]

*A street before an abbey.*

*Enter the Second Merchant and Angelo the goldsmith.*

**ANG.**
==1==I am sorry, sir, that I have hind’red you,
==2==But I protest he had the chain of me,
==3==Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

**2. MER.**
==4==How is the man esteem’d here in the city?

**ANG.**
==5==Of very reverent reputation, sir,
==6==Of credit infinite, highly belov’d,
==7==Second to none that lives here in the city:
==8==His word might bear my wealth at any time.

**2. MER.**
==9==Speak softly, yonder, as I think, he walks.

*Enter Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse again.*

**ANG.**
==10==’Tis so; and that self chain about his neck,
==11==Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
==12==Good sir, draw near to me, I’ll speak to him.
==13==*Signior* Antipholus, I wonder much
==14==That you would put me to this shame and trouble,
==15==And, not without some scandal to yourself,
==16==With circumstance and oaths so to deny
==17==This chain which now you wear so openly.
==18==Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
==19==You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
==20==Who, but for staying on our controversy,
==21==Had hoisted sail and put to sea today.
==22==This chain you had of me, can you deny it?

**S. ANT.**
==23==I think I had, I never did deny it.

**2. MER.**
==24==Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

**S. ANT.**
==25==Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

**2. MER.**
==26==These ears of mine thou know’st did hear thee;
==27==Fie on thee, wretch, ’tis pity that thou liv’st
==28==To walk where any honest men resort.

**S. ANT.**
==29==Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
==30==I’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty
==31==Against thee presently, if thou dar’st stand.

**2. MER.**
==32==I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

*They draw.*

*Enter Adriana, Luciana, Courtesan, and others.*

**ADR.**
==33==Hold, hurt him not for God sake! He is mad.
==34==Some get within him, take his sword away:
==35==Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

**S. DRO.**
==36==Run, master, run, for God’s sake take a house!
==37==This is some priory, in, or we are spoil’d.

*Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the priory.*

*Enter Lady Abbess Aemilia.*

**ABB.**
==38==Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

**ADR.**
==39==To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
==40==Let us come in, that we may bind him fast,
==41==And bear him home for his recovery.

**ANG.**
==42==I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

**2. MER.**
==43==I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

**ABB.**
==44==How long hath this possession held the man?

**ADR.**
==45==This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
==46==And much different from the man he was;
==47==But till this afternoon his passion
==48==Ne’er brake into extremity of rage.

**ABB.**
==49==Hath he not lost much wealth by wrack of sea?
==50==Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
==51==Stray’d his affection in unlawful love⁠—
==52==A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
==53==Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing?
==54==Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

**ADR.**
==55==To none of these, except it be the last,
==56==Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

**ABB.**
==57==You should for that have reprehended him.

**ADR.**
==58==Why, so I did.

**ABB.**
==58==        Ay, but not rough enough.

**ADR.**
==59==As roughly as my modesty would let me.

**ABB.**
==60==Haply, in private.

**ADR.**
==60==           And in assemblies too.

**ABB.**
==61==Ay, but not enough.

**ADR.**
==62==It was the copy of our conference:
==63==In bed he slept not for my urging it;
==64==At board he fed not for my urging it;
==65==Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
==66==In company I often glanced it;
==67==Still did I tell him it was vild and bad.

**ABB.**
==68==And thereof came it that the man was mad.
==69==The venom clamors of a jealous woman
==70==Poisons more deadly than a mad dog’s tooth.
==71==It seems his sleeps were hind’red by thy railing,
==72==And thereof comes it that his head is light.
==73==Thou say’st his meat was sauc’d with thy upbraidings:
==74==Unquiet meals make ill digestions,
==75==Thereof the raging fire of fever bred,
==76==And what’s a fever but a fit of madness?
==77==Thou say’st his sports were hind’red by thy brawls:
==78==Sweet recreation barr’d, what doth ensue
==79==But moody and dull melancholy,
==80==Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
==81==And at her heels a huge infectious troop
==82==Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
==83==In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest
==84==To be disturb’d, would mad or man or beast:
==85==The consequence is then, thy jealous fits
==86==Hath scar’d thy husband from the use of wits.

**LUC.**
==87==She never reprehended him but mildly,
==88==When he demean’d himself rough, rude, and wildly.
==89==Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?

**ADR.**
==90==She did betray me to my own reproof.
==91==Good people, enter and lay hold on him.

**ABB.**
==92==No, not a creature enters in my house.

**ADR.**
==93==Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

**ABB.**
==94==Neither. He took this place for sanctuary,
==95==And it shall privilege him from your hands
==96==Till I have brought him to his wits again,
==97==Or lose my labor in assaying it.

**ADR.**
==98==I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
==99==Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
==100==And will have no attorney but myself,
==101==And therefore let me have him home with me.

**ABB.**
==102==Be patient, for I will not let him stir
==103==Till I have us’d the approved means I have,
==104==With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,
==105==To make of him a formal man again:
==106==It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
==107==A charitable duty of my order,
==108==Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.

**ADR.**
==109==I will not hence, and leave my husband here;
==110==And ill it doth beseem your holiness
==111==To separate the husband and the wife.

**ABB.**
==112==Be quiet and depart, thou shalt not have him.

*Exit.*

**LUC.**
==113==Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.

**ADR.**
==114==Come go: I will fall prostrate at his feet,
==115==And never rise until my tears and prayers
==116==Have won his Grace to come in person hither,
==117==And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

**2. MER.**
==118==By this I think the dial points at five.
==119==Anon I’m sure the Duke himself in person
==120==Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
==121==The place of death and sorry execution,
==122==Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

**ANG.**
==123==Upon what cause?

**2. MER.**
==124==To see a reverent Syracusian merchant,
==125==Who put unluckily into this bay
==126==Against the laws and statutes of this town,
==127==Beheaded publicly for his offense.

**ANG.**
==128==See where they come, we will behold his death.

**LUC.**
==129==Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.

*Enter the Duke of Ephesus attended and Egeon the merchant of Syracuse, bare-head, with the Headsman and other Officers.*

**DUKE.**
==130==Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
==131==If any friend will pay the sum for him,
==132==He shall not die, so much we tender him.

**ADR.**
==133==Justice, most sacred Duke, against the abbess!

**DUKE.**
==134==She is a virtuous and a reverend lady,
==135==It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

**ADR.**
==136==May it please your Grace, Antipholus my husband,
==137==Who I made lord of me and all I had,
==138==At your important letters—this ill day
==139==A most outrageous fit of madness took him,
==140==That desp’rately he hurried through the street⁠—
==141==With him his bondman, all as mad as he⁠—
==142==Doing displeasure to the citizens
==143==By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
==144==Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
==145==Once did I get him bound, and sent him home,
==146==Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
==147==That here and there his fury had committed.
==148==Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
==149==He broke from those that had the guard of him,
==150==And with his mad attendant and himself,
==151==Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
==152==Met us again, and madly bent on us
==153==Chas’d us away; till raising of more aid,
==154==We came again to bind them. Then they fled
==155==Into this abbey, whither we pursu’d them,
==156==And here the abbess shuts the gates on us,
==157==And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
==158==Nor send him forth, that we may bear him hence.
==159==Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command
==160==Let him be brought forth, and borne hence for help.

**DUKE.**
==161==Long since thy husband serv’d me in my wars,
==162==And I to thee engag’d a prince’s word,
==163==When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
==164==To do him all the grace and good I could.
==165==Go some of you, knock at the abbey-gate,
==166==And bid the Lady Abbess come to me:
==167==I will determine this before I stir.

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
==168==O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
==169==My master and his man are both broke loose,
==170==Beaten the maids a-row, and bound the doctor,
==171==Whose beard they have sing’d off with brands of fire,
==172==And ever as it blaz’d, they threw on him
==173==Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair;
==174==My master preaches patience to him, and the while
==175==His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;
==176==And sure (unless you send some present help) 
==177==Between them they will kill the conjurer.

**ADR.**
==178==Peace, fool, thy master and his man are here,
==179==And that is false thou dost report to us.

**MESS.**
==180==Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
==181==I have not breath’d almost since I did see it.
==182==He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
==183==To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.
*(Cry within.)*
==184==Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!

**DUKE.**
==185==Come stand by me, fear nothing. Guard with halberds!

**ADR.**
==186==Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
==187==That he is borne about invisible:
==188==Even now we hous’d him in the abbey here,
==189==And now he’s there, past thought of human reason.

*Enter Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio of Ephesus.*

**E. ANT.**
==190==Justice, most gracious Duke, O, grant me justice,
==191==Even for the service that long since I did thee,
==192==When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took
==193==Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
==194==That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

**EGE.**
==195==Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
==196==I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.

**E. ANT.**
==197==Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
==198==She whom thou gav’st to me to be my wife;
==199==That hath abused and dishonored me,
==200==Even in the strength and height of injury:
==201==Beyond imagination is the wrong
==202==That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

**DUKE.**
==203==Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

**E. ANT.**
==204==This day, great Duke, she shut the doors upon me,
==205==While she with harlots feasted in my house.

**DUKE.**
==206==A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?

**ADR.**
==207==No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister
==208==Today did dine together: so befall my soul
==209==As this is false he burdens me withal!

**LUC.**
==210==Ne’er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
==211==But she tells to your Highness simple truth!

**ANG.**
==212==O perjur’d woman! They are both forsworn:
==213==In this the madman justly chargeth them.

**E. ANT.**
==214==My liege, I am advised what I say,
==215==Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
==216==Nor heady-rash, provok’d with raging ire,
==217==Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
==218==This woman lock’d me out this day from dinner;
==219==That goldsmith there, were he not pack’d with her,
==220==Could witness it, for he was with me then,
==221==Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
==222==Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
==223==Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
==224==Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
==225==I went to seek him. In the street I met him,
==226==And in his company that gentleman.
==227==There did this perjur’d goldsmith swear me down
==228==That I this day of him receiv’d the chain,
==229==Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which
==230==He did arrest me with an officer.
==231==I did obey, and sent my peasant home
==232==For certain ducats; he with none return’d.
==233==Then fairly I bespoke the officer
==234==To go in person with me to my house.
==235==By th’ way we met
==236==My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
==237==Of vild confederates. Along with them
==238==They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac’d villain,
==239==A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
==240==A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
==241==A needy, hollow-ey’d, sharp-looking wretch,
==242==A living dead man. This pernicious slave,
==243==Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
==244==And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
==245==And with no face, as ’twere, outfacing me,
==246==Cries out, I was possess’d. Then all together
==247==They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,
==248==And in a dark and dankish vault at home
==249==There left me and my man, both bound together,
==250==Till gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
==251==I gain’d my freedom; and immediately
==252==Ran hither to your Grace, whom I beseech
==253==To give me ample satisfaction
==254==For these deep shames and great indignities.

**ANG.**
==255==My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him:
==256==That he din’d not at home, but was lock’d out.

**DUKE.**
==257==But had he such a chain of thee, or no?

**ANG.**
==258==He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,
==259==These people saw the chain about his neck.

**2. MER.**
==260==Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
==261==Heard you confess you had the chain of him,
==262==After you first forswore it on the mart,
==263==And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
==264==And then you fled into this abbey here,
==265==From whence I think you are come by miracle.

**E. ANT.**
==266==I never came within these abbey walls,
==267==Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;
==268==I never saw the chain, so help me heaven;
==269==And this is false you burden me withal.

**DUKE.**
==270==Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
==271==I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.
==272==If here you hous’d him, here he would have been;
==273==If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.
==274==You say he din’d at home; the goldsmith here
==275==Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?

**E. DRO.**
==276==Sir, he din’d with her there, at the Porpentine.

**COUR.**
==277==He did, and from my finger snatch’d that ring.

**E. ANT.**
==278==’Tis true, my liege, this ring I had of her.

**DUKE.**
==279==Saw’st thou him enter at the abbey here?

**COUR.**
==280==As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.

**DUKE.**
==281==Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
==282==I think you are all mated, or stark mad.

*Exit one to the abbess.*

**EGE.**
==283==Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
==284==Haply I see a friend will save my life,
==285==And pay the sum that may deliver me.

**DUKE.**
==286==Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

**EGE.**
==287==Is not your name, sir, call’d Antipholus?
==288==And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

**E. DRO.**
==289==Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,
==290==But he, I thank him, gnaw’d in two my cords:
==291==Now am I Dromio, and his man, unbound.

**EGE.**
==292==I am sure you both of you remember me.

**E. DRO.**
==293==Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
==294==For lately we were bound as you are now.
==295==You are not Pinch’s patient, are you, sir?

**EGE.**
==296==Why look you strange on me? You know me well.

**E. ANT.**
==297==I never saw you in my life till now.

**EGE.**
==298==O! Grief hath chang’d me since you saw me last,
==299==And careful hours with time’s deformed hand
==300==Have written strange defeatures in my face:
==301==But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

**E. ANT.**
==302==Neither.

**EGE.**
==303==Dromio, nor thou?

**E. DRO.**
==303==           No, trust me, sir, nor I.

**EGE.**
==304==I am sure thou dost!

**E. DRO.**
==305==Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not—and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.

**EGE.**
==306==Not know my voice! O time’s extremity,
==307==Hast thou so crack’d and splitted my poor tongue
==308==In seven short years, that here my only son
==309==Knows not my feeble key of untun’d cares?
==310==Though now this grained face of mine be hid
==311==In sap-consuming winter’s drizzled snow,
==312==And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
==313==Yet hath my night of life some memory,
==314==My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
==315==My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
==316==All these old witnesses—I cannot err⁠—
==317==Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.

**E. ANT.**
==318==I never saw my father in my life.

**EGE.**
==319==But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,
==320==Thou know’st we parted, but perhaps, my son,
==321==Thou sham’st to acknowledge me in misery.

**E. ANT.**
==322==The Duke, and all that know me in the city,
==323==Can witness with me that it is not so.
==324==I ne’er saw Syracuse in my life.

**DUKE.**
==325==I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
==326==Have I been patron to Antipholus,
==327==During which time he ne’er saw Syracuse:
==328==I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

*Enter the abbess with Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse.*

**ABB.**
==329==Most mighty Duke, behold a man much wrong’d.

*All gather to see them.*

**ADR.**
==330==I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

**DUKE.**
==331==One of these men is genius to the other:
==332==And so of these, which is the natural man,
==333==And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?

**S. DRO.**
==334==I, sir, am Dromio, command him away.

**E. DRO.**
==335==I, sir, am Dromio, pray let me stay.

**S. ANT.**
==336==Egeon art thou not? Or else his ghost?

**S. DRO.**
==337==O my old master, who hath bound him here?

**ABB.**
==338==Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,
==339==And gain a husband by his liberty.
==340==Speak, old Egeon, if thou be’st the man
==341==That hadst a wife once call’d Aemilia,
==342==That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.
==343==O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak,
==344==And speak unto the same Aemilia!

**EGE.**
==345==If I dream not, thou art Aemilia.
==346==If thou art she, tell me, where is that son
==347==That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

**ABB.**
==348==By men of Epidamium he and I,
==349==And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;
==350==But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
==351==By force took Dromio and my son from them,
==352==And me they left with those of Epidamium.
==353==What then became of them I cannot tell;
==354==I to this fortune that you see me in.

**DUKE.**
==355==Why, here begins his morning story right:
==356==These two Antipholus’, these two so like,
==357==And these two Dromios, one in semblance⁠—
==358==Besides her urging of her wrack at sea⁠—
==359==These are the parents to these children,
==360==Which accidentally are met together.
==361==Antipholus, thou cam’st from Corinth first?

**S. ANT.**
==362==No, sir, not I, I came from Syracuse.

**DUKE.**
==363==Stay, stand apart, I know not which is which.

**E. ANT.**
==364==I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord⁠—

**E. DRO.**
==365==And I with him.

**E. ANT.**
==366==Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
==367==Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

**ADR.**
==368==Which of you two did dine with me today?

**S. ANT.**
==369==I, gentle mistress.

**ADR.**
==369==           And are not you my husband?

**E. ANT.**
==370==No, I say nay to that.

**S. ANT.**
==371==And so do I, yet did she call me so;
==372==And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
==373==Did call me brother.
*(To Luciana.)*
==373==           What I told you then
==374==I hope I shall have leisure to make good,
==375==If this be not a dream I see and hear.

**ANG.**
==376==That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

**S. ANT.**
==377==I think it be, sir, I deny it not.

**E. ANT.**
==378==And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

**ANG.**
==379==I think I did, sir, I deny it not.

**ADR.**
==380==I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
==381==By Dromio, but I think he brought it not.

**E. DRO.**
==382==No, none by me.

**S. ANT.**
==383==This purse of ducats I receiv’d from you,
==384==And Dromio my man did bring them me.
==385==I see we still did meet each other’s man,
==386==And I was ta’en for him, and he for me,
==387==And thereupon these errors are arose.

**E. ANT.**
==388==These ducats pawn I for my father here.

**DUKE.**
==389==It shall not need, thy father hath his life.

**COUR.**
==390==Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

**E. ANT.**
==391==There take it, and much thanks for my good cheer.

**ABB.**
==392==Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
==393==To go with us into the abbey here,
==394==And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;
==395==And all that are assembled in this place
==396==That by this sympathized one day’s error
==397==Have suffer’d wrong, go keep us company,
==398==And we shall make full satisfaction.
==399==Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
==400==Of you, my sons, and till this present hour
==401==My heavy burden ne’er delivered.
==402==The Duke, my husband, and my children both,
==403==And you the calendars of their nativity,
==404==Go to a gossips’ feast, and go with me⁠—
==405==After so long grief, such nativity!

**DUKE.**
==406==With all my heart, I’ll gossip at this feast.

*Exeunt omnes. Manent the two Dromios and two brothers.*

**S. DRO.**
==407==Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?

**E. ANT.**
==408==Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark’d?

**S. DRO.**
==409==Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

**S. ANT.**
==410==He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio.
==411==Come go with us, we’ll look to that anon.
==412==Embrace thy brother there, rejoice with him.

*Exit with Antipholus of Ephesus.*

**S. DRO.**
==413==There is a fat friend at your master’s house,
==414==That kitchen’d me for you today at dinner:
==415==She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

**E. DRO.**
==416==Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
==417==I see by you I am a sweet-fac’d youth.
==418==Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

**S. DRO.**
==419==Not I, sir, you are my elder.

**E. DRO.**
==420==That’s a question; how shall we try it?

**S. DRO.**
==421==We’ll draw cuts for the senior, till then, lead thou first.

**E. DRO.**
==422==Nay then thus:
==423==We came into the world like brother and brother;
==424==And now let’s go hand in hand, not one before another.

*Exeunt.*
