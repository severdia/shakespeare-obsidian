## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Before the house of Antipholus of Ephesus.*

*Enter Antipholus of Ephesus, his man Dromio of Ephesus, Angelo the goldsmith, and Balthazar the merchant.*

**E. ANT.**
==1==Good *Signior* Angelo, you must excuse us all,
==2==My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
==3==Say that I linger’d with you at your shop
==4==To see the making of her carcanet,
==5==And that tomorrow you will bring it home.
==6==But here’s a villain that would face me down
==7==He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
==8==And charg’d him with a thousand marks in gold,
==9==And that I did deny my wife and house.
==10==Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

**E. DRO.**
==11==Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know:
==12==That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show;
==13==If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
==14==Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

**E. ANT.**
==15==I think thou art an ass.

**E. DRO.**
==15==           Marry, so it doth appear
==16==By the wrongs I suffer, and the blows I bear.
==17==I should kick, being kick’d, and being at that pass,
==18==You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.

**E. ANT.**
==19==Y’ are sad, *Signior* Balthazar, pray God our cheer
==20==May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

**BALTH.**
==21==I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear.

**E. ANT.**
==22==O, *Signior* Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
==23==A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.

**BALTH.**
==24==Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

**E. ANT.**
==25==And welcome more common, for that’s nothing but words.

**BALTH.**
==26==Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

**E. ANT.**
==27==Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing guest:
==28==But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
==29==Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
==30==But soft, my door is lock’d; go bid them let us in.

**E. DRO.**
==31==Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cic’ly, Gillian, Ginn!

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==32==Mome, malt-horse, capon, cox-comb, idiot, patch!
==33==Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch;
==34==Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call’st for such store,
==35==When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.

**E. DRO.**
==36==What patch is made our porter? My master stays in the street.

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==37==Let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on ’s feet.

**E. ANT.**
==38==Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==39==Right, sir, I’ll tell you when, and you’ll tell me wherefore.

**E. ANT.**
==40==Wherefore? For my dinner: I have not din’d today.

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==41==Nor today here you must not, come again when you may.

**E. ANT.**
==42==What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==43==The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.

**E. DRO.**
==44==O villain, thou hast stol’n both mine office and my name:
==45==The one ne’er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
==46==If thou hadst been Dromio today in my place,
==47==Thou wouldst have chang’d thy face for a name, or thy name for an ass.

*Enter Luce within.*

**LUCE.**
*(Within.)*
==48==What a coil is there, Dromio?
==49==Who are those at the gate?

**E. DRO.**
==50==Let my master in, Luce.

**LUCE.**
*(Within.)*
==50==              Faith, no, he comes too late,
==51==And so tell your master.

**E. DRO.**
==51==              O Lord, I must laugh!
==52==Have at you with a proverb—Shall I set in my staff?

**LUCE.**
*(Within.)*
==53==Have at you with another, that’s—When? Can you tell?

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==54==If thy name be called Luce—Luce, thou hast answer’d him well.

**E. ANT.**
==55==Do you hear, you minion? You’ll let us in, I hope?

**LUCE.**
*(Within.)*
==56==I thought to have ask’d you.

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==56==                And you said no.

**E. DRO.**
==57==So come help: well struck! There was blow for blow.

**E. ANT.**
==58==Thou baggage, let me in.

**LUCE.**
*(Within.)*
==58==              Can you tell for whose sake?

**E. DRO.**
==59==Master, knock the door hard.

**LUCE.**
*(Within.)*
==59==                Let him knock till it ache.

**E. ANT.**
==60==You’ll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

**LUCE.**
*(Within.)*
==61==What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

*Enter Adriana within.*

**ADR.**
*(Within.)*
==62==Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==63==By my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys.

**E. ANT.**
==64==Are you there, wife? You might have come before.

**ADR.**
*(Within.)*
==65==Your wife, sir knave? Go get you from the door.

**E. DRO.**
==66==If you went in pain, master, this knave would go sore.

**ANG.**
==67==Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either.

**BALTH.**
==68==In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

**E. DRO.**
==69==They stand at the door, master, bid them welcome hither.

**E. ANT.**
==70==There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.

**E. DRO.**
==71==You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
==72==Your cake here is warm within: you stand here in the cold.
==73==It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.

**E. ANT.**
==74==Go fetch me something: I’ll break ope the gate.

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==75==Break any breaking here, and I’ll break your knave’s pate.

**E. DRO.**
==76==A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind:
==77==Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==78==It seems thou want’st breaking, out upon thee, hind!

**E. DRO.**
==79==Here’s too much “out upon thee!”; I pray thee let me in.

**S. DRO.**
*(Within.)*
==80==Ay, when fowls have no feathers, and fish have no fin.

**E. ANT.**
==81==Well, I’ll break in: go borrow me a crow.

**E. DRO.**
==82==A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
==83==For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather:
==84==If a crow help us in, sirrah, we’ll pluck a crow together.

**E. ANT.**
==85==Go, get thee gone, fetch me an iron crow.

**BALTH.**
==86==Have patience, sir, O, let it not be so!
==87==Herein you war against your reputation,
==88==And draw within the compass of suspect
==89==Th’ unviolated honor of your wife.
==90==Once this—your long experience of her wisdom,
==91==Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,
==92==Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;
==93==And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
==94==Why at this time the doors are made against you.
==95==Be rul’d by me, depart in patience,
==96==And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;
==97==And about evening come yourself alone
==98==To know the reason of this strange restraint.
==99==If by strong hand you offer to break in
==100==Now in the stirring passage of the day,
==101==A vulgar comment will be made of it;
==102==And that supposed by the common rout
==103==Against your yet ungalled estimation,
==104==That may with foul intrusion enter in,
==105==And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
==106==For slander lives upon succession,
==107==Forever hous’d where it gets possession.

**E. ANT.**
==108==You have prevail’d. I will depart in quiet,
==109==And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.
==110==I know a wench of excellent discourse,
==111==Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;
==112==There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
==113==My wife (but, I protest, without desert) 
==114==Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
==115==To her will we to dinner.
*(To Angelo.)*
==116==Get you home
==117==And fetch the chain; by this I know ’tis made.
==118==Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine,
==119==For there’s the house. That chain will I bestow
==120==(Be it for nothing but to spite my wife) 
==121==Upon mine hostess there. Good sir, make haste.
==122==Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
==123==I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.

**ANG.**
==124==I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.

**E. ANT.**
==125==Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

*Exeunt.*
