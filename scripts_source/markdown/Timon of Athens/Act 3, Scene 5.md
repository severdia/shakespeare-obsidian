## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 6|Act 3, Scene 6 →]]

*Athens. The Senate House.*

*Enter three Senators at one door, Alcibiades meeting them, with Attendants.*

**1. SEN.**
==1== My lord, you have my voice to’t; the fault’s
==2== Bloody; ’tis necessary he should die.
==3== Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.

**2. SEN.**
==4== Most true; the law shall bruise ’em.

**ALCIB.**
==5== Honor, health, and compassion to the Senate!

**1. SEN.**
==6== Now, captain?

**ALCIB.**
==7== I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
==8== For pity is the virtue of the law,
==9== And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
==10== It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
==11== Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood
==12== Hath stepp’d into the law, which is past depth
==13== To those that (without heed) do plunge into’t.
==14== He is a man (setting his fate aside) 
==15== Of comely virtues;
==16== Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice
==17== (An honor in him which buys out his fault),
==18== But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
==19== Seeing his reputation touch’d to death,
==20== He did oppose his foe;
==21== And with such sober and unnoted passion
==22== He did behoove his anger, ere ’twas spent,
==23== As if he had but prov’d an argument.

**1. SEN.**
==24== You undergo too strict a paradox,
==25== Striving to make an ugly deed look fair.
==26== Your words have took such pains as if they labor’d
==27== To bring manslaughter into form, and set quarreling
==28== Upon the head of valor; which indeed
==29== Is valor misbegot, and came into the world
==30== When sects and factions were newly born.
==31== He’s truly valiant that can wisely suffer
==32== The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
==33== His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,
==34== And ne’er prefer his injuries to his heart,
==35== To bring it into danger.
==36== If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
==37== What folly ’tis to hazard life for ill!

**ALCIB.**
==38== My lord⁠—

**1. SEN.**
==38==     You cannot make gross sins look clear;
==39== To revenge is no valor, but to bear.

**ALCIB.**
==40== My lords, then, under favor, pardon me
==41== If I speak like a captain.
==42== Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
==43== And not endure all threats? Sleep upon’t,
==44== And let the foes quietly cut their throats
==45== Without repugnancy? If there be
==46== Such valor in the bearing, what make we
==47== Abroad? Why then, women are more valiant
==48== That stay at home, if bearing carry it;
==49== And the ass more captain than the lion, the fellow
==50== Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
==51== If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
==52== As you are great, be pitifully good.
==53== Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
==54== To kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust,
==55== But in defense, by mercy, ’tis most just.
==56== To be in anger is impiety;
==57== But who is man that is not angry?
==58== Weigh but the crime with this.

**2. SEN.**
==59== You breathe in vain.

**ALCIB.**
==59==            In vain? His service done
==60== At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
==61== Were a sufficient briber for his life.

**1. SEN.**
==62== What’s that?

**ALCIB.**
==62==         Why, I say, my lords, h’as done fair service,
==63== And slain in fight many of your enemies.
==64== How full of valor did he bear himself
==65== In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!

**2. SEN.**
==66== He has made too much plenty with ’em.
==67== He’s a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often
==68== Drowns him and takes his valor prisoner.
==69== If there were no foes, that were enough
==70== To overcome him. In that beastly fury
==71== He has been known to commit outrages
==72== And cherish factions. ’Tis inferr’d to us,
==73== His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

**1. SEN.**
==74== He dies.

**ALCIB.**
==74==     Hard fate! He might have died in war.
==75== My lords, if not for any parts in him⁠—
==76== Though his right arm might purchase his own time
==77== And be in debt to none—yet more to move you,
==78== Take my deserts to his, and join ’em both;
==79== And for I know your reverend ages love
==80== Security, I’ll pawn my victories, all
==81== My honor to you, upon his good returns.
==82== If by this crime he owes the law his life,
==83== Why, let the war receive’t in valiant gore,
==84== For law is strict, and war is nothing more.

**1. SEN.**
==85== We are for law, he dies, urge it no more
==86== On height of our displeasure. Friend, or brother,
==87== He forfeits his own blood that spills another.

**ALCIB.**
==88== Must it be so? It must not be. My lords,
==89== I do beseech you know me.

**2. SEN.**
==90== How?

**ALCIB.**
==91== Call me to your remembrances.

**3. SEN.**
==91==                   What?

**ALCIB.**
==92== I cannot think but your age has forgot me,
==93== It could not else be I should prove so base
==94== To sue and be denied such common grace.
==95== My wounds ache at you.

**1. SEN.**
==95==               Do you dare our anger?
==96== ’Tis in few words, but spacious in effect:
==97== We banish thee forever.

**ALCIB.**
==97==               Banish me?
==98== Banish your dotage, banish usury,
==99== That makes the Senate ugly!

**1. SEN.**
==100== If after two days’ shine Athens contain thee,
==101== Attend our weightier judgment. And not to swell our spirit,
==102== He shall be executed presently.

*Exeunt Senators.*

**ALCIB.**
==103== Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live
==104== Only in bone, that none may look on you!
==105== I’m worse than mad. I have kept back their foes,
==106== While they have told their money, and let out
==107== Their coin upon large interest—I myself
==108== Rich only in large hurts. All those, for this?
==109== Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate
==110== Pours into captains’ wounds? Banishment!
==111== It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish’d,
==112== It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
==113== That I may strike at Athens. I’ll cheer up
==114== My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
==115== ’Tis honor with most lands to be at odds;
==116== Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.

*Exit.*
