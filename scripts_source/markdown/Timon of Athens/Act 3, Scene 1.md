## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Athens. A room in Lucullus’ house.*

*Flaminius waiting to speak with a lord Lucullus from his master, enters Lucullus’s Servant to him.*

**LUCUL. SERV.**
I have told my lord of you, he is coming down to you.

**FLAM.**
I thank you, sir.

*Enter Lucullus.*

**LUCUL. SERV.**
Here’s my lord.

**LUCUL.**
*(Aside.)*
One of Lord Timon’s men? A gift, I warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver basin and ew’r tonight.—Flaminius, honest Flaminius, you are very respectively welcome, sir. Fill me some wine.
*(Exit Lucullus’s Servant.)*
And how does that honorable, complete, free-hearted gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord and master?

**FLAM.**
His health is well, sir.

**LUCUL.**
I am right glad that his health is well, sir; and what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?

**FLAM.**
Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir, which, in my lord’s behalf, I come to entreat your honor to supply; who, having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to furnish him, nothing doubting your present assistance therein.

**LUCUL.**
La, la, la, la! “nothing doubting,” says he? Alas, good lord! A noble gentleman ’tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha’ din’d with him, and told him on’t, and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty is his. I ha’ told him on’t, but I could ne’er get him from’t.

*Enter Lucullus’s Servant with wine.*

**LUCUL. SERV.**
Please your lordship, here is the wine.

**LUCUL.**
Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here’s to thee.

**FLAM.**
Your lordship speaks your pleasure.

**LUCUL.**
I have observ’d thee always for a towardly prompt spirit—give thee thy due—and one that knows what belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if the time use thee well. Good parts in thee!
*(To Servant.)*
Get you gone, sirrah.
*(Exit Lucullus’s Servant.)*
Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord’s a bountiful gentleman, but thou art wise, and thou know’st well enough (although thou com’st to me) that this is no time to lend money, especially upon bare friendship without security. Here’s three solidares for thee; good boy, wink at me, and say thou saw’st me not. Fare thee well.

**FLAM.**
Is’t possible the world should so much differ,
And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,
To him that worships thee!

*Throwing the money back.*

**LUCUL.**
Ha? Now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.

*Exit Lucullus.*

**FLAM.**
May these add to the number that may scald thee!
Let molten coin be thy damnation,
Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,
It turns in less than two nights? O you gods!
I feel my master’s passion. This slave
Unto his honor has my lord’s meat in him;
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment
When he is turn’d to poison?
O, may diseases only work upon’t!
And when he’s sick to death, let not that part of nature
Which my lord paid for, be of any power
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!

*Exit.*
