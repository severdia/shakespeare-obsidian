## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Athens. A room in a Senator’s house.*

*Enter the Third Senator with papers in his hand.*

**3. SEN.**
==1==And late, five thousand; to Varro and to Isidore
==2==He owes nine thousand, besides my former sum,
==3==Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
==4==Of raging waste? It cannot hold, it will not.
==5==If I want gold, steal but a beggar’s dog
==6==And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
==7==If I would sell my horse and buy twenty more
==8==Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
==9==Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me straight
==10==And able horses. No porter at his gate,
==11==But rather one that smiles and still invites
==12==All that pass by. It cannot hold, no reason
==13==Can sound his state in safety. Caphis ho!
==14==Caphis, I say!

*Enter Caphis.*

**CAPH.**
==14==        Here, sir, what is your pleasure?

**3. SEN.**
==15==Get on your cloak and haste you to Lord Timon;
==16==Importune him for my moneys, be not ceas’d
==17==With slight denial; nor then silenc’d when
==18==“Commend me to your master” and the cap
==19==Plays in the right hand, thus—but tell him
==20==My uses cry to me; I must serve my turn
==21==Out of mine own. His days and times are past,
==22==And my reliances on his fracted dates
==23==Have smit my credit. I love and honor him,
==24==But must not break my back to heal his finger.
==25==Immediate are my needs, and my relief
==26==Must not be toss’d and turn’d to me in words,
==27==But find supply immediate. Get you gone,
==28==Put on a most importunate aspect,
==29==A visage of demand; for I do fear,
==30==When every feather sticks in his own wing,
==31==Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
==32==Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.

**CAPH.**
==33==I go, sir.

**3. SEN.**
==34==Ay, go, sir; take the bonds along with you,
==35==And have the dates in. Come!

**CAPH.**
==35==                I will, sir.

**3. SEN.**
==35==                       Go.

*Exeunt.*
