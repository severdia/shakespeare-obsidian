## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*Athens. A hall in Timon’s house.*

*Enter Varro’s two Servants, meeting Titus and others, all servants of Timon’s creditors, to wait for his coming out. Then enter Lucius’ Servant and Hortensius.*

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==1== Well met, good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.

**TIT.**
==2== The like to you, kind Varro.

**HOR.**
==2==                 Lucius!
==3== What, do we meet together?

**LUC. SERV.**
==3==                 Ay, and I think
==4== One business does command us all; for mine
==5== Is money.

**TIT.**
==6== So is theirs and ours.

*Enter Philotus.*

**LUC. SERV.**
==6==               And, sir, Philotus too!

**PHI.**
==7== Good day at once.

**LUC. SERV.**
==7==            Welcome, good brother.
==8== What do you think the hour?

**PHI.**
==8==                 Laboring for nine.

**LUC. SERV.**
==9== So much?

**PHI.**
==9==     Is not my lord seen yet?

**LUC. SERV.**
==9==                   Not yet.

**PHI.**
==10== I wonder on’t, he was wont to shine at seven.

**LUC. SERV.**
==11== Ay, but the days are wax’d shorter with him.
==12== You must consider that a prodigal course
==13== Is like the sun’s, but not like his recoverable,
==14== I fear. ’Tis deepest winter in Lord Timon’s purse;
==15== That is, one may reach deep enough and yet
==16== Find little.

**PHI.**
==16==         I am of your fear for that.

**TIT.**
==17== I’ll show you how t’ observe a strange event.
==18== Your lord sends now for money.

**HOR.**
==18==                   Most true, he does.

**TIT.**
==19== And he wears jewels now of Timon’s gift,
==20== For which I wait for money.

**HOR.**
==21== It is against my heart.

**LUC. SERV.**
==21==            Mark how strange it shows,
==22== Timon in this should pay more than he owes;
==23== And e’en as if your lord should wear rich jewels
==24== And send for money for ’em.

**HOR.**
==25== I’m weary of this charge, the gods can witness.
==26== I know my lord hath spent of Timon’s wealth,
==27== And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==28== Yes, mine’s three thousand crowns; what’s yours?

**LUC. SERV.**
==29== Five thousand mine.

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==30== ’Tis much deep, and it should seem by th’ sum
==31== Your master’s confidence was above mine,
==32== Else surely his had equall’d.

*Enter Flaminius.*

**TIT.**
==33== One of Lord Timon’s men.

**LUC. SERV.**
==34== Flaminius? Sir, a word. Pray is my lord ready to come forth?

**FLAM.**
==35== No, indeed he is not.

**TIT.**
==36== We attend his lordship; pray signify so much.

**FLAM.**
==37== I need not tell him that, he knows you are too diligent.

*Exit.*

*Enter Steward Flavius in a cloak, muffled.*

**LUC. SERV.**
==38== Ha! Is not that his steward muffled so?
==39== He goes away in a cloud; call him, call him.

**TIT.**
==40== Do you hear, sir?

**2. VAR. SERV.**
==41== By your leave, sir⁠—

**FLAV.**
==42== What do ye ask of me, my friend?

**TIT.**
==43== We wait for certain money here, sir.

**FLAV.**
==43==                      Ay,
==44== If money were as certain as your waiting,
==45== ’Twere sure enough.
==46== Why then preferr’d you not your sums and bills
==47== When your false masters eat of my lord’s meat?
==48== Then they could smile, and fawn upon his debts,
==49== And take down th’ int’rest into their glutt’nous maws.
==50== You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up,
==51== Let me pass quietly.
==52== Believe’t, my lord and I have made an end:
==53== I have no more to reckon, he to spend.

**LUC. SERV.**
==54== Ay, but this answer will not serve.

**FLAV.**
==55== If ’twill not serve, ’tis not so base as you,
==56== For you serve knaves.

*Exit.*

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==57== How? What does his cashier’d worship mutter?

**2. VAR. SERV.**
==58== No matter what, he’s poor, and that’s revenge enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in? Such may rail against great buildings.

*Enter Servilius.*

**TIT.**
==59== O, here’s Servilius; now we shall know some answer.

**SER.**
==60== If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some other hour, I should derive much from’t; for take’t of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to discontent. His comfortable temper has forsook him, he’s much out of health, and keeps his chamber.

**LUC. SERV.**
==61== Many do keep their chambers are not sick;
==62== And if it be so far beyond his health,
==63== Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
==64== And make a clear way to the gods.

**SER.**
==64==                   Good gods!

**TIT.**
==65== We cannot take this for answer, sir.

**FLAM.**
*(Within.)*
==66== Servilius, help! My lord, my lord!

*Enter Timon in a rage, Flaminius following.*

**TIM.**
==67== What, are my doors oppos’d against my passage?
==68== Have I been ever free, and must my house
==69== Be my retentive enemy? My jail?
==70== The place which I have feasted, does it now
==71== (Like all mankind) show me an iron heart?

**LUC. SERV.**
==72== Put in now, Titus.

**TIT.**
==73== My lord, here is my bill.

**LUC. SERV.**
==74== Here’s mine.

**HOR.**
==75== And mine, my lord.

**BOTH 1. VAR. SERV. AND 2. VAR. SERV.**
==76== And ours, my lord.

**PHI.**
==77== All our bills.

**TIM.**
==78== Knock me down with ’em, cleave me to the girdle!

**LUC. SERV.**
==79== Alas, my lord⁠—

**TIM.**
==80== Cut my heart in sums.

**TIT.**
==81== Mine, fifty talents.

**TIM.**
==82== Tell out my blood.

**LUC. SERV.**
==83== Five thousand crowns, my lord.

**TIM.**
==84== Five thousand drops pays that. What yours? And yours?

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==85== My lord⁠—

**2. VAR. SERV.**
==86== My lord⁠—

**TIM.**
==87== Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!

*Exit Timon.*

**HOR.**
==88== Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money. These debts may well be call’d desperate ones, for a madman owes ’em.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Timon and Flavius.*

**TIM.**
==89== They have e’en put my breath from me, the slaves.
==90== Creditors? Devils!

**FLAV.**
==91== My dear lord⁠—

**TIM.**
==92== What if it should be so?

**FLAV.**
==93== My lord⁠—

**TIM.**
==94== I’ll have it so. My steward!

**FLAV.**
==95== Here, my lord.

**TIM.**
==96== So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,
==97== Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius—all.
==98== I’ll once more feast the rascals.

**FLAV.**
==98==                   O my lord,
==99== You only speak from your distracted soul;
==100== There’s not so much left to furnish out
==101== A moderate table.

**TIM.**
==101==            Be it not in thy care;
==102== Go, I charge thee, invite them all, let in the tide
==103== Of knaves once more; my cook and I’ll provide.

*Exeunt.*
