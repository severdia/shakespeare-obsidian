## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Athens. A room in Timon’s house.*

*Enter Steward Flavius with two of Timon’s Servants, Flaminius and Servilius.*

**FLAM.**
==1==Hear you, Master Steward, where’s our master?
==2==Are we undone, cast off, nothing remaining?

**FLAV.**
==3==Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
==4==Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
==5==I am as poor as you.

**FLAM.**
==5==           Such a house broke?
==6==So noble a master fall’n, all gone, and not
==7==One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
==8==And go along with him.

**SER.**
==8==              As we do turn our backs
==9==From our companion thrown into his grave,
==10==So his familiars to his buried fortunes
==11==Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
==12==Like empty purses pick’d; and his poor self,
==13==A dedicated beggar to the air,
==14==With his disease of all-shunn’d poverty,
==15==Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.

*Enter other Servants.*

**FLAV.**
==16==All broken implements of a ruin’d house.

**TIM. SERV.**
==17==Yet do our hearts wear Timon’s livery,
==18==That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,
==19==Serving alike in sorrow. Leak’d is our bark,
==20==And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
==21==Hearing the surges threat; we must all part
==22==Into this sea of air.

**FLAV.**
==22==           Good fellows all,
==23==The latest of my wealth I’ll share amongst you.
==24==Where ever we shall meet, for Timon’s sake
==25==Let’s yet be fellows. Let’s shake our heads, and say,
==26==As ’twere a knell unto our master’s fortunes,
==27==“We have seen better days.” Let each take some;
*(Giving them money.)*
==28==Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
==29==Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
*(Embrace, and part several ways.)*
==30==O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
==31==Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
==32==Since riches point to misery and contempt?
==33==Who would be so mock’d with glory, or to live
==34==But in a dream of friendship,
==35==To have his pomp, and all what state compounds,
==36==But only painted, like his varnish’d friends?
==37==Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
==38==Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
==39==When man’s worst sin is, he does too much good!
==40==Who then dares to be half so kind again?
==41==For bounty, that makes gods, do still mar men.
==42==My dearest lord, blest to be most accurs’d,
==43==Rich only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
==44==Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord,
==45==He’s flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
==46==Of monstrous friends; nor has he with him to
==47==Supply his life, or that which can command it.
==48==I’ll follow and inquire him out.
==49==I’ll ever serve his mind with my best will;
==50==Whilst I have gold, I’ll be his steward still.

*Exit.*
