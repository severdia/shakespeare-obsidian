## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Woods and cave near the seashore.*

*Enter Timon in the woods.*

**TIM.**
==1==O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
==2==Rotten humidity; below thy sister’s orb
==3==Infect the air! Twinn’d brothers of one womb,
==4==Whose procreation, residence, and birth
==5==Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes,
==6==The greater scorns the lesser. Not nature
==7==(To whom all sores lay siege) can bear great fortune
==8==But by contempt of nature.
==9==Raise me this beggar, and deny’t that lord,
==10==The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
==11==The beggar native honor.
==12==It is the paster lards the brother’s sides,
==13==The want that makes him lean. Who dares? Who dares
==14==In purity of manhood stand upright
==15==And say, “This man’s a flatterer”? If one be,
==16==So are they all; for every grize of fortune
==17==Is smooth’d by that below. The learned pate
==18==Ducks to the golden fool. All’s obliquy;
==19==There’s nothing level in our cursed natures
==20==But direct villainy. Therefore be abhorr’d
==21==All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
==22==His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains;
==23==Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
*(Digging.)*
==24==Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
==25==With thy most operant poison! What is here?
==26==Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold?
==27==No, gods, I am no idle votarist;
==28==Roots, you clear heavens! Thus much of this will make
==29==Black white, foul fair, wrong right,
==30==Base noble, old young, coward valiant.
==31==Ha, you gods! Why this? What this, you gods? Why, this
==32==Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
==33==Pluck stout men’s pillows from below their heads.
==34==This yellow slave
==35==Will knit and break religions, bless th’ accurs’d,
==36==Make the hoar leprosy ador’d, place thieves,
==37==And give them title, knee, and approbation
==38==With senators on the bench. This is it
==39==That makes the wappen’d widow wed again;
==40==She, whom the spittle-house and ulcerous sores
==41==Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
==42==To th’ April day again. Come, damn’d earth,
==43==Thou common whore of mankind, that puts odds
==44==Among the rout of nations, I will make thee
==45==Do thy right nature.
*(March afar off.)*
==46==Ha? A drum? Th’ art quick,
==47==But yet I’ll bury thee; thou’t go, strong thief,
==48==When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
==49==Nay, stay thou out for earnest.

*Keeping some gold.*

*Enter Alcibiades, with Drum and Fife, in warlike manner, and Phrynia and Timandra.*

**ALCIB.**
==50==What art thou there? Speak.

**TIM.**
==51==A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
==52==For showing me again the eyes of man!

**ALCIB.**
==53==What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,
==54==That art thyself a man?

**TIM.**
==55==I am *Misanthropos*, and hate mankind.
==56==For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
==57==That I might love thee something.

**ALCIB.**
==57==                  I know thee well;
==58==But in thy fortunes am unlearn’d and strange.

**TIM.**
==59==I know thee too, and more than that I know thee
==60==I not desire to know. Follow thy drum,
==61==With man’s blood paint the ground, gules, gules,
==62==Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
==63==Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
==64==Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
==65==For all her cherubin look.

**PHRY.**
==65==              Thy lips rot off!

**TIM.**
==66==I will not kiss thee, then the rot returns
==67==To thine own lips again.

**ALCIB.**
==68==How came the noble Timon to this change?

**TIM.**
==69==As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
==70==But then renew I could not, like the moon;
==71==There were no suns to borrow of.

**ALCIB.**
==71==                  Noble Timon,
==72==What friendship may I do thee?

**TIM.**
==72==                  None, but to
==73==Maintain my opinion.

**ALCIB.**
==73==           What is it, Timon?

**TIM.**
==74==Promise me friendship, but perform none. If thou wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art a man! If thou dost perform, confound thee, for thou art a man!

**ALCIB.**
==75==I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.

**TIM.**
==76==Thou saw’st them, when I had prosperity.

**ALCIB.**
==77==I see them now, then was a blessed time.

**TIM.**
==78==As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.

**TIMAN.**
==79==Is this th’ Athenian minion, whom the world
==80==Voic’d so regardfully?

**TIM.**
==80==           Art thou Timandra?

**TIMAN.**
==81==Yes.

**TIM.**
==82==Be a whore still. They love thee not that use thee;
==83==Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
==84==Make use of thy salt hours, season the slaves
==85==For tubs and baths, bring down rose-cheek’d youth
==86==To the tub-fast and the diet.

**TIMAN.**
==86==              Hang thee, monster!

**ALCIB.**
==87==Pardon him, sweet Timandra, for his wits
==88==Are drown’d and lost in his calamities.
==89==I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
==90==The want whereof doth daily make revolt
==91==In my penurious band. I have heard, and griev’d,
==92==How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
==93==Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbor states,
==94==But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them⁠—

**TIM.**
==95==I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone.

**ALCIB.**
==96==I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.

**TIM.**
==97==How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
==98==I had rather be alone.

**ALCIB.**
==98==           Why, fare thee well;
==99==Here is some gold for thee.

**TIM.**
==99==              Keep it, I cannot eat it.

**ALCIB.**
==100==When I have laid proud Athens on a heap⁠—

**TIM.**
==101==Warr’st thou ’gainst Athens?

**ALCIB.**
==101==              Ay, Timon, and have cause.

**TIM.**
==102==The gods confound them all in thy conquest,
==103==And thee after, when thou hast conquer’d!

**ALCIB.**
==104==Why me, Timon?

**TIM.**
==104==           That by killing of villains
==105==Thou wast born to conquer my country.
==106==Put up thy gold. Go on—here’s gold—go on;
==107==Be as a planetary plague when Jove
==108==Will o’er some high-vic’d city hang his poison
==109==In the sick air. Let not thy sword skip one.
==110==Pity not honor’d age for his white beard,
==111==He is an usurer. Strike me the counterfeit matron,
==112==It is her habit only that is honest,
==113==Herself’s a bawd. Let not the virgin’s cheek
==114==Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk paps,
==115==That through the window-bars bore at men’s eyes,
==116==Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
==117==But set them down horrible traitors. Spare not the babe,
==118==Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
==119==Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
==120==Hath doubtfully pronounc’d the throat shall cut,
==121==And mince it sans remorse. Swear against objects,
==122==Put armor on thine ears and on thine eyes,
==123==Whose proof nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
==124==Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
==125==Shall pierce a jot. There’s gold to pay thy soldiers,
==126==Make large confusion; and thy fury spent,
==127==Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.

**ALCIB.**
==128==Hast thou gold yet? I’ll take the gold thou givest me,
==129==Not all thy counsel.

**TIM.**
==130==Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven’s curse upon thee!

**BOTH PHRY. AND TIMAN.**
==131==Give us some gold, good Timon; hast thou more?

**TIM.**
==132==Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
==133==And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
==134==Your aprons mountant. You are not oathable,
==135==Although I know you’ll swear, terribly swear
==136==Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
==137==Th’ immortal gods that hear you. Spare your oaths;
==138==I’ll trust to your conditions, be whores still.
==139==And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
==140==Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up,
==141==Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
==142==And be no turncoats; yet may your pains six months
==143==Be quite contrary. And thatch your poor thin roofs
==144==With burdens of the dead—some that were hang’d,
==145==No matter; wear them, betray with them. Whore still,
==146==Paint till a horse may mire upon your face:
==147==A pox of wrinkles!

**BOTH PHRY. AND TIMAN.**
==147==           Well, more gold—what then?
==148==Believe’t that we’ll do any thing for gold.

**TIM.**
==149==Consumptions sow
==150==In hollow bones of man, strike their sharp shins,
==151==And mar men’s spurring. Crack the lawyer’s voice,
==152==That he may never more false title plead,
==153==Nor sound his quillets shrilly; hoar the flamen,
==154==That scolds against the quality of flesh
==155==And not believes himself. Down with the nose,
==156==Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
==157==Of him that, his particular to foresee,
==158==Smells from the general weal. Make curl’d-pate ruffians bald,
==159==And let the unscarr’d braggarts of the war
==160==Derive some pain from you. Plague all,
==161==That your activity may defeat and quell
==162==The source of all erection. There’s more gold.
==163==Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
==164==And ditches grave you all!

**BOTH PHRY. AND TIMAN.**
==165==More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.

**TIM.**
==166==More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.

**ALCIB.**
==167==Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon!
==168==If I thrive well, I’ll visit thee again.

**TIM.**
==169==If I hope well, I’ll never see thee more.

**ALCIB.**
==170==I never did thee harm.

**TIM.**
==171==Yes, thou spok’st well of me.

**ALCIB.**
==171==                Call’st thou that harm?

**TIM.**
==172==Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
==173==Thy beagles with thee.

**ALCIB.**
==173==           We but offend him. Strike!

*Drum beats. Exeunt Alcibiades, Phrynia, and Timandra.*

**TIM.**
==174==That nature being sick of man’s unkindness
==175==Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou
*(Digging.)*
==176==Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast
==177==Teems and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
==178==Whereof thy proud child (arrogant man) is puff’d,
==179==Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
==180==The gilded newt and eyeless venom’d worm,
==181==With all th’ abhorred births below crisp heaven
==182==Whereon Hyperion’s quick’ning fire doth shine:
==183==Yield him who all the human sons do hate,
==184==From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
==185==Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
==186==Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
==187==Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears,
==188==Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face
==189==Hath to the marbled mansion all above
==190==Never presented!—O, a root, dear thanks!⁠—
==191==Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas,
==192==Whereof ingrateful man, with liquorish draughts
==193==And morsels unctious, greases his pure mind,
==194==That from it all consideration slips⁠—
*(Enter Apemantus.)*
==195==More man? Plague, plague!

**APEM.**
==196==I was directed hither. Men report
==197==Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.

**TIM.**
==198==’Tis then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
==199==Whom I would imitate. Consumption catch thee!

**APEM.**
==200==This is in thee a nature but infected,
==201==A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
==202==From change of future. Why this spade? This place?
==203==This slave-like habit? And these looks of care?
==204==Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft,
==205==Hug their diseas’d perfumes, and have forgot
==206==That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods
==207==By putting on the cunning of a carper.
==208==Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
==209==By that which has undone thee; hinge thy knee,
==210==And let his very breath whom thou’lt observe
==211==Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
==212==And call it excellent. Thou wast told thus;
==213==Thou gav’st thine ears (like tapsters that bade welcome) 
==214==To knaves and all approachers. ’Tis most just
==215==That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
==216==Rascals should have’t. Do not assume my likeness.

**TIM.**
==217==Were I like thee, I’d throw away myself.

**APEM.**
==218==Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself,
==219==A madman so long, now a fool. What, think’st
==220==That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
==221==Will put thy shirt on warm? Will these moist trees,
==222==That have outliv’d the eagle, page thy heels
==223==And skip when thou point’st out? Will the cold brook,
==224==Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste
==225==To cure thy o’ernight’s surfeit? Call the creatures
==226==Whose naked natures live in all the spite
==227==Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
==228==To the conflicting elements expos’d,
==229==Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee.
==230==O, thou shalt find⁠—

**TIM.**
==230==           A fool of thee. Depart.

**APEM.**
==231==I love thee better now than e’er I did.

**TIM.**
==232==I hate thee worse.

**APEM.**
==232==           Why?

**TIM.**
==232==                Thou flatter’st misery.

**APEM.**
==233==I flatter not, but say thou art a caitiff.

**TIM.**
==234==Why dost thou seek me out?

**APEM.**
==234==                To vex thee.

**TIM.**
==235==Always a villain’s office, or a fool’s.
==236==Dost please thyself in’t?

**APEM.**
==236==              Ay.

**TIM.**
==236==                What, a knave too?

**APEM.**
==237==If thou didst put this sour cold habit on
==238==To castigate thy pride, ’twere well; but thou
==239==Dost it enforcedly. Thou’dst courtier be again,
==240==Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
==241==Outlives incertain pomp, is crown’d before:
==242==The one is filling still, never complete;
==243==The other, at high wish. Best state, contentless,
==244==Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
==245==Worse than the worst, content.
==246==Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.

**TIM.**
==247==Not by his breath that is more miserable.
==248==Thou art a slave, whom Fortune’s tender arm
==249==With favor never clasp’d, but bred a dog.
==250==Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
==251==The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
==252==To such as may the passive drugs of it
==253==Freely command, thou wouldst have plung’d thyself
==254==In general riot, melted down thy youth
==255==In different beds of lust, and never learn’d
==256==The icy precepts of respect, but followed
==257==The sug’red game before thee. But myself,
==258==Who had the world as my confectionary,
==259==The mouths, the tongues, the eyes, and hearts of men
==260==At duty, more than I could frame employment;
==261==That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
==262==Do on the oak, have with one winter’s brush
==263==Fell from their boughs, and left me open, bare,
==264==For every storm that blows—I to bear this,
==265==That never knew but better, is some burden:
==266==Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
==267==Hath made thee hard in’t. Why shouldst thou hate men?
==268==They never flatter’d thee. What hast thou given?
==269==If thou wilt curse, thy father (that poor rag) 
==270==Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
==271==To some she-beggar and compounded thee
==272==Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
==273==If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
==274==Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

**APEM.**
==274==                     Art thou proud yet?

**TIM.**
==275==Ay, that I am not thee.

**APEM.**
==275==              I, that I was
==276==No prodigal.

**TIM.**
==276==        I, that I am one now.
==277==Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
==278==I’ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
==279==That the whole life of Athens were in this!
==280==Thus would I eat it.

*Eating a root.*

**APEM.**
==280==           Here, I will mend thy feast.

*Offering him another.*

**TIM.**
==281==First mend my company, take away thyself.

**APEM.**
==282==So I shall mend mine own, by th’ lack of thine.

**TIM.**
==283==’Tis not well mended so, it is but botch’d;
==284==If not, I would it were.

**APEM.**
==285==What wouldst thou have to Athens?

**TIM.**
==286==Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
==287==Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.

**APEM.**
==288==Here is no use for gold.

**TIM.**
==288==              The best, and truest;
==289==For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.

**APEM.**
==290==Where liest a’ nights, Timon?

**TIM.**
==290==                Under that’s above me.
==291==Where feed’st thou a’ days, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==292==Where my stomach finds meat, or, rather, where I eat it.

**TIM.**
==293==Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!

**APEM.**
==294==Where wouldst thou send it?

**TIM.**
==295==To sauce thy dishes.

**APEM.**
==296==The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the extremity of both ends. When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume, they mock’d thee for too much curiosity; in thy rags thou know’st none, but art despis’d for the contrary. There’s a medlar for thee, eat it.

**TIM.**
==297==On what I hate I feed not.

**APEM.**
==298==Dost hate a medlar?

**TIM.**
==299==Ay, though it look like thee.

**APEM.**
==300==And th’ hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst have lov’d thyself better now. What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was belov’d after his means?

**TIM.**
==301==Who, without those means thou talk’st of, didst thou ever know belov’d?

**APEM.**
==302==Myself.

**TIM.**
==303==I understand thee: thou hadst some means to keep a dog.

**APEM.**
==304==What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers?

**TIM.**
==305==Women nearest, but men—men are the things themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world, Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?

**APEM.**
==306==Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.

**TIM.**
==307==Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men, and remain a beast with the beasts?

**APEM.**
==308==Ay, Timon.

**TIM.**
==309==A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t’ attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would eat thee; if thou wert the fox, the lion would suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accus’d by the ass; if thou wert the ass, thy dullness would torment thee, and still thou liv’dst but as a breakfast to the wolf; if thou wert the wolf, thy greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner; wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury; wert thou a bear, thou wouldst be kill’d by the horse; wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seiz’d by the leopard; wert thou a leopard, thou wert germane to the lion, and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life; all thy safety were remotion and thy defense absence. What beast couldst thou be, that were not subject to a beast? And what a beast art thou already, that seest not thy loss in transformation!

**APEM.**
==310==If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou mightst have hit upon it here. The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts.

**TIM.**
==311==How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?

**APEM.**
==312==Yonder comes a poet and a painter; the plague of company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it, and give way. When I know not what else to do, I’ll see thee again.

**TIM.**
==313==When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be welcome. I had rather be a beggar’s dog than Apemantus.

**APEM.**
==314==Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.

**TIM.**
==315==Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!

**APEM.**
==316==A plague on thee, thou art too bad to curse!

**TIM.**
==317==All villains that do stand by thee are pure.

**APEM.**
==318==There is no leprosy but what thou speak’st.

**TIM.**
==319==If I name thee.
==320==I’ll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.

**APEM.**
==321==I would my tongue could rot them off!

**TIM.**
==322==Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
==323==Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
==324==I swound to see thee.

**APEM.**
==325==Would thou wouldst burst!

**TIM.**
==325==              Away, thou tedious rogue!
==326==I am sorry I shall lose a stone by thee.

*Throws a stone at him.*

**APEM.**
==327==Beast!

**TIM.**
==328==Slave!

**APEM.**
==329==Toad!

**TIM.**
==330==Rogue, rogue, rogue!
==331==I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
==332==But even the mere necessities upon’t.
==333==Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
==334==Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat
==335==Thy grave-stone daily; make thine epitaph,
==336==That death in me at others’ lives may laugh.
*(To the gold.)*
==337==O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
==338==’Twixt natural son and sire! Thou bright defiler
==339==Of Hymen’s purest bed! Thou valiant Mars!
==340==Thou ever young, fresh, lov’d, and delicate wooer,
==341==Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
==342==That lies on Dian’s lap! Thou visible god,
==343==That sold’rest close impossibilities,
==344==And mak’st them kiss! That speak’st with every tongue
==345==To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts,
==346==Think thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
==347==Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
==348==May have the world in empire!

**APEM.**
==348==                  Would ’twere so!
==349==But not till I am dead. I’ll say th’ hast gold;
==350==Thou wilt be throng’d to shortly.

**TIM.**
==350==                Throng’d to?

**APEM.**
==350==                         Ay.

**TIM.**
==351==Thy back, I prithee.

**APEM.**
==351==           Live, and love thy misery.

**TIM.**
==352==Long live so, and so die. I am quit.

**APEM.**
==353==More things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.

*Exit Apemantus.*

*Enter the Bandits.*

**1. BAN.**
==354==Where should he have this gold? It is some poor fragment, some slender ort of his remainder. The mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his friends, drove him into this melancholy.

**2. BAN.**
==355==It is nois’d he hath a mass of treasure.

**3. BAN.**
==356==Let us make the assay upon him. If he care not for’t, he will supply us easily; if he covetously reserve it, how shall ’s get it?

**2. BAN.**
==357==True; for he bears it not about him, ’tis hid.

**1. BAN.**
==358==Is not this he?

**ALL OTHER BAN.**
==359==Where?

**2. BAN.**
==360==’Tis his description.

**3. BAN.**
==361==He; I know him.

**ALL OTHER BAN.**
==362==’Save thee, Timon.

**TIM.**
==363==Now, thieves?

**ALL OTHER BAN.**
==364==Soldiers, not thieves.

**TIM.**
==365==Both too, and women’s sons.

**ALL BAN.**
==366==We are not thieves, but men that much do want.

**TIM.**
==367==Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
==368==Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
==369==Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
==370==The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet heps;
==371==The bounteous huswife Nature on each bush
==372==Lays her full mess before you. Want? Why want?

**1. BAN.**
==373==We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
==374==As beasts and birds and fishes.

**TIM.**
==375==Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds and fishes;
==376==You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
==377==That you are thieves profess’d, that you work not
==378==In holier shapes; for there is boundless theft
==379==In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
==380==Here’s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o’ th’ grape,
==381==Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
==382==And so scape hanging. Trust not the physician,
==383==His antidotes are poison, and he slays
==384==More than you rob. Take wealth and lives together,
==385==Do, villains, do, since you protest to do’t.
==386==Like workmen, I’ll example you with thievery:
==387==The sun’s a thief, and with his great attraction
==388==Robs the vast sea; the moon’s an arrant thief,
==389==And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;
==390==The sea’s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
==391==The moon into salt tears; the earth’s a thief,
==392==That feeds and breeds by a composture stol’n
==393==From gen’ral excrement; each thing’s a thief.
==394==The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
==395==Has uncheck’d theft. Love not yourselves, away,
==396==Rob one another. There’s more gold. Cut throats,
==397==All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,
==398==Break open shops; nothing can you steal
==399==But thieves do lose it. Steal less for this I give you,
==400==And gold confound you howsoe’er! Amen.

**3. BAN.**
==401==H’as almost charm’d me from my profession, by persuading me to it.

**1. BAN.**
==402==’Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us, not to have us thrive in our mystery.

**2. BAN.**
==403==I’ll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.

**1. BAN.**
==404==Let us first see peace in Athens. There is no time so miserable but a man may be true.

*Exeunt Thieves, the Bandits.*

*Enter the Steward Flavius to Timon.*

**FLAV.**
==405==O you gods!
==406==Is yond despis’d and ruinous man my lord?
==407==Full of decay and failing? O monument
==408==And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow’d!
==409==What an alteration of honor has desp’rate want made!
==410==What vilder thing upon the earth than friends,
==411==Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
==412==How rarely does it meet with this time’s guise,
==413==When man was wish’d to love his enemies!
==414==Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
==415==Those that would mischief me than those that do!
==416==H’as caught me in his eye, I will present
==417==My honest grief unto him; and as my lord,
==418==Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!

**TIM.**
==419==Away! What art thou?

**FLAV.**
==419==           Have you forgot me, sir?

**TIM.**
==420==Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men.
==421==Then, if thou grant’st th’ art a man, I have forgot thee.

**FLAV.**
==422==An honest poor servant of yours.

**TIM.**
==423==Then I know thee not.
==424==I never had honest man about me, I; all
==425==I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.

**FLAV.**
==426==The gods are witness,
==427==Nev’r did poor steward wear a truer grief
==428==For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.

**TIM.**
==429==What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I love thee,
==430==Because thou art a woman, and disclaim’st
==431==Flinty mankind, whose eyes do never give
==432==But thorough lust and laughter. Pity’s sleeping:
==433==Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!

**FLAV.**
==434==I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
==435==T’ accept my grief, and whilst this poor wealth lasts
==436==To entertain me as your steward still.

**TIM.**
==437==Had I a steward
==438==So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
==439==It almost turns my dangerous nature wild.
==440==Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
==441==Was born of woman.
==442==Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
==443==You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
==444==One honest man—mistake me not, but one;
==445==No more, I pray—and he’s a steward.
==446==How fain would I have hated all mankind,
==447==And thou redeem’st thyself. But all, save thee,
==448==I fell with curses.
==449==Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
==450==For, by oppressing and betraying me,
==451==Thou mightst have sooner got another service;
==452==For many so arrive at second masters,
==453==Upon their first lord’s neck. But tell me true
==454==(For I must ever doubt, though ne’er so sure),
==455==Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
==456==If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
==457==Expecting in return twenty for one?

**FLAV.**
==458==No, my most worthy master, in whose breast
==459==Doubt and suspect, alas, are plac’d too late;
==460==You should have fear’d false times when you did feast:
==461==Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
==462==That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
==463==Duty, and zeal to your unmatched mind,
==464==Care of your food and living; and believe it,
==465==My most honor’d lord,
==466==For any benefit that points to me,
==467==Either in hope or present, I’d exchange
==468==For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
==469==To requite me by making rich yourself.

**TIM.**
==470==Look thee, ’tis so. Thou singly honest man,
==471==Here, take; the gods out of my misery
==472==Has sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy,
==473==But thus condition’d: thou shalt build from men;
==474==Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
==475==But let the famish’d flesh slide from the bone
==476==Ere thou relieve the beggar. Give to dogs
==477==What thou deniest to men. Let prisons swallow ’em,
==478==Debts wither ’em to nothing; be men like blasted woods,
==479==And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
==480==And so farewell and thrive.

**FLAV.**
==480==              O, let me stay,
==481==And comfort you, my master.

**TIM.**
==481==                If thou hat’st curses,
==482==Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free.
==483==Ne’er see thou man, and let me ne’er see thee.

*Exeunt severally.*
