## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Outside the walls of Athens.*

*Enter Timon.*

**TIM.**
==1==Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall
==2==That girdles in those wolves, dive in the earth,
==3==And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
==4==Obedience, fail in children! Slaves and fools,
==5==Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench,
==6==And minister in their steads! To general filths
==7==Convert o’ th’ instant, green virginity!
==8==Do’t in your parents’ eyes! Bankrupts, hold fast;
==9==Rather than render back, out with your knives,
==10==And cut your trusters’ throats! Bound servants, steal;
==11==Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
==12==And pill by law. Maid, to thy master’s bed,
==13==Thy mistress is o’ th’ brothel! Son of sixteen,
==14==Pluck the lin’d crutch from thy old limping sire,
==15==With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
==16==Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
==17==Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighborhood,
==18==Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
==19==Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
==20==Decline to your confounding contraries;
==21==And yet confusion live! Plagues incident to men,
==22==Your potent and infectious fevers heap
==23==On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
==24==Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
==25==As lamely as their manners! Lust, and liberty,
==26==Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
==27==That ’gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
==28==And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
==29==Sow all th’ Athenian bosoms, and their crop
==30==Be general leprosy! Breath, infect breath,
==31==That their society (as their friendship) may
==32==Be merely poison! Nothing I’ll bear from thee
==33==But nakedness, thou detestable town!
==34==Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
==35==Timon will to the woods, where he shall find
==36==Th’ unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
==37==The gods confound (hear me, you good gods all) 
==38==Th’ Athenians both within and out that wall!
==39==And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
==40==To the whole race of mankind, high and low!
==41==Amen.

*Exit.*
