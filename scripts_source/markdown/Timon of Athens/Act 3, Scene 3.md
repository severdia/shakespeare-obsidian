## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Athens. A room in Sempronius’s house.*

*Enter Timon’s Servant with Sempronius, another of Timon’s friends.*

**SEM.**
==1== Must he needs trouble me in’t—hum!—’bove all others?
==2== He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
==3== And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
==4== Whom he redeem’d from prison. All these
==5== Owes their estates unto him.

**TIM. SERV.**
==5==                 My lord,
==6== They have all been touch’d and found base metal,
==7== For they have all denied him.

**SEM.**
==7==                 How? Have they denied him?
==8== Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him,
==9== And does he send to me? Three? Humh!
==10== It shows but little love or judgment in him.
==11== Must I be his last refuge? His friends, like physicians,
==12== Thrive, give him over; must I take th’ cure upon me?
==13== H’as much disgrac’d me in’t, I’m angry at him,
==14== That might have known my place. I see no sense for’t,
==15== But his occasions might have wooed me first;
==16== For, in my conscience, I was the first man
==17== That e’er received gift from him;
==18== And does he think so backwardly of me now,
==19== That I’ll requite it last? No!
==20== So it may prove an argument of laughter
==21== To th’ rest, and ’mongst lords I be thought a fool.
==22== I’d rather than the worth of thrice the sum
==23== H’ad sent to me first, but for my mind’s sake;
==24== I’d such a courage to do him good. But now return,
==25== And with their faint reply this answer join:
==26== Who bates mine honor shall not know my coin.

*Exit.*

**TIM. SERV.**
==27== Excellent! Your lordship’s a goodly villain. The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic; he cross’d himself by’t; and I cannot think but, in the end, the villainies of man will set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to appear foul! Takes virtuous copies to be wicked; like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire; of such a nature is his politic love.
==28== This was my lord’s best hope, now all are fled,
==29== Save only the gods. Now his friends are dead,
==30== Doors, that were ne’er acquainted with their wards
==31== Many a bounteous year, must be employ’d
==32== Now to guard sure their master.
==33== And this is all a liberal course allows:
==34== Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.

*Exit.*
