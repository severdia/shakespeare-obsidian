## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The woods. A rude tomb near Timon’s cave.*

*Enter a Soldier in the woods, seeking Timon. A rude tomb seen.*

**SOLD.**
By all description this should be the place.
Who’s here? Speak ho! No answer? What is this?
*(Reads.)*
*“Timon is dead, who hath outstretch’d his span:*
*Some beast read this; there does not live a man.”*
Dead, sure, and this his grave. What’s on this tomb
I cannot read; the character I’ll take with wax;
Our captain hath in every figure skill,
An ag’d interpreter, though young in days.
Before proud Athens he’s set down by this,
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.

*Exit.*
