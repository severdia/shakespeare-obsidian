## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Athens. A hall in Timon’s house.*

*Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweler, Merchant, at several doors.*

**POET.**
==1== Good day, sir.

**PAIN.**
==1==         I am glad y’ are well.

**POET.**
==2== I have not seen you long, how goes the world?

**PAIN.**
==3== It wears, sir, as it grows.

**POET.**
==3==               Ay, that’s well known;
==4== But what particular rarity? What strange,
==5== Which manifold record not matches? See,
==6== Magic of bounty! All these spirits thy power
==7== Hath conjur’d to attend. I know the merchant.

**PAIN.**
==8== I know them both; th’ other’s a jeweler.

**MER.**
==9== O, ’tis a worthy lord.

**JEW.**
==9==            Nay, that’s most fix’d.

**MER.**
==10== A most incomparable man, breath’d, as it were,
==11== To an untirable and continuate goodness;
==12== He passes.

**JEW.**
==13== I have a jewel here⁠—

**MER.**
==14== O, pray let’s see’t. For the Lord Timon, sir?

**JEW.**
==15== If he will touch the estimate. But for that⁠—

**POET.**
*(Reciting to himself.)*
==16== “When we for recompense have prais’d the vild,
==17== It stains the glory in that happy verse
==18== Which aptly sings the good.”

**MER.**
*(Looking on the jewel.)*
==18==                 ’Tis a good form.

**JEW.**
==19== And rich. Here is a water, look ye.

**PAIN.**
==20== You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
==21== To the great lord.

**POET.**
==21==            A thing slipp’d idlely from me.
==22== Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
==23== From whence ’tis nourish’d. The fire i’ th’ flint
==24== Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
==25== Provokes itself and like the current flies
==26== Each bound it chases. What have you there?

**PAIN.**
==27== A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?

**POET.**
==28== Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
==29== Let’s see your piece.

**PAIN.**
==29==            ’Tis a good piece.

**POET.**
==30== So ’tis. This comes off well and excellent.

**PAIN.**
==31== Indifferent.

**POET.**
==31==         Admirable! How this grace
==32== Speaks his own standing! What a mental power
==33== This eye shoots forth! How big imagination
==34== Moves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture
==35== One might interpret.

**PAIN.**
==36== It is a pretty mocking of the life.
==37== Here is a touch; is’t good?

**POET.**
==37==               I will say of it,
==38== It tutors nature. Artificial strife
==39== Lives in these touches, livelier than life.

*Enter certain Senators and pass over.*

**PAIN.**
==40== How this lord is followed!

**POET.**
==41== The senators of Athens, happy men!

**PAIN.**
==42== Look, more!

**POET.**
==43== You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.
==44== I have, in this rough work, shap’d out a man
==45== Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
==46== With amplest entertainment. My free drift
==47== Halts not particularly, but moves itself
==48== In a wide sea of wax; no levell’d malice
==49== Infects one comma in the course I hold,
==50== But flies an eagle flight, bold, and forth on,
==51== Leaving no tract behind.

**PAIN.**
==52== How shall I understand you?

**POET.**
==52==                 I will unbolt to you.
==53== You see how all conditions, how all minds,
==54== As well of glib and slipp’ry creatures as
==55== Of grave and austere quality, tender down
==56== Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,
==57== Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,
==58== Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
==59== All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac’d flatterer
==60== To Apemantus, that few things loves better
==61== Than to abhor himself; even he drops down
==62== The knee before him, and returns in peace
==63== Most rich in Timon’s nod.

**PAIN.**
==63==               I saw them speak together.

**POET.**
==64== Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
==65== Feign’d Fortune to be thron’d. The base o’ th’ mount
==66== Is rank’d with all deserts, all kind of natures,
==67== That labor on the bosom of this sphere
==68== To propagate their states. Amongst them all,
==69== Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix’d,
==70== One do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame,
==71== Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,
==72== Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
==73== Translates his rivals.

**PAIN.**
==73==            ’Tis conceiv’d to scope.
==74== This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
==75== With one man beckon’d from the rest below,
==76== Bowing his head against the steepy mount
==77== To climb his happiness, would be well express’d
==78== In our condition.

**POET.**
==78==            Nay, sir, but hear me on:
==79== All those which were his fellows but of late⁠—
==80== Some better than his value—on the moment
==81== Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
==82== Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
==83== Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
==84== Drink the free air.

**PAIN.**
==84==            Ay, marry, what of these?

**POET.**
==85== When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
==86== Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependents
==87== Which labor’d after him to the mountain’s top
==88== Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
==89== Not one accompanying his declining foot.

**PAIN.**
==90== ’Tis common:
==91== A thousand moral paintings I can show
==92== That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s
==93== More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
==94== To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
==95== The foot above the head.

*Trumpets sound. Enter Lord Timon, addressing himself courteously to every suitor, a Messenger from Ventidius talking with him; Lucilius and other Servants following.*

**TIM.**
==95==               Imprison’d is he, say you?

**MESS. VENT.**
==96== Ay, my good lord, five talents is his debt,
==97== His means most short, his creditors most strait.
==98== Your honorable letter he desires
==99== To those have shut him up, which failing,
==100== Periods his comfort.

**TIM.**
==100==            Noble Ventidius! Well;
==101== I am not of that feather to shake off
==102== My friend when he must need me. I do know him
==103== A gentleman that well deserves a help,
==104== Which he shall have. I’ll pay the debt and free him.

**MESS. VENT.**
==105== Your lordship ever binds him.

**TIM.**
==106== Commend me to him. I will send his ransom,
==107== And being enfranchis’d, bid him come to me;
==108== ’Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
==109== But to support him after. Fare you well.

**MESS. VENT.**
==110== All happiness to your honor!

*Exit.*

*Enter an Old Athenian.*

**OLD ATH.**
==111== Lord Timon, hear me speak.

**TIM.**
==111==                 Freely, good father.

**OLD ATH.**
==112== Thou hast a servant nam’d Lucilius.

**TIM.**
==113== I have so. What of him?

**OLD ATH.**
==114== Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.

**TIM.**
==115== Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!

**LUCIL.**
==116== Here, at your lordship’s service.

**OLD ATH.**
==117== This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
==118== By night frequents my house. I am a man
==119== That from my first have been inclin’d to thrift,
==120== And my estate deserves an heir more rais’d
==121== Than one which holds a trencher.

**TIM.**
==121==                   Well; what further?

**OLD ATH.**
==122== One only daughter have I, no kin else,
==123== On whom I may confer what I have got.
==124== The maid is fair, a’ th’ youngest for a bride,
==125== And I have bred her at my dearest cost
==126== In qualities of the best. This man of thine
==127== Attempts her love. I prithee, noble lord,
==128== Join with me to forbid him her resort,
==129== Myself have spoke in vain.

**TIM.**
==129==               The man is honest.

**OLD ATH.**
==130== Therefore he will be, Timon.
==131== His honesty rewards him in itself,
==132== It must not bear my daughter.

**TIM.**
==132==                 Does she love him?

**OLD ATH.**
==133== She is young and apt.
==134== Our own precedent passions do instruct us
==135== What levity’s in youth.

**TIM.**
*(To Lucilius.)*
==135==               Love you the maid?

**LUCIL.**
==136== Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.

**OLD ATH.**
==137== If in her marriage my consent be missing,
==138== I call the gods to witness, I will choose
==139== Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
==140== And dispossess her all.

**TIM.**
==140==            How shall she be endowed,
==141== If she be mated with an equal husband?

**OLD ATH.**
==142== Three talents on the present; in future, all.

**TIM.**
==143== This gentleman of mine hath serv’d me long;
==144== To build his fortune I will strain a little,
==145== For ’tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter;
==146== What you bestow, in him I’ll counterpoise,
==147== And make him weigh with her.

**OLD ATH.**
==147==                 Most noble lord,
==148== Pawn me to this your honor, she is his.

**TIM.**
==149== My hand to thee, mine honor on my promise.

**LUCIL.**
==150== Humbly I thank your lordship. Never may
==151== That state or fortune fall into my keeping,
==152== Which is not owed to you!

*Exit with Old Athenian.*

**POET.**
==153== Vouchsafe my labor, and long live your lordship!

**TIM.**
==154== I thank you, you shall hear from me anon.
==155== Go not away. What have you there, my friend?

**PAIN.**
==156== A piece of painting, which I do beseech
==157== Your lordship to accept.

**TIM.**
==157==               Painting is welcome.
==158== The painting is almost the natural man;
==159== For since dishonor traffics with man’s nature,
==160== He is but outside; these pencill’d figures are
==161== Even such as they give out. I like your work,
==162== And you shall find I like it. Wait attendance
==163== Till you hear further from me.

**PAIN.**
==163==                 The gods preserve ye!

**TIM.**
==164== Well fare you, gentleman; give me your hand,
==165== We must needs dine together.—Sir, your jewel
==166== Hath suffered under praise.

**JEW.**
==166==               What, my lord, dispraise?

**TIM.**
==167== A mere satiety of commendations;
==168== If I should pay you for’t as ’tis extoll’d,
==169== It would unclew me quite.

**JEW.**
==169==               My lord, ’tis rated
==170== As those which sell would give; but you well know,
==171== Things of like value differing in the owners
==172== Are prized by their masters. Believe’t, dear lord,
==173== You mend the jewel by the wearing it.

**TIM.**
==174== Well mock’d.

*Enter Apemantus.*

**MER.**
==175== No, my good lord, he speaks the common tongue
==176== Which all men speak with him.

**TIM.**
==177== Look who comes here; will you be chid?

**JEW.**
==178== We’ll bear, with your lordship.

**MER.**
==178==                 He’ll spare none.

**TIM.**
==179== Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!

**APEM.**
==180== Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow⁠—
==181== When thou art Timon’s dog, and these knaves honest.

**TIM.**
==182== Why dost thou call them knaves? Thou know’st them not.

**APEM.**
==183== Are they not Athenians?

**TIM.**
==184== Yes.

**APEM.**
==185== Then I repent not.

**JEW.**
==186== You know me, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==187== Thou know’st I do, I call’d thee by thy name.

**TIM.**
==188== Thou art proud, Apemantus.

**APEM.**
==189== Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.

**TIM.**
==190== Whither art going?

**APEM.**
==191== To knock out an honest Athenian’s brains.

**TIM.**
==192== That’s a deed thou’t die for.

**APEM.**
==193== Right, if doing nothing be death by th’ law.

**TIM.**
==194== How lik’st thou this picture, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==195== The best, for the innocence.

**TIM.**
==196== Wrought he not well that painted it?

**APEM.**
==197== He wrought better that made the painter, and yet he’s but a filthy piece of work.

**PAIN.**
==198== Y’ are a dog.

**APEM.**
==199== Thy mother’s of my generation; what’s she, if I be a dog?

**TIM.**
==200== Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==201== No; I eat not lords.

**TIM.**
==202== And thou shouldst, thou’dst anger ladies.

**APEM.**
==203== O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.

**TIM.**
==204== That’s a lascivious apprehension.

**APEM.**
==205== So thou apprehend’st it, take it for thy labor.

**TIM.**
==206== How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==207== Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cast a man a doit.

**TIM.**
==208== What dost thou think ’tis worth?

**APEM.**
==209== Not worth my thinking. How now, poet?

**POET.**
==210== How now, philosopher?

**APEM.**
==211== Thou liest.

**POET.**
==212== Art not one?

**APEM.**
==213== Yes.

**POET.**
==214== Then I lie not.

**APEM.**
==215== Art not a poet?

**POET.**
==216== Yes.

**APEM.**
==217== Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou hast feign’d him a worthy fellow.

**POET.**
==218== That’s not feign’d, he is so.

**APEM.**
==219== Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy labor. He that loves to be flatter’d is worthy o’ th’ flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!

**TIM.**
==220== What wouldst do then, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==221== E’en as Apemantus does now: hate a lord with my heart.

**TIM.**
==222== What, thyself?

**APEM.**
==223== Ay.

**TIM.**
==224== Wherefore?

**APEM.**
==225== That I had no angry wit to be a lord. Art not thou a merchant?

**MER.**
==226== Ay, Apemantus.

**APEM.**
==227== Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!

**MER.**
==228== If traffic do it, the gods do it.

**APEM.**
==229== Traffic’s thy god, and thy god confound thee!

*Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger.*

**TIM.**
==230== What trumpet’s that?

**MESS.**
==231== ’Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
==232== All of companionship.

**TIM.**
==233== Pray entertain them, give them guide to us.
*(Exeunt some Attendants.)*
==234== You must needs dine with me; go not you hence
==235== Till I have thank’d you. When dinner’s done,
==236== Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
*(Enter Alcibiades with the rest.)*
==237== Most welcome, sir!

**APEM.**
==237==            So, so; there!
==238== Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
==239== That there should be small love amongest these sweet knaves,
==240== And all this courtesy! The strain of man’s bred out
==241== Into baboon and monkey.

**ALCIB.**
==242== Sir, you have sav’d my longing, and I feed
==243== Most hungerly on your sight.

**TIM.**
==243==                 Right welcome, sir!
==244== Ere we depart, we’ll share a bounteous time
==245== In different pleasures. Pray you let us in.

*Exeunt all but Apemantus.*

*Enter two Lords.*

**1. LORD.**
==246== What time a’ day is’t, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==247== Time to be honest.

**1. LORD.**
==248== That time serves still.

**APEM.**
==249== The most accursed thou, that still omit’st it.

**2. LORD.**
==250== Thou art going to Lord Timon’s feast?

**APEM.**
==251== Ay, to see meat fill knaves, and wine heat fools.

**2. LORD.**
==252== Fare thee well, fare thee well.

**APEM.**
==253== Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.

**2. LORD.**
==254== Why, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==255== Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to give thee none.

**1. LORD.**
==256== Hang thyself!

**APEM.**
==257== No, I will do nothing at thy bidding; make thy requests to thy friend.

**2. LORD.**
==258== Away, unpeaceable dog, or I’ll spurn thee hence!

**APEM.**
==259== I will fly, like a dog, the heels a’ th’ ass.

*Exit.*

**1. LORD.**
==260== He’s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in
==261== And taste Lord Timon’s bounty? He outgoes
==262== The very heart of kindness.

**2. LORD.**
==263== He pours it out: Plutus, the god of gold,
==264== Is but his steward. No meed but he repays
==265== Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him
==266== But breeds the giver a return exceeding
==267== All use of quittance.

**1. LORD.**
==267==            The noblest mind he carries
==268== That ever govern’d man.

**2. LORD.**
==269== Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?

**1. LORD.**
==270== I’ll keep you company.

*Exeunt.*
