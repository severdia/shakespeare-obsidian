## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*The woods. Before Timon’s cave.*

*Enter Poet and Painter; Timon watching them from his cave.*

**PAIN.**
==1== As I took note of the place, it cannot be far
==2== Where he abides.

**POET.**
==2==            What’s to be thought of him?
==3== Does the rumor hold for true that he’s
==4== So full of gold?

**PAIN.**
==4==         Certain. Alcibiades reports it;
==5== Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him.
==6== He likewise enrich’d poor straggling soldiers with
==7== Great quantity. ’Tis said he gave unto
==8== His steward a mighty sum.

**POET.**
==8==               Then this breaking of his
==9== Has been but a try for his friends?

**PAIN.**
==9==                   Nothing else.
==10== You shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish
==11== With the highest. Therefore, ’tis not amiss
==12== We tender our loves to him in this suppos’d
==13== Distress of his; it will show honestly in us,
==14== And is very likely to load our purposes
==15== With what they travail for, if it be
==16== A just and true report that goes of his having.

**POET.**
==17== What have you now to present unto him?

**PAIN.**
==18== Nothing at this time but my visitation;
==19== Only I will promise him an excellent piece.

**POET.**
==20== I must serve him so too: tell him of an intent
==21== That’s coming toward him.

**PAIN.**
==21==               Good as the best.
==22== Promising is the very air o’ th’ time;
==23== It opens the eyes of expectation.
==24== Performance is ever the duller for his act,
==25== And but in the plainer and simpler kind of people
==26== The deed of saying is quite out of use.
==27== To promise is most courtly and fashionable;
==28== Performance is a kind of will or testament
==29== Which argues a great sickness in his judgment
==30== That makes it.

*Enter Timon from his cave.*

**TIM.**
*(Aside.)*
==31== Excellent workman! Thou canst not paint a man
==32== So bad as is thyself.

**POET.**
==32==            I am thinking
==33== What I shall say I have provided for him.
==34== It must be a personating of himself;
==35== A satire against the softness of prosperity,
==36== With a discovery of the infinite flatteries
==37== That follow youth and opulency.

**TIM.**
*(Aside.)*
==37==                   Must thou needs
==38== Stand for a villain in thine own work?
==39== Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men?
==40== Do so, I have gold for thee.

**POET.**
==40==               Nay, let’s seek him:
==41== Then do we sin against our own estate,
==42== When we may profit meet, and come too late.

**PAIN.**
==43== True:
==44== When the day serves, before black-corner’d night,
==45== Find what thou want’st by free and offer’d light.
==46== Come.

**TIM.**
*(Aside.)*
==47== I’ll meet you at the turn. What a god’s gold
==48== That he is worshipp’d in a baser temple
==49== Than where swine feed!
==50== ’Tis thou that rig’st the bark and plough’st the foam,
==51== Settlest admired reverence in a slave.
==52== To thee be worship, and thy saints for aye
==53== Be crown’d with plagues, that thee alone obey!
==54== Fit I meet them.

*Coming forward.*

**POET.**
==55== Hail, worthy Timon!

**PAIN.**
==55==            Our late noble master!

**TIM.**
==56== Have I once liv’d to see two honest men?

**POET.**
==57== Sir,
==58== Having often of your open bounty tasted,
==59== Hearing you were retir’d, your friends fall’n off,
==60== Whose thankless natures (O abhorred spirits!) 
==61== Not all the whips of heaven are large enough⁠—
==62== What, to you,
==63== Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
==64== To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover
==65== The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
==66== With any size of words.

**TIM.**
==67== Let it go naked, men may see’t the better.
==68== You that are honest, by being what you are
==69== Make them best seen and known.

**PAIN.**
==69==                   He and myself
==70== Have travail’d in the great show’r of your gifts,
==71== And sweetly felt it.

**TIM.**
==71==            Ay, you are honest men.

**PAIN.**
==72== We are hither come to offer you our service.

**TIM.**
==73== Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
==74== Can you eat roots and drink cold water? No?

**BOTH POET. AND PAIN.**
==75== What we can do, we’ll do, to do you service.

**TIM.**
==76== Y’ are honest men; y’ have heard that I have gold,
==77== I am sure you have. Speak truth, y’ are honest men.

**PAIN.**
==78== So it is said, my noble lord, but therefore
==79== Came not my friend nor I.

**TIM.**
==80== Good honest men! Thou draw’st a counterfeit
==81== Best in all Athens; th’ art indeed the best,
==82== Thou counterfeit’st most lively.

**PAIN.**
==82==                   So, so, my lord.

**TIM.**
==83== E’en so, sir, as I say.—And, for thy fiction,
==84== Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
==85== That thou art even natural in thine art.
==86== But for all this, my honest-natur’d friends,
==87== I must needs say you have a little fault;
==88== Marry, ’tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
==89== You take much pains to mend.

**BOTH POET. AND PAIN.**
==89==                 Beseech your honor
==90== To make it known to us.

**TIM.**
==90==               You’ll take it ill.

**BOTH POET. AND PAIN.**
==91== Most thankfully, my lord.

**TIM.**
==91==               Will you indeed?

**BOTH POET. AND PAIN.**
==92== Doubt it not, worthy lord.

**TIM.**
==93== There’s never a one of you but trusts a knave
==94== That mightily deceives you.

**BOTH POET. AND PAIN.**
==94==               Do we, my lord?

**TIM.**
==95== Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
==96== Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
==97== Keep in your bosom; yet remain assur’d
==98== That he’s a made-up villain.

**PAIN.**
==99== I know none such, my lord.

**POET.**
==99==               Nor I.

**TIM.**
==100== Look you, I love you well, I’ll give you gold,
==101== Rid me these villains from your companies;
==102== Hang them, or stab them, drown them in a draught,
==103== Confound them by some course, and come to me,
==104== I’ll give you gold enough.

**BOTH POET. AND PAIN.**
==105== Name them, my lord, let’s know them.

**TIM.**
==106== You that way and you this; but two in company;
==107== Each man apart, all single and alone,
==108== Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
*(To one.)*
==109== If where thou art, two villains shall not be,
==110== Come not near him.
*(To the other.)*
==111== If thou wouldst not reside
==112== But where one villain is, then him abandon.⁠—
==113== Hence, pack! There’s gold; you came for gold, ye slaves.
*(To one.)*
==114== You have work for me; there’s payment, hence!
*(To the other.)*
==115== You are an alcumist, make gold of that.
==116== Out, rascal dogs!

*Exeunt both, driven out by Timon, who retires to his cave.*

*Enter Steward Flavius and two Senators.*

**FLAV.**
==117== It is vain that you would speak with Timon;
==118== For he is set so only to himself,
==119== That nothing but himself which looks like man
==120== Is friendly with him.

**1. SEN.**
==120==            Bring us to his cave.
==121== It is our part and promise to th’ Athenians
==122== To speak with Timon.

**2. SEN.**
==122==               At all times alike
==123== Men are not still the same; ’twas time and griefs
==124== That fram’d him thus. Time with his fairer hand,
==125== Offering the fortunes of his former days,
==126== The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
==127== And chance it as it may.

**FLAV.**
==127==               Here is his cave.
==128== Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon,
==129== Look out and speak to friends. Th’ Athenians
==130== By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee.
==131== Speak to them, noble Timon.

*Enter Timon out of his cave.*

**TIM.**
==132== Thou sun that comforts, burn! Speak and be hang’d.
==133== For each true word, a blister, and each false
==134== Be as a cantherizing to the root o’ th’ tongue,
==135== Consuming it with speaking!

**1. SEN.**
==135==                 Worthy Timon⁠—

**TIM.**
==136== Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.

**1. SEN.**
==137== The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.

**TIM.**
==138== I thank them, and would send them back the plague,
==139== Could I but catch it for them.

**1. SEN.**
==139==                 O, forget
==140== What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
==141== The senators with one consent of love
==142== Entreat thee back to Athens, who have thought
==143== On special dignities, which vacant lie,
==144== For thy best use and wearing.

**2. SEN.**
==144==                 They confess
==145== Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross;
==146== Which now the public body, which doth seldom
==147== Play the recanter, feeling in itself
==148== A lack of Timon’s aid, hath sense withal
==149== Of it own fall, restraining aid to Timon,
==150== And send forth us to make their sorrowed render,
==151== Together with a recompense more fruitful
==152== Than their offense can weigh down by the dram;
==153== Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
==154== As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs,
==155== And write in thee the figures of their love,
==156== Ever to read them thine.

**TIM.**
==156==               You witch me in it;
==157== Surprise me to the very brink of tears.
==158== Lend me a fool’s heart and a woman’s eyes,
==159== And I’ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.

**1. SEN.**
==160== Therefore so please thee to return with us,
==161== And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
==162== The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
==163== Allow’d with absolute power, and thy good name
==164== Live with authority; so soon we shall drive back
==165== Of Alcibiades th’ approaches wild,
==166== Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
==167== His country’s peace.

**2. SEN.**
==167==            And shakes his threat’ning sword
==168== Against the walls of Athens.

**1. SEN.**
==168==               Therefore, Timon⁠—

**TIM.**
==169== Well, sir, I will; therefore I will, sir, thus:
==170== If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
==171== Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
==172== That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,
==173== And take our goodly aged men by th’ beards,
==174== Giving our holy virgins to the stain
==175== Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain’d war,
==176== Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
==177== In pity of our aged and our youth,
==178== I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,
==179== And let him take’t at worst—for their knives care not,
==180== While you have throats to answer. For myself,
==181== There’s not a whittle in th’ unruly camp
==182== But I do prize it at my love before
==183== The reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you
==184== To the protection of the prosperous gods,
==185== As thieves to keepers.

**FLAV.**
==185==            Stay not, all’s in vain.

**TIM.**
==186== Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
==187== It will be seen tomorrow. My long sickness
==188== Of health and living now begins to mend,
==189== And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
==190== Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
==191== And last so long enough!

**1. SEN.**
==191==               We speak in vain.

**TIM.**
==192== But yet I love my country, and am not
==193== One that rejoices in the common wrack,
==194== As common bruit doth put it.

**1. SEN.**
==194==                 That’s well spoke.

**TIM.**
==195== Commend me to my loving countrymen⁠—

**1. SEN.**
==196== These words become your lips as they pass thorough them.

**2. SEN.**
==197== And enter in our ears like great triumphers
==198== In their applauding gates.

**TIM.**
==198==               Commend me to them,
==199== And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
==200== Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
==201== Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
==202== That nature’s fragile vessel doth sustain
==203== In life’s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
==204== I’ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades’ wrath.

**1. SEN.**
==205== I like this well, he will return again.

**TIM.**
==206== I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
==207== That mine own use invites me to cut down,
==208== And shortly must I fell it. Tell my friends,
==209== Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree,
==210== From high to low throughout, that whoso please
==211== To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
==212== Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
==213== And hang himself. I pray you do my greeting.

**FLAV.**
==214== Trouble him no further, thus you still shall find him.

**TIM.**
==215== Come not to me again, but say to Athens,
==216== Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
==217== Upon the beached verge of the salt flood,
==218== Who once a day with his embossed froth
==219== The turbulent surge shall cover; thither come,
==220== And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
==221== Lips, let four words go by and language end!
==222== What is amiss, plague and infection mend!
==223== Graves only be men’s works, and death their gain!
==224== Sun, hide thy beams, Timon hath done his reign.

*Exit Timon.*

**1. SEN.**
==225== His discontents are unremovably
==226== Coupled to nature.

**2. SEN.**
==227== Our hope in him is dead. Let us return,
==228== And strain what other means is left unto us
==229== In our dear peril.

**1. SEN.**
==229==            It requires swift foot.

*Exeunt.*
