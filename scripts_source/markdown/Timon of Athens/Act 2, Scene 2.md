## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Athens. A hall in Timon’s house.*

*Enter Steward Flavius with many bills in his hand.*

**FLAV.**
==1== No care, no stop, so senseless of expense,
==2== That he will neither know how to maintain it,
==3== Nor cease his flow of riot. Takes no accompt
==4== How things go from him, nor resumes no care
==5== Of what is to continue. Never mind
==6== Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.
==7== What shall be done, he will not hear, till feel.
==8== I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.
==9== Fie, fie, fie, fie!

*Enter Caphis and the Servants of Isidore and Varro.*

**CAPH.**
==9==            Good even, Varro. What,
==10== You come for money?

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==10==               Is’t not your business too?

**CAPH.**
==11== It is; and yours too, Isidore?

**ISID. SERV.**
==11==                 It is so.

**CAPH.**
==12== Would we were all discharg’d!

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==12==                 I fear it.

**CAPH.**
==13== Here comes the lord.

*Enter Timon and his Train with Alcibiades.*

**TIM.**
==14== So soon as dinner’s done, we’ll forth again,
==15== My Alcibiades.—With me, what is your will?

**CAPH.**
==16== My lord, here is a note of certain dues.

**TIM.**
==17== Dues? Whence are you?

**CAPH.**
==17==               Of Athens here, my lord.

**TIM.**
==18== Go to my steward.

**CAPH.**
==19== Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
==20== To the succession of new days this month.
==21== My master is awak’d by great occasion
==22== To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
==23== That with your other noble parts you’ll suit
==24== In giving him his right.

**TIM.**
==24==               Mine honest friend,
==25== I prithee but repair to me next morning.

**CAPH.**
==26== Nay, good my lord⁠—

**TIM.**
==26==            Contain thyself, good friend.

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==27== One Varro’s servant, my good lord⁠—

**ISID. SERV.**
==27==                   From Isidore;
==28== He humbly prays your speedy payment.

**CAPH.**
==29== If you did know, my lord, my master’s wants⁠—

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==30== ’Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks
==31== And past.

**ISID. SERV.**
==31==     Your steward puts me off, my lord,
==32== And I am sent expressly to your lordship.

**TIM.**
==33== Give me breath.
==34== I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on,
==35== I’ll wait upon you instantly.
*(Exeunt Alcibiades and Lords.)*
*(To Flavius.)*
==35==                 Come hither. Pray you,
==36== How goes the world, that I am thus encount’red
==37== With clamorous demands of debt, broken bonds,
==38== And the detention of long since due debts,
==39== Against my honor?

**FLAV.**
==39==            Please you, gentlemen,
==40== The time is unagreeable to this business.
==41== Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
==42== That I may make his lordship understand
==43== Wherefore you are not paid.

**TIM.**
==44== Do so, my friends. See them well entertain’d.

*Exit.*

**FLAV.**
==45== Pray draw near.

*Exit.*

*Enter Apemantus and Fool.*

**CAPH.**
==46== Stay, stay, here comes the Fool with
==47== Apemantus, let’s ha’ some sport with ’em.

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==48== Hang him, he’ll abuse us.

**ISID. SERV.**
==49== A plague upon him, dog!

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==50== How dost, Fool?

**APEM.**
==51== Dost dialogue with thy shadow?

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==52== I speak not to thee.

**APEM.**
==53== No, ’tis to thyself.
*(To the Fool.)*
==54== Come away.

**ISID. SERV.**
*(To Varro’s Servant.)*
==55== There’s the Fool hangs on your back already.

**APEM.**
==56== No, thou stand’st single, th’ art not on him yet.

**CAPH.**
==57== Where’s the Fool now?

**APEM.**
==58== He last ask’d the question. Poor rogues, and usurers’ men, bawds between gold and want!

**ALL SERV.**
==59== What are we, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==60== Asses.

**ALL SERV.**
==61== Why?

**APEM.**
==62== That you ask me what you are, and do not know yourselves. Speak to ’em, Fool.

**FOOL.**
==63== How do you, gentlemen?

**ALL SERV.**
==64== Gramercies, good Fool; how does your mistress?

**FOOL.**
==65== She’s e’en setting on water to scald such chickens as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!

**APEM.**
==66== Good, gramercy.

*Enter Timon’s Page.*

**FOOL.**
==67== Look you, here comes my master’s page.

**TIM. PAGE.**
*(To the Fool.)*
==68== Why, how now, captain? What do you in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?

**APEM.**
==69== Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer thee profitably.

**TIM. PAGE.**
==70== Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of these letters, I know not which is which.

**APEM.**
==71== Canst not read?

**TIM. PAGE.**
==72== No.

**APEM.**
==73== There will little learning die then that day thou art hang’d. This is to Lord Timon, this to Alcibiades. Go, thou wast born a bastard, and thou’t die a bawd.

**TIM. PAGE.**
==74== Thou wast whelp’d a dog, and thou shalt famish a dog’s death. Answer not, I am gone.

*Exit.*

**APEM.**
==75== E’en so thou outrun’st grace. Fool, I will go with you to Lord Timon’s.

**FOOL.**
==76== Will you leave me there?

**APEM.**
==77== If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?

**ALL SERV.**
==78== Ay, would they serv’d us!

**APEM.**
==79== So would I—as good a trick as ever hangman serv’d thief.

**FOOL.**
==80== Are you three usurers’ men?

**ALL SERV.**
==81== Ay, Fool.

**FOOL.**
==82== I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant; my mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and go away merry; but they enter my master’s house merrily, and go away sadly. The reason of this?

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==83== I could render one.

**APEM.**
==84== Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave, which notwithstanding, thou shalt be no less esteem’d.

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==85== What is a whoremaster, Fool?

**FOOL.**
==86== A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. ’Tis a spirit; sometime’t appears like a lord, sometime like a lawyer, sometime like a philosopher, with two stones more than ’s artificial one. He is very often like a knight; and, generally, in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks in.

**1. VAR. SERV.**
==87== Thou art not altogether a fool.

**FOOL.**
==88== Nor thou altogether a wise man; as much foolery as I have, so much wit thou lack’st.

**APEM.**
==89== That answer might have become Apemantus.

**ALL SERV.**
==90== Aside, aside, here comes Lord Timon.

*Enter Timon and Steward Flavius.*

**APEM.**
==91== Come with me, Fool, come.

**FOOL.**
==92== I do not always follow lover, elder brother, and woman; sometime the philosopher.

*Exeunt Apemantus and Fool.*

**FLAV.**
==93== Pray you walk near, I’ll speak with you anon.

*Exeunt Servants.*

**TIM.**
==94== You make me marvel wherefore ere this time
==95== Had you not fully laid my state before me,
==96== That I might so have rated my expense
==97== As I had leave of means.

**FLAV.**
==97==               You would not hear me;
==98== At many leisures I propos’d.

**TIM.**
==98==                 Go to!
==99== Perchance some single vantages you took,
==100== When my indisposition put you back,
==101== And that unaptness made your minister
==102== Thus to excuse yourself.

**FLAV.**
==102==               O my good lord,
==103== At many times I brought in my accompts,
==104== Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
==105== And say you found them in mine honesty.
==106== When for some trifling present you have bid me
==107== Return so much, I have shook my head, and wept;
==108== Yea, ’gainst th’ authority of manners, pray’d you
==109== To hold your hand more close. I did endure
==110== Not seldom, nor no slight checks, when I have
==111== Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
==112== And your great flow of debts. My lov’d lord,
==113== Though you hear now (too late), yet now’s a time:
==114== The greatest of your having lacks a half
==115== To pay your present debts.

**TIM.**
==115==               Let all my land be sold.

**FLAV.**
==116== ’Tis all engag’d, some forfeited and gone,
==117== And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
==118== Of present dues. The future comes apace;
==119== What shall defend the interim? And at length
==120== How goes our reck’ning?

**TIM.**
==121== To Lacedaemon did my land extend.

**FLAV.**
==122== O my good lord, the world is but a word;
==123== Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
==124== How quickly were it gone!

**TIM.**
==124==               You tell me true.

**FLAV.**
==125== If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
==126== Call me before th’ exactest auditors,
==127== And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
==128== When all our offices have been oppress’d
==129== With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
==130== With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
==131== Hath blaz’d with lights and bray’d with minstrelsy,
==132== I have retir’d me to a wasteful cock,
==133== And set mine eyes at flow.

**TIM.**
==133==               Prithee no more.

**FLAV.**
==134== Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!
==135== How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
==136== This night englutted! Who is not Timon’s?
==137== What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is Lord Timon’s?
==138== Great Timon! Noble, worthy, royal Timon!
==139== Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
==140== The breath is gone whereof this praise is made.
==141== Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter show’rs,
==142== These flies are couch’d.

**TIM.**
==142==               Come, sermon me no further.
==143== No villainous bounty yet hath pass’d my heart;
==144== Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
==145== Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack
==146== To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
==147== If I would broach the vessels of my love,
==148== And try the argument of hearts, by borrowing,
==149== Men and men’s fortunes could I frankly use
==150== As I can bid thee speak.

**FLAV.**
==150==               Assurance bless your thoughts!

**TIM.**
==151== And in some sort these wants of mine are crown’d,
==152== That I account them blessings; for by these
==153== Shall I try friends. You shall perceive how you
==154== Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
==155== Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!

*Enter three servants: Flaminius, Servilius, and Timon’s Servant.*

**THREE SERVANTS.**
==156== My lord? My lord?

**TIM.**
==157== I will dispatch you severally: to Servilius you to Lord Lucius; to Flaminius to Lord Lucullus you—I hunted with his honor today; to the other you to Sempronius. Commend me to their loves; and I am proud, say, that my occasions have found time to use ’em toward a supply of money. Let the request be fifty talents.

**FLAM.**
==158== As you have said, my lord.

*Exeunt the three servants.*

**FLAV.**
*(Aside.)*
==159== Lord Lucius and Lucullus? Humh!

**TIM.**
==160== Go you, sir, to the senators⁠—
==161== Of whom, even to the state’s best health, I have
==162== Deserv’d this hearing—bid ’em send o’ th’ instant
==163== A thousand talents to me.

**FLAV.**
==163==               I have been bold
==164== (For that I knew it the most general way) 
==165== To them to use your signet and your name,
==166== But they do shake their heads, and I am here
==167== No richer in return.

**TIM.**
==167==            Is’t true? Can ’t be?

**FLAV.**
==168== They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
==169== That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
==170== Do what they would, are sorry; you are honorable,
==171== But yet they could have wish’d—they know not⁠—
==172== Something hath been amiss—a noble nature
==173== May catch a wrench—would all were well—’tis pity⁠—
==174== And so, intending other serious matters,
==175== After distasteful looks, and these hard fractions,
==176== With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods,
==177== They froze me into silence.

**TIM.**
==177==               You gods, reward them!
==178== Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
==179== Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
==180== Their blood is cak’d, ’tis cold, it seldom flows;
==181== ’Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
==182== And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
==183== Is fashion’d for the journey, dull and heavy.
==184== Go to Ventidius. (Prithee be not sad,
==185== Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak,
==186== No blame belongs to thee.) Ventidius lately
==187== Buried his father, by whose death he’s stepp’d
==188== Into a great estate. When he was poor,
==189== Imprison’d, and in scarcity of friends,
==190== I clear’d him with five talents. Greet him from me,
==191== Bid him suppose some good necessity
==192== Touches his friend, which craves to be rememb’red
==193== With those five talents. That had, give’t these fellows
==194== To whom ’tis instant due. Nev’r speak or think
==195== That Timon’s fortunes ’mong his friends can sink.

**FLAV.**
==196== I would I could not think it! That thought is bounty’s foe;
==197== Being free itself, it thinks all others so.

*Exeunt.*
