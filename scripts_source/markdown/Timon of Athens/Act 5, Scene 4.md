## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]]

*Before the walls of Athens.*

*Trumpets sound. Enter Alcibiades with his powers before Athens.*

**ALCIB.**
==1==Sound to this coward and lascivious town
==2==Our terrible approach.
*(Sounds a parley.)*
*(The Senators appear upon the walls.)*
==3==Till now you have gone on and fill’d the time
==4==With all licentious measure, making your wills
==5==The scope of justice; till now myself and such
==6==As slept within the shadow of your power
==7==Have wander’d with our travers’d arms, and breath’d
==8==Our sufferance vainly. Now the time is flush,
==9==When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
==10==Cries (of itself) “No more!”. Now breathless wrong
==11==Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
==12==And pursy insolence shall break his wind
==13==With fear and horrid flight.

**1. SEN.**
==13==              Noble and young⁠—
==14==When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
==15==Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
==16==We sent to thee to give thy rages balm,
==17==To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
==18==Above their quantity.

**2. SEN.**
==18==           So did we woo
==19==Transformed Timon to our city’s love
==20==By humble message and by promis’d means.
==21==We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
==22==The common stroke of war.

**1. SEN.**
==22==              These walls of ours
==23==Were not erected by their hands from whom
==24==You have receiv’d your grief; nor are they such
==25==That these great tow’rs, trophies, and schools should fall
==26==For private faults in them.

**2. SEN.**
==26==              Nor are they living
==27==Who were the motives that you first went out;
==28==Shame, that they wanted cunning in excess,
==29==Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
==30==Into our city with thy banners spread;
==31==By decimation, and a tithed death,
==32==If thy revenges hunger for that food
==33==Which nature loathes, take thou the destin’d tenth,
==34==And by the hazard of the spotted die
==35==Let die the spotted.

**1. SEN.**
==35==           All have not offended;
==36==For those that were, it is not square to take
==37==On those that are, revenge; crimes, like lands,
==38==Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
==39==Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage;
==40==Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
==41==Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
==42==With those that have offended; like a shepherd,
==43==Approach the fold and cull th’ infected forth,
==44==But kill not all together.

**2. SEN.**
==44==              What thou wilt,
==45==Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
==46==Than hew to’t with thy sword.

**1. SEN.**
==46==                Set but thy foot
==47==Against our rampir’d gates and they shall ope,
==48==So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
==49==To say thou’t enter friendly.

**2. SEN.**
==49==              Throw thy glove,
==50==Or any token of thine honor else,
==51==That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
==52==And not as our confusion, all thy powers
==53==Shall make their harbor in our town till we
==54==Have seal’d thy full desire.

**ALCIB.**
==54==              Then there’s my glove;
==55==Descend, and open your uncharged ports.
==56==Those enemies of Timon’s and mine own
==57==Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
==58==Fall, and no more; and to atone your fears
==59==With my more noble meaning, not a man
==60==Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
==61==Of regular justice in your city’s bounds,
==62==But shall be remedied to your public laws
==63==At heaviest answer.

**BOTH 1. SEN. AND 2. SEN.**
==63==           ’Tis most nobly spoken.

**ALCIB.**
==64==Descend, and keep your words.

*The Senators descend and open the gates.*

*Enter Soldier as a messenger.*

**SOLD.**
==65==My noble general, Timon is dead,
==66==Entomb’d upon the very hem o’ th’ sea,
==67==And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
==68==With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
==69==Interprets for my poor ignorance.

**ALCIB.**
*(Reads the epitaph.)*
==70==*“Here lies a wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft;*
==71==*Seek not my name: a plague consume you, wicked caitiffs left!*
==72==*Here lie I, Timon, who, alive, all living men did hate;*
==73==*Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay not here thy gait.”*
==74==These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
==75==Though thou abhorr’dst in us our human griefs,
==76==Scorn’dst our brains’ flow, and those our droplets which
==77==From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
==78==Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
==79==On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
==80==Is noble Timon, of whose memory
==81==Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
==82==And I will use the olive with my sword:
==83==Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
==84==Prescribe to other as each other’s leech.
==85==Let our drums strike.

*Exeunt.*
