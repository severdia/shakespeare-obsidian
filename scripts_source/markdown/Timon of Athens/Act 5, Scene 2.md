## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Before the walls of Athens.*

*Enter two other Senators with a Messenger.*

**3. SEN.**
==1== Thou hast painfully discover’d; are his files
==2== As full as thy report?

**MESS.**
==2==            I have spoke the least.
==3== Besides, his expedition promises
==4== Present approach.

**4. SEN.**
==5== We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.

**MESS.**
==6== I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,
==7== Whom, though in general part we were oppos’d,
==8== Yet our old love made a particular force,
==9== And made us speak like friends. This man was riding
==10== From Alcibiades to Timon’s cave
==11== With letters of entreaty, which imported
==12== His fellowship i’ th’ cause against your city,
==13== In part for his sake mov’d.

*Enter the other Senators.*

**3. SEN.**
==13==               Here come our brothers.

**1. SEN.**
==14== No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
==15== The enemy’s drum is heard, and fearful scouring
==16== Doth choke the air with dust. In, and prepare:
==17== Ours is the fall, I fear, our foes the snare.

*Exeunt.*
