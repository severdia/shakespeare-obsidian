## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Before the walls of Athens.*

*Enter two other Senators with a Messenger.*

**3. SEN.**
Thou hast painfully discover’d; are his files
As full as thy report?

**MESS.**
           I have spoke the least.
Besides, his expedition promises
Present approach.

**4. SEN.**
We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon.

**MESS.**
I met a courier, one mine ancient friend,
Whom, though in general part we were oppos’d,
Yet our old love made a particular force,
And made us speak like friends. This man was riding
From Alcibiades to Timon’s cave
With letters of entreaty, which imported
His fellowship i’ th’ cause against your city,
In part for his sake mov’d.

*Enter the other Senators.*

**3. SEN.**
              Here come our brothers.

**1. SEN.**
No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
The enemy’s drum is heard, and fearful scouring
Doth choke the air with dust. In, and prepare:
Ours is the fall, I fear, our foes the snare.

*Exeunt.*
