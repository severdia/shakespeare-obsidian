## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*A room in the Garter Inn.*

*Enter Falstaff, Host, Bardolph, Nym, Pistol, Robin, Falstaff’s page.*

**FAL.**
==1== Mine host of the Garter!

**HOST.**
==2== What says my bully-rook? Speak scholarly and wisely.

**FAL.**
==3== Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my followers.

**HOST.**
==4== Discard, bully Hercules, cashier; let them wag; trot, trot.

**FAL.**
==5== I sit at ten pounds a week.

**HOST.**
==6== Thou’rt an emperor—Caesar, Keiser, and Pheazar. I will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall tap. Said I well, bully Hector?

**FAL.**
==7== Do so, good mine host.

**HOST.**
==8== I have spoke; let him follow.
*(To Bardolph.)*
==9== Let me see thee froth and lime. I am at a word; follow.

*Exit.*

**FAL.**
==10== Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade. An old cloak makes a new jerkin; a wither’d servingman a fresh tapster. Go, *adieu*.

**BARD.**
==11== It is a life that I have desir’d. I will thrive.

**PIST.**
==12== O base Hungarian wight! Wilt thou the spigot wield?

*Exit Bardolph.*

**NYM.**
==13== He was gotten in drink. Is not the humor conceited?

**FAL.**
==14== I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox; his thefts were too open; his filching was like an unskillful singer, he kept not time.

**NYM.**
==15== The good humor is to steal at a minute’s rest.

**PIST.**
==16== “Convey,” the wise it call. “Steal”? Foh! A *fico* for the phrase!

**FAL.**
==17== Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

**PIST.**
==18== Why then let kibes ensue.

**FAL.**
==19== There is no remedy; I must cony-catch, I must shift.

**PIST.**
==20== Young ravens must have food.

**FAL.**
==21== Which of you know Ford of this town?

**PIST.**
==22== I ken the wight; he is of substance good.

**FAL.**
==23== My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.

**PIST.**
==24== Two yards, and more.

**FAL.**
==25== No quips now, Pistol! Indeed I am in the waist two yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about thrift. Briefly—I do mean to make love to Ford’s wife. I spy entertainment in her. She discourses, she carves, she gives the leer of invitation. I can construe the action of her familiar style, and the hardest voice of her behavior (to be English’d rightly) is, “I am Sir John Falstaff’s.”

**PIST.**
==26== He hath studied her well, and translated her will, out of honesty into English.

**NYM.**
==27== The anchor is deep. Will that humor pass?

**FAL.**
==28== Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her husband’s purse. He hath a legion of angels.

**PIST.**
==29== As many devils entertain; and “To her, boy,” say I.

**NYM.**
==30== The humor rises; it is good. Humor me the angels.

**FAL.**
==31== I have writ me here a letter to her; and here another to Page’s wife, who even now gave me good eyes too, examin’d my parts with most judicious iliads; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my foot, sometimes my portly belly.

**PIST.**
==32== Then did the sun on dunghill shine.

**NYM.**
==33== I thank thee for that humor.

**FAL.**
==34== O, she did so course o’er my exteriors with such a greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here’s another letter to her. She bears the purse too; she is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will be cheaters to them both, and they shall be exchequers to me. They shall be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go, bear thou this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to Mistress Ford. We will thrive, lads, we will thrive.

**PIST.**
==35== Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
==36== And by my side wear steel? Then Lucifer take all!

**NYM.**
==37== I will run no base humor. Here, take the humor-letter; I will keep the havior of reputation.

**FAL.**
*(To Robin.)*
==38== Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
==39== Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
==40== Rogues, hence, avaunt, vanish like hailstones; go!
==41== Trudge! Plod away i’ th’ hoof! Seek shelter, pack!
==42== Falstaff will learn the humor of the age,
==43== French thrift, you rogues—myself and skirted page.

*Exeunt Falstaff and Robin.*

**PIST.**
==44== Let vultures gripe thy guts! For gourd and fullam holds,
==45== And high and low beguiles the rich and poor.
==46== Tester I’ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
==47== Base Phrygian Turk!

**NYM.**
==48== I have operations in my head which be humors of revenge.

**PIST.**
==49== Wilt thou revenge?

**NYM.**
==50== By welkin and her star!

**PIST.**
==51== With wit or steel?

**NYM.**
==52== With both the humors, I.
==53== I will discuss the humor of this love to Page.

**PIST.**
==54== *And I to Ford shall eke unfold*
==55== *How Falstaff (varlet vile) *
==56== *His dove will prove, his gold will hold,*
==57== *And his soft couch defile.*

**NYM.**
==58== My humor shall not cool. I will incense Page to deal with poison; I will possess him with yallowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous—that is my true humor.

**PIST.**
==59== Thou art the Mars of malcontents. I second thee; troop on.

*Exeunt.*
