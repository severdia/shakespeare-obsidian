## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Another room in the Garter Inn.*

*Enter Fenton, Host.*

**HOST.**
==1==Master Fenton, talk not to me, my mind is heavy; I will give over all.

**FENT.**
==2==Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
==3==And (as I am a gentleman) I’ll give thee
==4==A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.

**HOST.**
==5==I will hear you, Master Fenton, and I will (at the least) keep your counsel.

**FENT.**
==6==From time to time I have acquainted you
==7==With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page,
==8==Who mutually hath answer’d my affection
==9==(So far forth as herself might be her chooser) 
==10==Even to my wish. I have a letter from her
==11==Of such contents as you will wonder at;
==12==The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
==13==That neither, singly, can be manifested
==14==Without the show of both. Fat Falstaff
==15==Hath a great scene; the image of the jest
==16==I’ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host:
==17==Tonight at Herne’s oak, just ’twixt twelve and one,
==18==Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
==19==The purpose why, is here; in which disguise,
==20==While other jests are something rank on foot,
==21==Her father hath commanded her to slip
==22==Away with Slender, and with him at Eton
==23==Immediately to marry. She hath consented.
==24==Now, sir,
==25==Her mother (even strong against that match
==26==And firm for Doctor Caius) hath appointed
==27==That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
==28==While other sports are tasking of their minds,
==29==And at the dean’ry, where a priest attends,
==30==Straight marry her. To this her mother’s plot
==31==She (seemingly obedient) likewise hath
==32==Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
==33==Her father means she shall be all in white;
==34==And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
==35==To take her by the hand and bid her go,
==36==She shall go with him. Her mother hath intended
==37==(The better to denote her to the doctor,
==38==For they must all be mask’d and vizarded) 
==39==That quaint in green she shall be loose enrob’d,
==40==With ribands pendant, flaring ’bout her head;
==41==And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
==42==To pinch her by the hand, and on that token,
==43==The maid hath given consent to go with him.

**HOST.**
==44==Which means she to deceive, father or mother?

**FENT.**
==45==Both, my good host, to go along with me.
==46==And here it rests, that you’ll procure the vicar
==47==To stay for me at church, ’twixt twelve and one,
==48==And in the lawful name of marrying,
==49==To give our hearts united ceremony.

**HOST.**
==50==Well, husband your device; I’ll to the vicar.
==51==Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.

**FENT.**
==52==So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
==53==Besides, I’ll make a present recompense.

*Exeunt.*
