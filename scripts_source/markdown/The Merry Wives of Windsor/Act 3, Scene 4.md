## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*A room in Page’s house.*

*Enter Fenton, Anne Page.*

**FENT.**
I see I cannot get thy father’s love,
Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

**ANNE.**
Alas, how then?

**FENT.**
        Why, thou must be thyself.
He doth object I am too great of birth,
And that my state being gall’d with my expense,
I seek to heal it only by his wealth.
Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
My riots past, my wild societies,
And tells me ’tis a thing impossible
I should love thee but as a property.

**ANNE.**
May be he tells you true.

**FENT.**
No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth
Was the first motive that I woo’d thee, Anne;
Yet wooing thee, I found thee of more value
Than stamps in gold, or sums in sealed bags;
And ’tis the very riches of thyself
That now I aim at.

**ANNE.**
           Gentle Master Fenton,
Yet seek my father’s love, still seek it, sir.
If opportunity and humblest suit
Cannot attain it, why then hark you hither!

*They converse apart.*

*Enter Shallow, Slender, Mistress Quickly.*

**SHAL.**
Break their talk, Mistress Quickly, my kinsman shall speak for himself.

**SLEN.**
I’ll make a shaft or a bolt on’t. ’Slid, ’tis but venturing.

**SHAL.**
Be not dismay’d.

**SLEN.**
No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for that, but that I am afeard.

**QUICK.**
Hark ye, Master Slender would speak a word with you.

**ANNE.**
I come to him.
*(Aside.)*
        This is my father’s choice.
O, what a world of vild ill-favor’d faults
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!

**QUICK.**
And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you a word with you.

**SHAL.**
She’s coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!

**SLEN.**
I had a father, Mistress Anne, my uncle can tell you good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole two geese out of a pen, good uncle.

**SHAL.**
Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.

**SLEN.**
Ay, that I do—as well as I love any woman in Gloucestershire.

**SHAL.**
He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.

**SLEN.**
Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the degree of a squire.

**SHAL.**
He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.

**ANNE.**
Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.

**SHAL.**
Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good comfort. She calls you, coz. I’ll leave you.

**ANNE.**
Now, Master Slender⁠—

**SLEN.**
Now, good Mistress Anne⁠—

**ANNE.**
What is your will?

**SLEN.**
My will? ’Od’s heartlings, that’s a pretty jest indeed! I ne’er made my will yet, I thank heaven. I am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.

**ANNE.**
I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?

**SLEN.**
Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath made motions. If it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They can tell you how things go better than I can. You may ask your father, here he comes.

*Enter Page, Mistress Page.*

**PAGE.**
Now, Master Slender. Love him, daughter Anne.
Why, how now? What does Master Fenton here?
You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house.
I told you, sir, my daughter is dispos’d of.

**FENT.**
Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

**MRS. PAGE.**
Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.

**PAGE.**
She is no match for you.

**FENT.**
Sir, will you hear me?

**PAGE.**
           No, good Master Fenton.
Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.

*Exeunt Page, Shallow, and Slender.*

**QUICK.**
Speak to Mistress Page.

**FENT.**
Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
In such a righteous fashion as I do,
Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,
I must advance the colors of my love,
And not retire. Let me have your good will.

**ANNE.**
Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

**MRS. PAGE.**
I mean it not, I seek you a better husband.

**QUICK.**
That’s my master, Master Doctor.

**ANNE.**
Alas, I had rather be set quick i’ th’ earth,
And bowl’d to death with turnips!

**MRS. PAGE.**
Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
I will not be your friend nor enemy.
My daughter will I question how she loves you,
And as I find her, so am I affected.
Till then farewell, sir; she must needs go in,
Her father will be angry.

**FENT.**
Farewell, gentle mistress; farewell, Nan.

*Exeunt Mrs. Page and Anne.*

**QUICK.**
This is my doing now. “Nay,” said I, “will you cast away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on Master Fenton.” This is my doing.

**FENT.**
I thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight
Give my sweet Nan this ring. There’s for thy pains.

**QUICK.**
Now heaven send thee good fortune!
*(Exit Fenton.)*
A kind heart he hath. A woman would run through fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her. I will do what I can for them all three, for so I have promis’d, and I’ll be as good as my word, but speciously for Master Fenton. Well, I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from my two mistresses. What a beast am I to slack it!

*Exit.*
