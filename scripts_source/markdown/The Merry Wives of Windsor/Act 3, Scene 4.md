## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*A room in Page’s house.*

*Enter Fenton, Anne Page.*

**FENT.**
==1==I see I cannot get thy father’s love,
==2==Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

**ANNE.**
==3==Alas, how then?

**FENT.**
==3==        Why, thou must be thyself.
==4==He doth object I am too great of birth,
==5==And that my state being gall’d with my expense,
==6==I seek to heal it only by his wealth.
==7==Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
==8==My riots past, my wild societies,
==9==And tells me ’tis a thing impossible
==10==I should love thee but as a property.

**ANNE.**
==11==May be he tells you true.

**FENT.**
==12==No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
==13==Albeit I will confess thy father’s wealth
==14==Was the first motive that I woo’d thee, Anne;
==15==Yet wooing thee, I found thee of more value
==16==Than stamps in gold, or sums in sealed bags;
==17==And ’tis the very riches of thyself
==18==That now I aim at.

**ANNE.**
==18==           Gentle Master Fenton,
==19==Yet seek my father’s love, still seek it, sir.
==20==If opportunity and humblest suit
==21==Cannot attain it, why then hark you hither!

*They converse apart.*

*Enter Shallow, Slender, Mistress Quickly.*

**SHAL.**
==22==Break their talk, Mistress Quickly, my kinsman shall speak for himself.

**SLEN.**
==23==I’ll make a shaft or a bolt on’t. ’Slid, ’tis but venturing.

**SHAL.**
==24==Be not dismay’d.

**SLEN.**
==25==No, she shall not dismay me. I care not for that, but that I am afeard.

**QUICK.**
==26==Hark ye, Master Slender would speak a word with you.

**ANNE.**
==27==I come to him.
*(Aside.)*
==27==        This is my father’s choice.
==28==O, what a world of vild ill-favor’d faults
==29==Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a year!

**QUICK.**
==30==And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you a word with you.

**SHAL.**
==31==She’s coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!

**SLEN.**
==32==I had a father, Mistress Anne, my uncle can tell you good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress Anne the jest how my father stole two geese out of a pen, good uncle.

**SHAL.**
==33==Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.

**SLEN.**
==34==Ay, that I do—as well as I love any woman in Gloucestershire.

**SHAL.**
==35==He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.

**SLEN.**
==36==Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the degree of a squire.

**SHAL.**
==37==He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.

**ANNE.**
==38==Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.

**SHAL.**
==39==Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good comfort. She calls you, coz. I’ll leave you.

**ANNE.**
==40==Now, Master Slender⁠—

**SLEN.**
==41==Now, good Mistress Anne⁠—

**ANNE.**
==42==What is your will?

**SLEN.**
==43==My will? ’Od’s heartlings, that’s a pretty jest indeed! I ne’er made my will yet, I thank heaven. I am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.

**ANNE.**
==44==I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?

**SLEN.**
==45==Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing with you. Your father and my uncle hath made motions. If it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be his dole! They can tell you how things go better than I can. You may ask your father, here he comes.

*Enter Page, Mistress Page.*

**PAGE.**
==46==Now, Master Slender. Love him, daughter Anne.
==47==Why, how now? What does Master Fenton here?
==48==You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house.
==49==I told you, sir, my daughter is dispos’d of.

**FENT.**
==50==Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==51==Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.

**PAGE.**
==52==She is no match for you.

**FENT.**
==53==Sir, will you hear me?

**PAGE.**
==53==           No, good Master Fenton.
==54==Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
==55==Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.

*Exeunt Page, Shallow, and Slender.*

**QUICK.**
==56==Speak to Mistress Page.

**FENT.**
==57==Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
==58==In such a righteous fashion as I do,
==59==Perforce, against all checks, rebukes, and manners,
==60==I must advance the colors of my love,
==61==And not retire. Let me have your good will.

**ANNE.**
==62==Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==63==I mean it not, I seek you a better husband.

**QUICK.**
==64==That’s my master, Master Doctor.

**ANNE.**
==65==Alas, I had rather be set quick i’ th’ earth,
==66==And bowl’d to death with turnips!

**MRS. PAGE.**
==67==Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
==68==I will not be your friend nor enemy.
==69==My daughter will I question how she loves you,
==70==And as I find her, so am I affected.
==71==Till then farewell, sir; she must needs go in,
==72==Her father will be angry.

**FENT.**
==73==Farewell, gentle mistress; farewell, Nan.

*Exeunt Mrs. Page and Anne.*

**QUICK.**
==74==This is my doing now. “Nay,” said I, “will you cast away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on Master Fenton.” This is my doing.

**FENT.**
==75==I thank thee; and I pray thee, once tonight
==76==Give my sweet Nan this ring. There’s for thy pains.

**QUICK.**
==77==Now heaven send thee good fortune!
*(Exit Fenton.)*
==78==A kind heart he hath. A woman would run through fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master Fenton had her. I will do what I can for them all three, for so I have promis’d, and I’ll be as good as my word, but speciously for Master Fenton. Well, I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from my two mistresses. What a beast am I to slack it!

*Exit.*
