## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Windsor. A street.*

*Enter Mistress Page, Mistress Quickly, William.*

**MRS. PAGE.**
==1==Is he at Master Ford’s already, think’st thou?

**QUICK.**
==2==Sure he is by this—or will be presently. But truly he is very courageous mad about his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==3==I’ll be with her by and by; I’ll but bring my young man here to school.
*(Enter Evans.)*
==4==Look where his master comes; ’tis a playing-day, I see. How now, Sir Hugh, no school today?

**EVANS.**
==5==No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.

**QUICK.**
==6==Blessing of his heart!

**MRS. PAGE.**
==7==Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at his book. I pray you ask him some questions in his accidence.

**EVANS.**
==8==Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==9==Come on, sirrah; hold up your head. Answer your master, be not afraid.

**EVANS.**
==10==William, how many numbers is in nouns?

**WILL.**
==11==Two.

**QUICK.**
==12==Truly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say, “’Od’s nouns.”

**EVANS.**
==13==Peace your tattlings! What is “fair,” William?

**WILL.**
==14==*Pulcher.*

**QUICK.**
==15==Poulcats? There are fairer things than poulcats sure.

**EVANS.**
==16==You are a very simplicity oman; I pray you peace. What is *lapis*, William?

**WILL.**
==17==A stone.

**EVANS.**
==18==And what is ‘a stone,’ William?

**WILL.**
==19==A pebble.

**EVANS.**
==20==No; it is *lapis*. I pray you remember in your prain.

**WILL.**
==21==*Lapis.*

**EVANS.**
==22==That is a good William. What is he, William, that does lend articles?

**WILL.**
==23==Articles are borrow’d of the pronoun, and be thus declin’d, *Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.*

**EVANS.**
==24==*Nominativo*, *hig, hag, hog*; pray you mark; *genitivo, hujus*. Well, what is your accusative case?

**WILL.**
==25==*Accusativo, hinc.*

**EVANS.**
==26==I pray you have your remembrance, child. *Accusativo, hung, hang, hog.*

**QUICK.**
==27==*“Hang-hog”* is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.

**EVANS.**
==28==Leave your *prabbles*, oman. What is the *focative* case, William?

**WILL.**
==29==O—vocativo, O.

**EVANS.**
==30==Remember, William, focative is *caret*.

**QUICK.**
==31==And that’s a good root.

**EVANS.**
==32==Oman, forbear.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==33==Peace!

**EVANS.**
==34==What is your genitive case plural, William?

**WILL.**
==35==Genitive case?

**EVANS.**
==36==Ay.

**WILL.**
==37==*Genitivo, horum, harum, horum.*

**QUICK.**
==38==Vengeance of Jinny’s case! Fie on her! Never name her, child, if she be a whore.

**EVANS.**
==39==For shame, oman.

**QUICK.**
==40==You do ill to teach the child such words. He teaches him to “hic” and to “hac,” which they’ll do fast enough of themselves, and to call “horum,”—fie upon you!

**EVANS.**
==41==Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as I would desires.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==42==Prithee hold thy peace.

**EVANS.**
==43==Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.

**WILL.**
==44==Forsooth, I have forgot.

**EVANS.**
==45==It is *qui, quae, quod*: if you forget your qui’s, your *quae’s*, and your *quod’s*, you must be *preeches*. Go your ways and play, go.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==46==He is a better scholar than I thought he was.

**EVANS.**
==47==He is a good *sprag* memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==48==*Adieu*, good Sir Hugh.
*(Exit Evans.)*
==49==Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.

*Exeunt.*
