## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Windsor. A street.*

*Enter Mistress Page, Mistress Quickly, William.*

**MRS. PAGE.**
Is he at Master Ford’s already, think’st thou?

**QUICK.**
Sure he is by this—or will be presently. But truly he is very courageous mad about his throwing into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.

**MRS. PAGE.**
I’ll be with her by and by; I’ll but bring my young man here to school.
*(Enter Evans.)*
Look where his master comes; ’tis a playing-day, I see. How now, Sir Hugh, no school today?

**EVANS.**
No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.

**QUICK.**
Blessing of his heart!

**MRS. PAGE.**
Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in the world at his book. I pray you ask him some questions in his accidence.

**EVANS.**
Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.

**MRS. PAGE.**
Come on, sirrah; hold up your head. Answer your master, be not afraid.

**EVANS.**
William, how many numbers is in nouns?

**WILL.**
Two.

**QUICK.**
Truly, I thought there had been one number more, because they say, “’Od’s nouns.”

**EVANS.**
Peace your tattlings! What is “fair,” William?

**WILL.**
*Pulcher.*

**QUICK.**
Poulcats? There are fairer things than poulcats sure.

**EVANS.**
You are a very simplicity oman; I pray you peace. What is *lapis*, William?

**WILL.**
A stone.

**EVANS.**
And what is ‘a stone,’ William?

**WILL.**
A pebble.

**EVANS.**
No; it is *lapis*. I pray you remember in your prain.

**WILL.**
*Lapis.*

**EVANS.**
That is a good William. What is he, William, that does lend articles?

**WILL.**
Articles are borrow’d of the pronoun, and be thus declin’d, *Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.*

**EVANS.**
*Nominativo*, *hig, hag, hog*; pray you mark; *genitivo, hujus*. Well, what is your accusative case?

**WILL.**
*Accusativo, hinc.*

**EVANS.**
I pray you have your remembrance, child. *Accusativo, hung, hang, hog.*

**QUICK.**
*“Hang-hog”* is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.

**EVANS.**
Leave your *prabbles*, oman. What is the *focative* case, William?

**WILL.**
O—vocativo, O.

**EVANS.**
Remember, William, focative is *caret*.

**QUICK.**
And that’s a good root.

**EVANS.**
Oman, forbear.

**MRS. PAGE.**
Peace!

**EVANS.**
What is your genitive case plural, William?

**WILL.**
Genitive case?

**EVANS.**
Ay.

**WILL.**
*Genitivo, horum, harum, horum.*

**QUICK.**
Vengeance of Jinny’s case! Fie on her! Never name her, child, if she be a whore.

**EVANS.**
For shame, oman.

**QUICK.**
You do ill to teach the child such words. He teaches him to “hic” and to “hac,” which they’ll do fast enough of themselves, and to call “horum,”—fie upon you!

**EVANS.**
Oman, art thou lunatics? Hast thou no understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as I would desires.

**MRS. PAGE.**
Prithee hold thy peace.

**EVANS.**
Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.

**WILL.**
Forsooth, I have forgot.

**EVANS.**
It is *qui, quae, quod*: if you forget your qui’s, your *quae’s*, and your *quod’s*, you must be *preeches*. Go your ways and play, go.

**MRS. PAGE.**
He is a better scholar than I thought he was.

**EVANS.**
He is a good *sprag* memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.

**MRS. PAGE.**
*Adieu*, good Sir Hugh.
*(Exit Evans.)*
Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.

*Exeunt.*
