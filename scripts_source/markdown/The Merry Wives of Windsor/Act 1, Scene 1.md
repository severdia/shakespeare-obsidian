[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Windsor. A street in front of Page’s house.*

*Enter Justice Shallow, Slender, Sir Hugh Evans.*

**SHAL.**
==1==Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star Chamber matter of it. If he were twenty Sir John Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.

**SLEN.**
==2==In the county of Gloucester, Justice of Peace and Coram.

**SHAL.**
==3==Ay, cousin Slender, and Custa-lorum.

**SLEN.**
==4==Ay, and Rato-lorum too; and a gentleman born, Master Parson, who writes himself Armigero, in any bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, Armigero.

**SHAL.**
==5==Ay, that I do, and have done any time these three hundred years.

**SLEN.**
==6==All his successors (gone before him) hath done’t; and all his ancestors (that come after him) may. They may give the dozen white luces in their coat.

**SHAL.**
==7==It is an old coat.

**EVANS.**
==8==The dozen white *louses* do become an old coat well; it agrees well, passant. It is a familiar beast to man, and signifies love.

**SHAL.**
==9==The luce is the fresh fish, the salt fish is an old coat.

**SLEN.**
==10==I may quarter, coz.

**SHAL.**
==11==You may, by marrying.

**EVANS.**
==12==It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.

**SHAL.**
==13==Not a whit.

**EVANS.**
==14==Yes, *py’r* lady. If he has a quarter of your coat, there is but three skirts for yourself, in my simple conjectures. But that is all one. If Sir John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my benevolence to make atonements and compromises between you.

**SHAL.**
==15==The Council shall hear it, it is a riot.

**EVANS.**
==16==It is not meet the Council hear a riot; there is no fear of Got in a riot. The Council, look you, shall desire to hear the fear of *Got*, and not to hear a riot. Take your vizaments in that.

**SHAL.**
==17==Ha! O’ my life, if I were young again, the sword should end it.

**EVANS.**
==18==It is *petter* that friends is the *sword*, and end it; and there is also another device in my *prain*, which peradventure *prings* *goot* discretions with it: there is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master George Page, which is pretty virginity.

**SLEN.**
==19==Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks small like a woman.

**EVANS.**
==20==It is that *fery* person for all the *orld*, as just as you will desire, and seven hundred pounds of moneys, and gold, and silver, is her grandsire upon his death’s-bed (*Got* deliver to a joyful resurrections!) give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years old. It were a *goot* motion if we leave our pribbles and *prabbles*, and desire a marriage between Master Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.

**SLEN.**
==21==Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?

**EVANS.**
==22==Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.

**SLEN.**
==23==I know the young gentlewoman, she has good gifts.

**EVANS.**
==24==Seven hundred pounds, and possibilities, is *goot* gifts.

**SHAL.**
==25==Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?

**EVANS.**
==26==Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do despise one that is false, or as I despise one that is not true. The knight Sir John is there, and I beseech you be rul’d by your well-willers. I will *peat* the door for Master Page.
*(Knocks.)*
==27==What ho! Got *pless* your house here!

**PAGE.**
*(Within.)*
==28==Who’s there?

*Enter Page.*

**EVANS.**
==29==Here is Got’s plessing, and your friend, and Justice Shallow, and here young Master Slender, that peradventures shall tell you another tale, if matters grow to your likings.

**PAGE.**
==30==I am glad to see your worships well. I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.

**SHAL.**
==31==Master Page, I am glad to see you. Much good do it your good heart! I wish’d your venison better, it was ill kill’d. How doth good Mistress Page?—and I thank you always with my heart, la! With my heart.

**PAGE.**
==32==Sir, I thank you.

**SHAL.**
==33==Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.

**PAGE.**
==34==I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.

**SLEN.**
==35==How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he was outrun on Cotsall.

**PAGE.**
==36==It could not be judg’d, sir.

**SLEN.**
==37==You’ll not confess, you’ll not confess.

**SHAL.**
==38==That he will not. ’Tis your fault, ’tis your fault; ’tis a good dog.

**PAGE.**
==39==A cur, sir.

**SHAL.**
==40==Sir! He’s a good dog, and a fair dog—can there be more said? He is good, and fair. Is Sir John Falstaff here?

**PAGE.**
==41==Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good office between you.

**EVANS.**
==42==It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.

**SHAL.**
==43==He hath wrong’d me, Master Page.

**PAGE.**
==44==Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.

**SHAL.**
==45==If it be confess’d, it is not redress’d. Is not that so, Master Page? He hath wrong’d me, indeed he hath, at a word he hath. Believe me, Robert Shallow, esquire, saith he is wrong’d.

**PAGE.**
==46==Here comes Sir John.

*Enter Sir John Falstaff, Bardolph, Nym, Pistol.*

**FAL.**
==47==Now, Master Shallow, you’ll complain of me to the King?

**SHAL.**
==48==Knight, you have beaten my men, kill’d my deer, and broke open my lodge.

**FAL.**
==49==But not kiss’d your keeper’s daughter?

**SHAL.**
==50==Tut, a pin! This shall be answer’d.

**FAL.**
==51==I will answer it straight: I have done all this. That is now answer’d.

**SHAL.**
==52==The Council shall know this.

**FAL.**
==53==’Twere better for you if it were known in counsel. You’ll be laugh’d at.

**EVANS.**
==54==*Pauca verba*; Sir John, good worts.

**FAL.**
==55==Good worts? Good cabbage. Slender, I broke your head; what matter have you against me?

**SLEN.**
==56==Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you, and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph, Nym, and Pistol. They carried me to the tavern and made me drunk, and afterward pick’d my pocket.

**BARD.**
==57==You Banbury cheese!

**SLEN.**
==58==Ay, it is no matter.

**PIST.**
==59==How now, Mephostophilus?

**SLEN.**
==60==Ay, it is no matter.

**NYM.**
==61==Slice, I say! *Pauca, pauca.* Slice, that’s my humor.

**SLEN.**
==62==Where’s Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?

**EVANS.**
==63==Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is three umpires in this matter, as I understand: that is, Master Page (*fidelicet* Master Page) and there is myself (*fidelicet* myself) and the three party is (lastly and finally) mine host of the Garter.

**PAGE.**
==64==We three to hear it and end it between them.

**EVANS.**
==65==Fery goot. I will make a *prief* of it in my note-book, and we will afterwards *ork* upon the cause with as great discreetly as we can.

**FAL.**
==66==Pistol!

**PIST.**
==67==He hears with ears.

**EVANS.**
==68==The *tevil* and his *tam*! What phrase is this? “He hears with ear”? Why, it is affectations.

**FAL.**
==69==Pistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?

**SLEN.**
==70==Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might never come in mine own great chamber again else, of seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two pence a-piece of Yead Miller—by these gloves.

**FAL.**
==71==Is this true, Pistol?

**EVANS.**
==72==No, it is false, if it is a pick-purse.

**PIST.**
==73==Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John, and master mine,
==74==I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
==75==Word of denial in thy *labras* here!
==76==Word of denial! Froth and scum, thou liest!

**SLEN.**
==77==By these gloves, then ’twas he.

**NYM.**
==78==Be avis’d, sir, and pass good humors. I will say “marry trap” with you, if you run the nuthook’s humor on me—that is the very note of it.

**SLEN.**
==79==By this hat, then he in the red face had it; for though I cannot remember what I did when you made me drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.

**FAL.**
==80==What say you, Scarlet and John?

**BARD.**
==81==Why, sir, for my part, I say the gentleman had drunk himself out of his five sentences.

**EVANS.**
==82==It is his five senses. Fie, what the ignorance is!

**BARD.**
==83==And being fap, sir, was (as they say) cashier’d; and so conclusions pass’d the careers.

**SLEN.**
==84==Ay, you spake in Latin then too: but ’tis no matter; I’ll ne’er be drunk whilst I live again, but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick. If I be drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.

**EVANS.**
==85==So *Got* *udge* me, that is a virtuous mind.

**FAL.**
==86==You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.

*Enter Anne Page with wine, Mistress Ford, Mistress Page.*

**PAGE.**
==87==Nay, daughter, carry the wine in, we’ll drink within.

*Exit Anne Page.*

**SLEN.**
==88==O heaven! This is Mistress Anne Page.

**PAGE.**
==89==How now, Mistress Ford?

**FAL.**
==90==Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met. By your leave, good mistress.

*Kisses her.*

**PAGE.**
==91==Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a hot venison pasty to dinner. Come, gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.

*Exeunt all except Shallow, Slender, and Evans.*

**SLEN.**
==92==I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets here.
*(Enter Simple.)*
==93==How now, Simple, where have you been? I must wait on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles about you, have you?

**SIM.**
==94==Book of Riddles? Why, did you not lend it to Alice Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight afore Michaelmas?

**SHAL.**
==95==Come, coz, come, coz, we stay for you. A word with you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is as ’twere a tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh here. Do you understand me?

**SLEN.**
==96==Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable. If it be so, I shall do that that is reason.

**SHAL.**
==97==Nay, but understand me.

**SLEN.**
==98==So I do, sir.

**EVANS.**
==99==Give ear to his motions: Master Slender, I will description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.

**SLEN.**
==100==Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says. I pray you pardon me; he’s a Justice of Peace in his country, simple though I stand here.

**EVANS.**
==101==But that is not the question: the question is concerning your marriage.

**SHAL.**
==102==Ay, there’s the point, sir.

**EVANS.**
==103==Marry, is it; the very point of it—to Mistress Anne Page.

**SLEN.**
==104==Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any reasonable demands.

**EVANS.**
==105==But can you affection the *oman*? Let us command to know that of your mouth, or of your lips; for diverse philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the mouth. Therefore precisely, can you carry your good will to the maid?

**SHAL.**
==106==Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?

**SLEN.**
==107==I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that would do reason.

**EVANS.**
==108==Nay, Got’s lords and his ladies, you must speak *possitable*, if you can carry her your desires towards her.

**SHAL.**
==109==That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?

**SLEN.**
==110==I will do a greater thing than that, upon your request, cousin, in any reason.

**SHAL.**
==111==Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz; what I do is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?

**SLEN.**
==112==I will marry her, sir, at your request; but if there be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are married and have more occasion to know one another. I hope, upon familiarity will grow more content. But if you say, “Marry her,” I will marry her; that I am freely dissolv’d, and dissolutely.

**EVANS.**
==113==It is a fery discretion answer, save the fall is in the *ord* “dissolutely.” The *ort* is (according to our meaning) “resolutely.” His meaning is good.

**SHAL.**
==114==Ay—I think my cousin meant well.

**SLEN.**
==115==Ay, or else I would I might be hang’d, la!

**SHAL.**
==116==Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
*(Enter Anne Page.)*
==117==Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!

**ANNE.**
==118==The dinner is on the table. My father desires your worships’ company.

**SHAL.**
==119==I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.

**EVANS.**
==120==’Od’s plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.

*Exeunt Shallow and Evans.*

**ANNE.**
==121==Will’t please your worship to come in, sir?

**SLEN.**
==122==No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.

**ANNE.**
==123==The dinner attends you, sir.

**SLEN.**
==124==I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go, sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my cousin Shallow.
*(Exit Simple.)*
==125==A Justice of Peace sometime may be beholding to his friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy yet, till my mother be dead. But what though? Yet I live like a poor gentleman born.

**ANNE.**
==126==I may not go in without your worship; they will not sit till you come.

**SLEN.**
==127==I’faith, I’ll eat nothing. I thank you as much as though I did.

**ANNE.**
==128==I pray you, sir, walk in.

**SLEN.**
==129==I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruis’d my shin th’ other day with playing at sword and dagger with a master of fence (three veneys for a dish of stew’d prunes) and by my troth, I cannot abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your dogs bark so? Be there bears i’ th’ town?

**ANNE.**
==130==I think there are, sir, I heard them talk’d of.

**SLEN.**
==131==I love the sport well, but I shall as soon quarrel at it as any man in England. You are afraid if you see the bear loose, are you not?

**ANNE.**
==132==Ay indeed, sir.

**SLEN.**
==133==That’s meat and drink to me, now. I have seen Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by the chain; but (I warrant you) the women have so cried and shriek’d at it, that it pass’d. But women, indeed, cannot abide ’em, they are very ill-favor’d rough things.

*Enter Page.*

**PAGE.**
==134==Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.

**SLEN.**
==135==I’ll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.

**PAGE.**
==136==By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! Come, come.

**SLEN.**
==137==Nay, pray you lead the way.

**PAGE.**
==138==Come on, sir.

**SLEN.**
==139==Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.

**ANNE.**
==140==Not I, sir, pray you keep on.

**SLEN.**
==141==Truly I will not go first; truly la! I will not do you that wrong.

**ANNE.**
==142==I pray you, sir.

**SLEN.**
==143==I’ll rather be unmannerly than troublesome. You do yourself wrong indeed la!

*Exeunt.*
