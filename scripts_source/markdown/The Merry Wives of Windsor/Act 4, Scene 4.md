## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*A room in Ford’s house.*

*Enter Page, Ford, Mistress Page, Mistress Ford, and Evans.*

**EVANS.**
==1== ’Tis one of the best discretions of a oman as ever I did look upon.

**PAGE.**
==2== And did he send you both these letters at an instant?

**MRS. PAGE.**
==3== Within a quarter of an hour.

**FORD.**
==4== Pardon me, wife, henceforth do what thou wilt.
==5== I rather will suspect the sun with cold
==6== Than thee with wantonness. Now doth thy honor stand,
==7== In him that was of late an heretic,
==8== As firm as faith.

**PAGE.**
==8==         ’Tis well, ’tis well, no more.
==9== Be not as extreme in submission as in offense;
==10== But let our plot go forward. Let our wives
==11== Yet once again (to make us public sport) 
==12== Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
==13== Where we may take him, and disgrace him for it.

**FORD.**
==14== There is no better way than that they spoke of.

**PAGE.**
==15== How? To send him word they’ll meet him in the park at midnight? Fie, fie, he’ll never come.

**EVANS.**
==16== You say he has been thrown in the rivers, and has been grievously peaten as an old oman. Methinks there should be terrors in him that he should not come; methinks his flesh is punish’d, he shall have no desires.

**PAGE.**
==17== So think I too.

**MRS. FORD.**
==18== Devise but how you’ll use him when he comes,
==19== And let us two devise to bring him thither.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==20== There is an old tale goes, that Herne the Hunter
==21== (Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest) 
==22== Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
==23== Walk round about an oak, with great ragg’d horns,
==24== And there he blasts the tree, and takes the cattle,
==25== And makes milch-kine yield blood, and shakes a chain
==26== In a most hideous and dreadful manner.
==27== You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
==28== The superstitious idle-headed eld
==29== Receiv’d and did deliver to our age
==30== This tale of Herne the Hunter for a truth.

**PAGE.**
==31== Why, yet there want not many that do fear
==32== In deep of night to walk by this Herne’s oak.
==33== But what of this?

**MRS. FORD.**
==33==            Marry, this is our device:
==34== That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us,
==35== Disguis’d like Herne, with huge horns on his head.

**PAGE.**
==36== Well, let it not be doubted but he’ll come,
==37== And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
==38== What shall be done with him? What is your plot?

**MRS. PAGE.**
==39== That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
==40== Nan Page (my daughter) and my little son,
==41== And three or four more of their growth, we’ll dress
==42== Like urchins, ouphes, and fairies, green and white,
==43== With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
==44== And rattles in their hands. Upon a sudden,
==45== As Falstaff, she, and I are newly met,
==46== Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
==47== With some diffused song. Upon their sight,
==48== We two in great amazedness will fly;
==49== Then let them all encircle him about,
==50== And fairy-like to pinch the unclean knight;
==51== And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
==52== In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
==53== In shape profane.

**MRS. FORD.**
==53==         And till he tell the truth,
==54== Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound,
==55== And burn him with their tapers.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==55==                 The truth being known,
==56== We’ll all present ourselves; dis-horn the spirit,
==57== And mock him home to Windsor.

**FORD.**
==57==                   The children must
==58== Be practic’d well to this, or they’ll nev’r do’t.

**EVANS.**
==59== I will teach the children their behaviors; and I will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the knight with my *taber*.

**FORD.**
==60== That will be excellent. I’ll go buy them vizards.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==61== My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
==62== Finely attired in a robe of white.

**PAGE.**
==63== That silk will I go buy.
*(Aside.)*
==64== And in that time
==65== Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away,
==66== And marry her at Eton.—Go, send to Falstaff straight.

**FORD.**
==67== Nay, I’ll to him again in name of Brook;
==68== He’ll tell me all his purpose. Sure he’ll come.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==69== Fear not you that. Go get us properties
==70== And tricking for our fairies.

**EVANS.**
==71== Let us about it. It is admirable pleasures and fery honest knaveries.

*Exeunt Page, Ford, and Evans.*

**MRS. PAGE.**
==72== Go, Mistress Ford,
==73== Send Quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
*(Exit Mrs. Ford.)*
==74== I’ll to the doctor, he hath my good will,
==75== And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
==76== That Slender (though well landed) is an idiot;
==77== And he my husband best of all affects.
==78== The doctor is well money’d, and his friends
==79== Potent at court. He, none but he, shall have her,
==80== Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.

*Exit.*
