**SHAL.**
He is the wiser man, Master Doctor: he is a curer of souls, and you a curer of bodies. If you should fight, you go against the hair of your professions. Is it not true, Master Page?

**PAGE.**
Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great fighter, though now a man of peace.

**SHAL.**
Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old and of the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to make one. Though we are justices and doctors and churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our youth in us, we are the sons of women, Master Page.

**PAGE.**
’Tis true, Master Shallow.

**SHAL.**
It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am sworn of the peace. You have show’d yourself a wise physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise and patient churchman. You must go with me, Master Doctor.

**HOST.**
And I will provoke him to’t, or let him wag.

*Aside to them.*

**PAGE.**

**SHAL.**
We will do it.
