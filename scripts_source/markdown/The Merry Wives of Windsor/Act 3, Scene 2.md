## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Windsor. A street.*

*Enter Mistress Page, Robin.*

**MRS. PAGE.**
==1== Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master’s heels?

**ROB.**
==2== I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man than follow him like a dwarf.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==3== O, you are a flattering boy, now I see you’ll be a courtier.

*Enter Ford.*

**FORD.**
==4== Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?

**MRS. PAGE.**
==5== Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?

**FORD.**
==6== Ay, and as idle as she may hang together, for want of company. I think if your husbands were dead, you two would marry.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==7== Be sure of that—two other husbands.

**FORD.**
==8== Where had you this pretty weathercock?

**MRS. PAGE.**
==9== I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my husband had him of. What do you call your knight’s name, sirrah?

**ROB.**
==10== Sir John Falstaff.

**FORD.**
==11== Sir John Falstaff!

**MRS. PAGE.**
==12== He, he—I can never hit on ’s name. There is such a league between my goodman and he! Is your wife at home indeed?

**FORD.**
==13== Indeed she is.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==14== By your leave, sir. I am sick till I see her.

*Exeunt Mrs. Page and Robin.*

**FORD.**
==15== Has Page any brains? Hath he any eyes? Hath he any thinking? Sure they sleep, he hath no use of them. Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve score. He pieces out his wive’s inclination; he gives her folly motion and advantage; and now she’s going to my wife, and Falstaff’s boy with her. A man may hear this show’r sing in the wind. And Falstaff’s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid, and our revolted wives share damnation together. Well, I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck the borrow’d veil of modesty from the so-seeming Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and willful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all my neighbors shall cry aim.
*(Clock heard.)*
==16== The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me search—there I shall find Falstaff. I shall be rather prais’d for this than mock’d; for it is as positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is there. I will go.

*Enter Page, Shallow, Slender, Host, Evans, Caius, Rugby.*

**SHAL. AND PAGE. ETC.**
==17== Well met, Master Ford.

**FORD.**
==18== Trust me, a good knot. I have good cheer at home, and I pray you all go with me.

**SHAL.**
==19== I must excuse myself, Master Ford.

**SLEN.**
==20== And so must I, sir. We have appointed to dine with Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for more money than I’ll speak of.

**SHAL.**
==21== We have linger’d about a match between Anne Page and my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.

**SLEN.**
==22== I hope I have your good will, father Page.

**PAGE.**
==23== You have, Master Slender, I stand wholly for you; but my wife, Master Doctor, is for you altogether.

**CAIUS.**
==24== Ay, be-gar, and de maid is love-a me. My nursh-a Quickly tell me so mush.

**HOST.**
==25== What say you to young Master Fenton? He capers, he dances, he has eyes of youth; he writes verses, he speaks holiday, he smells April and May—he will carry’t, he will carry’t—’tis in his buttons—he will carry’t.

**PAGE.**
==26== Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is of no having. He kept company with the wild Prince and Poins; he is of too high a region, he knows too much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes with the finger of my substance. If he take her, let him take her simply. The wealth I have waits on my consent, and my consent goes not that way.

**FORD.**
==27== I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me to dinner. Besides your cheer, you shall have sport; I will show you a monster. Master Doctor, you shall go, so shall you, Master Page, and you, Sir Hugh.

**SHAL.**
==28== Well, fare you well. We shall have the freer wooing at Master Page’s.

*Exeunt Shallow and Slender.*

**CAIUS.**
==29== Go home, John Rugby, I come anon.

*Exit Rugby.*

**HOST.**
==30== Farewell, my hearts. I will to my honest knight Falstaff, and drink canary with him.

*Exit.*

**FORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==31== I think I shall drink in pipe-wine first with him; I’ll make him dance.—Will you go, gentles?

**PAGE., EVANS. AND CAIUS**
==32== Have with you to see this monster.

*Exeunt.*
