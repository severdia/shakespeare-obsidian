## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*A street leading to the Windsor Park.*

*Enter Mistress Page, Mistress Ford, Caius.*

**MRS. PAGE.**
==1==Master Doctor, my daughter is in green. When you see your time, take her by the hand, away with her to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before into the park; we two must go together.

**CAIUS.**
==2==I know vat I have to do. *Adieu*.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==3==Fare you well, sir.
*(Exit Caius.)*
==4==My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor’s marrying my daughter. But ’tis no matter; better a little chiding than a great deal of heart-break.

**MRS. FORD.**
==5==Where is Nan now, and her troop of fairies, and the Welsh devil Hugh?

**MRS. PAGE.**
==6==They are all couch’d in a pit hard by Herne’s oak, with obscur’d lights; which, at the very instant of Falstaff’s and our meeting, they will at once display to the night.

**MRS. FORD.**
==7==That cannot choose but amaze him.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==8==If he be not amaz’d, he will be mock’d; if he be amaz’d, he will every way be mock’d.

**MRS. FORD.**
==9==We’ll betray him finely.

**MRS. PAGE.**
==10==Against such lewdsters, and their lechery,
==11==Those that betray them do no treachery.

**MRS. FORD.**
==12==The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!

*Exeunt.*
