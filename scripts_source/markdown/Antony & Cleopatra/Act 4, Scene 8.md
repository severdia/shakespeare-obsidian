## Act 4, Scene 8
[[Act 4, Scene 7|← Act 4, Scene 7]] | [[Act 4, Scene 9|Act 4, Scene 9 →]]

*Under the walls of Alexandria.*

*Alarum. Enter Antony again, in a march, Scarus, with others.*

**ANT.**
==1==We have beat him to his camp. Run one before,
==2==And let the Queen know of our gests. Tomorrow,
==3==Before the sun shall see ’s, we’ll spill the blood
==4==That has today escap’d. I thank you all,
==5==For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
==6==Not as you serv’d the cause, but as’t had been
==7==Each man’s like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
==8==Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
==9==Tell them your feats, whilst they with joyful tears
==10==Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
==11==The honor’d gashes whole.
*(Enter Cleopatra attended.)*
*(To Scarus.)*
==11==                Give me thy hand;
==12==To this great fairy I’ll commend thy acts,
==13==Make her thanks bless thee.
*(To Cleopatra.)*
==13==              O thou day o’ th’ world,
==14==Chain mine arm’d neck, leap thou, attire and all,
==15==Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
==16==Ride on the pants triumphing!

**CLEO.**
==16==                Lord of lords!
==17==O infinite virtue, com’st thou smiling from
==18==The world’s great snare uncaught?

**ANT.**
==18==                  Mine nightingale,
==19==We have beat them to their beds. What, girl, though gray
==20==Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha’ we
==21==A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
==22==Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man,
==23==Commend unto his lips thy favoring hand.
==24==Kiss it, my warrior; he hath fought today
==25==As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
==26==Destroyed in such a shape.

**CLEO.**
==26==              I’ll give thee, friend,
==27==An armor all of gold; it was a king’s.

**ANT.**
==28==He has deserv’d it, were it carbuncled
==29==Like holy Phoebus’ car. Give me thy hand.
==30==Through Alexandria make a jolly march,
==31==Bear our hack’d targets like the men that owe them.
==32==Had our great palace the capacity
==33==To camp this host, we all would sup together,
==34==And drink carouses to the next day’s fate,
==35==Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
==36==With brazen din blast you the city’s ear,
==37==Make mingle with our rattling taborines,
==38==That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
==39==Applauding our approach.

*Exeunt.*
