## Act 4, Scene 9
[[Act 4, Scene 8|← Act 4, Scene 8]] | [[Act 4, Scene 10|Act 4, Scene 10 →]]

*Alexandria. Octavius Caesar’s camp.*

*Enter Caesar’s Sentry and his Company. Enobarbus follows.*

**CAES. SENT.**
If we be not reliev’d within this hour,
We must return to th’ court of guard. The night
Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
By th’ second hour i’ th’ morn.

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
                This last day was
A shrewd one to ’s.

**ENO.**
           O, bear me witness, night⁠—

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
What man is this?

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
           Stand close, and list him.

**ENO.**
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory: poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent.

**CAES. SENT.**
              Enobarbus?

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
                     Peace!
Hark further.

**ENO.**
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
Which being dried with grief will break to powder,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
Forgive me in thine own particular,
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive.
O Antony! O Antony!

*Dies.*

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
              Let’s speak to him.

**CAES. SENT.**
Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar.

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
           Let’s do so. But he sleeps.

**CAES. SENT.**
Swoonds rather, for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep.

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
              Go we to him.

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
Awake, sir, awake, speak to us.

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
                  Hear you, sir?

**CAES. SENT.**
The hand of death hath raught him.
*(Drums afar off.)*
                  Hark, the drums
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To th’ court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
Is fully out.

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
Come on then, he may recover yet.

*Exeunt with the body.*
