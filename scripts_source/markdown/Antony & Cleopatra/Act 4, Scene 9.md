## Act 4, Scene 9
[[Act 4, Scene 8|← Act 4, Scene 8]] | [[Act 4, Scene 10|Act 4, Scene 10 →]]

*Alexandria. Octavius Caesar’s camp.*

*Enter Caesar’s Sentry and his Company. Enobarbus follows.*

**CAES. SENT.**
==1==If we be not reliev’d within this hour,
==2==We must return to th’ court of guard. The night
==3==Is shiny, and they say we shall embattle
==4==By th’ second hour i’ th’ morn.

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
==4==                This last day was
==5==A shrewd one to ’s.

**ENO.**
==5==           O, bear me witness, night⁠—

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
==6==What man is this?

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
==6==           Stand close, and list him.

**ENO.**
==7==Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
==8==When men revolted shall upon record
==9==Bear hateful memory: poor Enobarbus did
==10==Before thy face repent.

**CAES. SENT.**
==10==              Enobarbus?

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
==10==                     Peace!
==11==Hark further.

**ENO.**
==12==O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
==13==The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
==14==That life, a very rebel to my will,
==15==May hang no longer on me. Throw my heart
==16==Against the flint and hardness of my fault,
==17==Which being dried with grief will break to powder,
==18==And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
==19==Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
==20==Forgive me in thine own particular,
==21==But let the world rank me in register
==22==A master-leaver and a fugitive.
==23==O Antony! O Antony!

*Dies.*

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
==23==              Let’s speak to him.

**CAES. SENT.**
==24==Let’s hear him, for the things he speaks
==25==May concern Caesar.

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
==25==           Let’s do so. But he sleeps.

**CAES. SENT.**
==26==Swoonds rather, for so bad a prayer as his
==27==Was never yet for sleep.

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
==27==              Go we to him.

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
==28==Awake, sir, awake, speak to us.

**CAES. 1. WATCH.**
==28==                  Hear you, sir?

**CAES. SENT.**
==29==The hand of death hath raught him.
*(Drums afar off.)*
==29==                  Hark, the drums
==30==Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
==31==To th’ court of guard; he is of note. Our hour
==32==Is fully out.

**CAES. 2. WATCH.**
==33==Come on then, he may recover yet.

*Exeunt with the body.*
