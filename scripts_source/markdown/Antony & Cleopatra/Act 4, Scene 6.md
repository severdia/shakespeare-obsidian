## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 7|Act 4, Scene 7 →]]

*Alexandria. Octavius Caesar’s camp.*

*Flourish. Enter Agrippa, Caesar, with Enobarbus and Dolabella.*

**CAES.**
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
Our will is Antony be took alive;
Make it so known.

**AGR.**
           Caesar, I shall.

*Exit.*

**CAES.**
The time of universal peace is near.
Prove this a prosp’rous day, the three-nook’d world
Shall bear the olive freely.

*Enter Caesar’s Third Messenger.*

**3. CAES. MESS.**
              Antony
Is come into the field.

**CAES.**
              Go charge Agrippa
Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
That Antony may seem to spend his fury
Upon himself.

*Exeunt all but Enobarbus.*

**ENO.**
Alexas did revolt, and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony, there did dissuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
And leave his master Antony; for this pains
Caesar hath hang’d him. Canidius and the rest
That fell away have entertainment, but
No honorable trust. I have done ill,
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
That I will joy no more.

*Enter Caesar’s First Soldier.*

**CAES. 1. SOLD.**
              Enobarbus, Antony
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
His bounty overplus. The messenger
Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
Unloading of his mules.

**ENO.**
              I give it you.

**CAES. 1. SOLD.**
Mock not, Enobarbus,
I tell you true. Best you saf’d the bringer
Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
Or would have done’t myself. Your emperor
Continues still a Jove.

*Exit.*

**ENO.**
I am alone the villain of the earth,
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
My better service, when my turpitude
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
Shall outstrike thought, but thought will do’t, I feel.
I fight against thee? No, I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul’st best fits
My latter part of life.

*Exit.*
