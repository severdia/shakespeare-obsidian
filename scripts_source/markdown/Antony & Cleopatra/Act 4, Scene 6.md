## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 7|Act 4, Scene 7 →]]

*Alexandria. Octavius Caesar’s camp.*

*Flourish. Enter Agrippa, Caesar, with Enobarbus and Dolabella.*

**CAES.**
==1==Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.
==2==Our will is Antony be took alive;
==3==Make it so known.

**AGR.**
==3==           Caesar, I shall.

*Exit.*

**CAES.**
==4==The time of universal peace is near.
==5==Prove this a prosp’rous day, the three-nook’d world
==6==Shall bear the olive freely.

*Enter Caesar’s Third Messenger.*

**3. CAES. MESS.**
==6==              Antony
==7==Is come into the field.

**CAES.**
==7==              Go charge Agrippa
==8==Plant those that have revolted in the vant,
==9==That Antony may seem to spend his fury
==10==Upon himself.

*Exeunt all but Enobarbus.*

**ENO.**
==11==Alexas did revolt, and went to Jewry on
==12==Affairs of Antony, there did dissuade
==13==Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
==14==And leave his master Antony; for this pains
==15==Caesar hath hang’d him. Canidius and the rest
==16==That fell away have entertainment, but
==17==No honorable trust. I have done ill,
==18==Of which I do accuse myself so sorely
==19==That I will joy no more.

*Enter Caesar’s First Soldier.*

**CAES. 1. SOLD.**
==19==              Enobarbus, Antony
==20==Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
==21==His bounty overplus. The messenger
==22==Came on my guard, and at thy tent is now
==23==Unloading of his mules.

**ENO.**
==23==              I give it you.

**CAES. 1. SOLD.**
==24==Mock not, Enobarbus,
==25==I tell you true. Best you saf’d the bringer
==26==Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
==27==Or would have done’t myself. Your emperor
==28==Continues still a Jove.

*Exit.*

**ENO.**
==29==I am alone the villain of the earth,
==30==And feel I am so most. O Antony,
==31==Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
==32==My better service, when my turpitude
==33==Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart.
==34==If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
==35==Shall outstrike thought, but thought will do’t, I feel.
==36==I fight against thee? No, I will go seek
==37==Some ditch wherein to die; the foul’st best fits
==38==My latter part of life.

*Exit.*
