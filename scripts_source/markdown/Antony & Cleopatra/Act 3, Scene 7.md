## Act 3, Scene 7
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 3, Scene 8|Act 3, Scene 8 →]]

*Near Actium. Mark Antony’s camp.*

*Enter Cleopatra and Enobarbus.*

**CLEO.**
==1==I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

**ENO.**
==2==But why, why, why?

**CLEO.**
==3==Thou hast forespoke my being in these wars,
==4==And say’st it is not fit.

**ENO.**
==4==              Well; is it, is it?

**CLEO.**
==5==If not denounc’d against us, why should not we
==6==Be there in person?

**ENO.**
*(Aside.)*
==6==           Well, I could reply:
==7==If we should serve with horse and mares together,
==8==The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
==9==A soldier and his horse.

**CLEO.**
==9==              What is’t you say?

**ENO.**
==10==Your presence needs must puzzle Antony,
==11==Take from his heart, take from his brain, from ’s time,
==12==What should not then be spar’d. He is already
==13==Traduc’d for levity, and ’tis said in Rome
==14==That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
==15==Manage this war.

**CLEO.**
==15==        Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
==16==That speak against us! A charge we bear i’ th’ war,
==17==And as the president of my kingdom will
==18==Appear there for a man. Speak not against it,
==19==I will not stay behind.

*Enter Antony and Canidius.*

**ENO.**
==19==              Nay, I have done,
==20==Here comes the Emperor.

**ANT.**
==20==              Is it not strange, Canidius,
==21==That from Tarentum and Brundusium
==22==He could so quickly cut the Ionian Sea,
==23==And take in Toryne? You have heard on’t, sweet?

**CLEO.**
==24==Celerity is never more admir’d
==25==Than by the negligent.

**ANT.**
==25==              A good rebuke,
==26==Which might have well becom’d the best of men,
==27==To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
==28==Will fight with him by sea.

**CLEO.**
==28==              By sea, what else?

**CAN.**
==29==Why will my lord do so?

**ANT.**
==29==              For that he dares us to’t.

**ENO.**
==30==So hath my lord dar’d him to single fight.

**CAN.**
==31==Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia,
==32==Where Caesar fought with Pompey. But these offers,
==33==Which serve not for his vantage, he shakes off,
==34==And so should you.

**ENO.**
==34==           Your ships are not well mann’d,
==35==Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
==36==Ingross’d by swift impress. In Caesar’s fleet
==37==Are those that often have ’gainst Pompey fought;
==38==Their ships are yare, yours heavy. No disgrace
==39==Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
==40==Being prepar’d for land.

**ANT.**
==40==              By sea, by sea.

**ENO.**
==41==Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
==42==The absolute soldiership you have by land,
==43==Distract your army, which doth most consist
==44==Of war-mark’d footmen, leave unexecuted
==45==Your own renowned knowledge, quite forgo
==46==The way which promises assurance, and
==47==Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
==48==From firm security.

**ANT.**
==48==           I’ll fight at sea.

**CLEO.**
==49==I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

**ANT.**
==50==Our overplus of shipping will we burn,
==51==And, with the rest full-mann’d, from th’ head of Actium
==52==Beat th’ approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
==53==We then can do’t at land.
*(Enter Second Roman Messenger.)*
==53==              Thy business?

**2. ROM. MESS.**
==54==The news is true, my lord: he is descried;
==55==Caesar has taken Toryne.

**ANT.**
==56==Can he be there in person? ’Tis impossible
==57==Strange that his power should be. Canidius,
==58==Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
==59==And our twelve thousand horse. We’ll to our ship,
==60==Away, my Thetis!
*(Exit Second Roman Messenger.)*
*(Enter Scarus.)*
==60==           How now, worthy soldier?

**SCAR.**
==61==O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea,
==62==Trust not to rotten planks. Do you misdoubt
==63==This sword, and these my wounds? Let th’ Egyptians
==64==And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
==65==Have us’d to conquer standing on the earth,
==66==And fighting foot to foot.

**ANT.**
==66==              Well, well, away!

*Exeunt Antony, Cleopatra, and Enobarbus.*

**SCAR.**
==67==By Hercules, I think I am i’ th’ right.

**CAN.**
==68==Soldier, thou art; but his whole action grows
==69==Not in the power on’t. So our leader’s led,
==70==And we are women’s men.

**SCAR.**
==70==              You keep by land
==71==The legions and the horse whole, do you not?

**CAN.**
==72==Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
==73==Publicola, and Caelius are for sea;
==74==But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar’s
==75==Carries beyond belief.

**SCAR.**
==75==              While he was yet in Rome,
==76==His power went out in such distractions as
==77==Beguil’d all spies.

**CAN.**
==77==           Who’s his lieutenant, hear you?

**SCAR.**
==78==They say, one Taurus.

**CAN.**
==78==              Well I know the man.

*Enter Second Roman Messenger.*

**2. ROM. MESS.**
==79==The Emperor calls Canidius.

**CAN.**
==80==With news the time’s with labor, and throes forth
==81==Each minute some.

*Exeunt.*
