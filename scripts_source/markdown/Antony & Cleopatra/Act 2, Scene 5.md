## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.*

**CLEO.**
Give me some music; music, moody food
Of us that trade in love.

**CHAR., IRAS, ALEX.**
              The music, ho!

*Enter Mardian the Eunuch.*

**CLEO.**
Let it alone, let’s to billards. Come, Charmian.

**CHAR.**
My arm is sore, best play with Mardian.

**CLEO.**
As well a woman with an eunuch play’d
As with a woman. Come, you’ll play with me, sir?

**MAR.**
As well as I can, madam.

**CLEO.**
And when good will is show’d, though’t come too short,
The actor may plead pardon. I’ll none now.
Give me mine angle, we’ll to th’ river; there,
My music playing far off, I will betray
Tawny-finn’d fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up,
I’ll think them every one an Antony,
And say, “Ah, ha! Y’ are caught.”

**CHAR.**
                  ’Twas merry when
You wager’d on your angling; when your diver
Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
With fervency drew up.

**CLEO.**
              That time? O times!
I laugh’d him out of patience; and that night
I laugh’d him into patience; and next morn,
Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
I wore his sword Philippan.
*(Enter an Egyptian Messenger.)*
                O, from Italy!
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
That long time have been barren.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
                  Madam, madam⁠—

**CLEO.**
Antonio’s dead! If thou say so, villain,
Thou kill’st thy mistress; but well and free,
If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
My bluest veins to kiss—a hand that kings
Have lipp’d, and trembled kissing.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
First, madam, he is well.

**CLEO.**
              Why, there’s more gold.
But, sirrah, mark, we use
To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
Down thy ill-uttering throat.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Good madam, hear me.

**CLEO.**
              Well, go to, I will.
But there’s no goodness in thy face, if Antony
Be free and healthful—so tart a favor
To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown’d with snakes,
Not like a formal man.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
              Will’t please you hear me?

**CLEO.**
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st;
Yet if thou say Antony lives, ’tis well,
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
I’ll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
Rich pearls upon thee.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
           Madam, he’s well.

**CLEO.**
                       Well said.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
And friends with Caesar.

**CLEO.**
              Th’ art an honest man.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

**CLEO.**
Make thee a fortune from me.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
                But yet, madam⁠—

**CLEO.**
I do not like “but yet,” it does allay
The good precedence; fie upon “but yet”!
“But yet” is as a jailer to bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
The good and bad together: he’s friends with Caesar,
In state of health thou say’st, and thou say’st free.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Free, madam, no; I made no such report.
He’s bound unto Octavia.

**CLEO.**
              For what good turn?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
For the best turn i’ th’ bed.

**CLEO.**
              I am pale, Charmian.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Madam, he’s married to Octavia.

**CLEO.**
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!

*Strikes him down.*

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Good madam, patience.

**CLEO.**
              What say you?
*(Strikes him.)*
                         Hence,
Horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes
Like balls before me; I’ll unhair thy head,
*(She hales him up and down.)*
Thou shalt be whipt with wire, and stew’d in brine,
Smarting in ling’ring pickle.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
                Gracious madam,
I that do bring the news made not the match.

**CLEO.**
Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee,
And make thy fortunes proud; the blow thou hadst
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage,
And I will boot thee with what gift beside
Thy modesty can beg.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
           He’s married, madam.

**CLEO.**
Rogue, thou hast liv’d too long.

*Draw a knife.*

**EGYPT. MESS.**
                  Nay then I’ll run.
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.

*Exit.*

**CHAR.**
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself,
The man is innocent.

**CLEO.**
Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt into Nile! And kindly creatures
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again,
Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!

**CHAR.**
He is afeard to come.

**CLEO.**
           I will not hurt him.
These hands do lack nobility that they strike
A meaner than myself, since I myself
Have given myself the cause. Come hither, sir.
*(Enter the Egyptian Messenger again.)*
Though it be honest, it is never good
To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message
An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell
Themselves when they be felt.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
                I have done my duty.

**CLEO.**
Is he married?
I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
If thou again say yes.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
           He’s married, madam.

**CLEO.**
The gods confound thee, dost thou hold there still?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Should I lie, madam?

**CLEO.**
           O, I would thou didst;
So half my Egypt were submerg’d and made
A cistern for scal’d snakes! Go get thee hence!
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
I crave your Highness’ pardon.

**CLEO.**
                  He is married?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Take no offense that I would not offend you;
To punish me for what you make me do
Seems much unequal. He’s married to Octavia.

**CLEO.**
O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
That art not what th’ art sure of. Get thee hence;
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,
And be undone by ’em!

*Exit Egyptian Messenger.*

**CHAR.**
              Good your Highness, patience.

**CLEO.**
In praising Antony I have disprais’d Caesar.

**CHAR.**
Many times, madam.

**CLEO.**
           I am paid for’t now.
Lead me from hence;
I faint, O Iras, Charmian! ’Tis no matter.
Go to the fellow, good Alexas, bid him
Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
Her inclination; let him not leave out
The color of her hair. Bring me word quickly.
*(Exit Alexas.)*
Let him forever go—let him not, Charmian⁠—
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
The other way’s a Mars.
*(To Mardian.)*
              Bid you Alexas
Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

*Exeunt.*
