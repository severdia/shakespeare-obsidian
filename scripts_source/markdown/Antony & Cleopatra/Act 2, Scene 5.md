## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.*

**CLEO.**
==1==Give me some music; music, moody food
==2==Of us that trade in love.

**CHAR., IRAS, ALEX.**
==2==              The music, ho!

*Enter Mardian the Eunuch.*

**CLEO.**
==3==Let it alone, let’s to billards. Come, Charmian.

**CHAR.**
==4==My arm is sore, best play with Mardian.

**CLEO.**
==5==As well a woman with an eunuch play’d
==6==As with a woman. Come, you’ll play with me, sir?

**MAR.**
==7==As well as I can, madam.

**CLEO.**
==8==And when good will is show’d, though’t come too short,
==9==The actor may plead pardon. I’ll none now.
==10==Give me mine angle, we’ll to th’ river; there,
==11==My music playing far off, I will betray
==12==Tawny-finn’d fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
==13==Their slimy jaws; and as I draw them up,
==14==I’ll think them every one an Antony,
==15==And say, “Ah, ha! Y’ are caught.”

**CHAR.**
==15==                  ’Twas merry when
==16==You wager’d on your angling; when your diver
==17==Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
==18==With fervency drew up.

**CLEO.**
==18==              That time? O times!
==19==I laugh’d him out of patience; and that night
==20==I laugh’d him into patience; and next morn,
==21==Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
==22==Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
==23==I wore his sword Philippan.
*(Enter an Egyptian Messenger.)*
==23==                O, from Italy!
==24==Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
==25==That long time have been barren.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==25==                  Madam, madam⁠—

**CLEO.**
==26==Antonio’s dead! If thou say so, villain,
==27==Thou kill’st thy mistress; but well and free,
==28==If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
==29==My bluest veins to kiss—a hand that kings
==30==Have lipp’d, and trembled kissing.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==31==First, madam, he is well.

**CLEO.**
==31==              Why, there’s more gold.
==32==But, sirrah, mark, we use
==33==To say the dead are well. Bring it to that,
==34==The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
==35==Down thy ill-uttering throat.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==36==Good madam, hear me.

**CLEO.**
==36==              Well, go to, I will.
==37==But there’s no goodness in thy face, if Antony
==38==Be free and healthful—so tart a favor
==39==To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
==40==Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown’d with snakes,
==41==Not like a formal man.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==41==              Will’t please you hear me?

**CLEO.**
==42==I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak’st;
==43==Yet if thou say Antony lives, ’tis well,
==44==Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
==45==I’ll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
==46==Rich pearls upon thee.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==46==           Madam, he’s well.

**CLEO.**
==46==                       Well said.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==47==And friends with Caesar.

**CLEO.**
==47==              Th’ art an honest man.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==48==Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

**CLEO.**
==49==Make thee a fortune from me.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==49==                But yet, madam⁠—

**CLEO.**
==50==I do not like “but yet,” it does allay
==51==The good precedence; fie upon “but yet”!
==52==“But yet” is as a jailer to bring forth
==53==Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
==54==Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
==55==The good and bad together: he’s friends with Caesar,
==56==In state of health thou say’st, and thou say’st free.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==57==Free, madam, no; I made no such report.
==58==He’s bound unto Octavia.

**CLEO.**
==58==              For what good turn?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==59==For the best turn i’ th’ bed.

**CLEO.**
==59==              I am pale, Charmian.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==60==Madam, he’s married to Octavia.

**CLEO.**
==61==The most infectious pestilence upon thee!

*Strikes him down.*

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==62==Good madam, patience.

**CLEO.**
==62==              What say you?
*(Strikes him.)*
==62==                         Hence,
==63==Horrible villain, or I’ll spurn thine eyes
==64==Like balls before me; I’ll unhair thy head,
*(She hales him up and down.)*
==65==Thou shalt be whipt with wire, and stew’d in brine,
==66==Smarting in ling’ring pickle.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==66==                Gracious madam,
==67==I that do bring the news made not the match.

**CLEO.**
==68==Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee,
==69==And make thy fortunes proud; the blow thou hadst
==70==Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage,
==71==And I will boot thee with what gift beside
==72==Thy modesty can beg.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==72==           He’s married, madam.

**CLEO.**
==73==Rogue, thou hast liv’d too long.

*Draw a knife.*

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==73==                  Nay then I’ll run.
==74==What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.

*Exit.*

**CHAR.**
==75==Good madam, keep yourself within yourself,
==76==The man is innocent.

**CLEO.**
==77==Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt.
==78==Melt Egypt into Nile! And kindly creatures
==79==Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again,
==80==Though I am mad, I will not bite him. Call!

**CHAR.**
==81==He is afeard to come.

**CLEO.**
==81==           I will not hurt him.
==82==These hands do lack nobility that they strike
==83==A meaner than myself, since I myself
==84==Have given myself the cause. Come hither, sir.
*(Enter the Egyptian Messenger again.)*
==85==Though it be honest, it is never good
==86==To bring bad news. Give to a gracious message
==87==An host of tongues, but let ill tidings tell
==88==Themselves when they be felt.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==88==                I have done my duty.

**CLEO.**
==89==Is he married?
==90==I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
==91==If thou again say yes.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==91==           He’s married, madam.

**CLEO.**
==92==The gods confound thee, dost thou hold there still?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==93==Should I lie, madam?

**CLEO.**
==93==           O, I would thou didst;
==94==So half my Egypt were submerg’d and made
==95==A cistern for scal’d snakes! Go get thee hence!
==96==Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
==97==Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==98==I crave your Highness’ pardon.

**CLEO.**
==98==                  He is married?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==99==Take no offense that I would not offend you;
==100==To punish me for what you make me do
==101==Seems much unequal. He’s married to Octavia.

**CLEO.**
==102==O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
==103==That art not what th’ art sure of. Get thee hence;
==104==The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
==105==Are all too dear for me. Lie they upon thy hand,
==106==And be undone by ’em!

*Exit Egyptian Messenger.*

**CHAR.**
==106==              Good your Highness, patience.

**CLEO.**
==107==In praising Antony I have disprais’d Caesar.

**CHAR.**
==108==Many times, madam.

**CLEO.**
==108==           I am paid for’t now.
==109==Lead me from hence;
==110==I faint, O Iras, Charmian! ’Tis no matter.
==111==Go to the fellow, good Alexas, bid him
==112==Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
==113==Her inclination; let him not leave out
==114==The color of her hair. Bring me word quickly.
*(Exit Alexas.)*
==115==Let him forever go—let him not, Charmian⁠—
==116==Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
==117==The other way’s a Mars.
*(To Mardian.)*
==117==              Bid you Alexas
==118==Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
==119==But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

*Exeunt.*
