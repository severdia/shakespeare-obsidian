## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Mardian.*

**CLEO.**
==1==Charmian!

**CHAR.**
==2==Madam?

**CLEO.**
==3==Ha, ha!
==4==Give me to drink mandragora.

**CHAR.**
==4==                Why, madam?

**CLEO.**
==5==That I might sleep out this great gap of time
==6==My Antony is away.

**CHAR.**
==6==           You think of him too much.

**CLEO.**
==7==O, ’tis treason!

**CHAR.**
==7==        Madam, I trust not so.

**CLEO.**
==8==Thou, eunuch Mardian!

**MAR.**
==8==              What’s your Highness’ pleasure?

**CLEO.**
==9==Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure
==10==In aught an eunuch has. ’Tis well for thee,
==11==That being unseminar’d, thy freer thoughts
==12==May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

**MAR.**
==13==Yes, gracious madam.

**CLEO.**
==14==Indeed?

**MAR.**
==15==Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing
==16==But what indeed is honest to be done;
==17==Yet have I fierce affections, and think
==18==What Venus did with Mars.

**CLEO.**
==18==                O Charmian!
==19==Where think’st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
==20==Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?
==21==O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
==22==Do bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou mov’st?
==23==The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
==24==And burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,
==25==Or murmuring, “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”
==26==(For so he calls me). Now I feed myself
==27==With most delicious poison. Think on me,
==28==That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black,
==29==And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
==30==When thou wast here above the ground, I was
==31==A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
==32==Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
==33==There would he anchor his aspect, and die
==34==With looking on his life.

*Enter Alexas from Antony.*

**ALEX.**
==34==              Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

**CLEO.**
==35==How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
==36==Yet coming from him, that great med’cine hath
==37==With his tinct gilded thee.
==38==How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

**ALEX.**
==39==Last thing he did, dear Queen,
==40==He kiss’d—the last of many doubled kisses⁠—
==41==This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

**CLEO.**
==42==Mine ear must pluck it thence.

**ALEX.**
==42==                “Good friend,” quoth he,
==43==“Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
==44==This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
==45==To mend the petty present, I will piece
==46==Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
==47==Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded,
==48==And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
==49==Who neigh’d so high that what I would have spoke
==50==Was beastly dumb’d by him.

**CLEO.**
==50==                What, was he sad, or merry?

**ALEX.**
==51==Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes
==52==Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.

**CLEO.**
==53==O well-divided disposition! Note him,
==54==Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man; but note him:
==55==He was not sad, for he would shine on those
==56==That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
==57==Which seem’d to tell them his remembrance lay
==58==In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
==59==O heavenly mingle! Be’st thou sad or merry,
==60==The violence of either thee becomes,
==61==So does it no man’s else. Met’st thou my posts?

**ALEX.**
==62==Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
==63==Why do you send so thick?

**CLEO.**
==63==              Who’s born that day
==64==When I forget to send to Antony,
==65==Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
==66==Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
==67==Ever love Caesar so?

**CHAR.**
==67==           O that brave Caesar!

**CLEO.**
==68==Be chok’d with such another emphasis!
==69==Say “the brave Antony.”

**CHAR.**
==69==              The valiant Caesar!

**CLEO.**
==70==By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
==71==If thou with Caesar paragon again
==72==My man of men.

**CHAR.**
==72==           By your most gracious pardon,
==73==I sing but after you.

**CLEO.**
==73==           My salad days,
==74==When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
==75==To say as I said then! But come, away,
==76==Get me ink and paper.
==77==He shall have every day a several greeting,
==78==Or I’ll unpeople Egypt.

*Exeunt.*
