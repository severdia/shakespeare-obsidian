## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Mardian.*

**CLEO.**
Charmian!

**CHAR.**
Madam?

**CLEO.**
Ha, ha!
Give me to drink mandragora.

**CHAR.**
                Why, madam?

**CLEO.**
That I might sleep out this great gap of time
My Antony is away.

**CHAR.**
           You think of him too much.

**CLEO.**
O, ’tis treason!

**CHAR.**
        Madam, I trust not so.

**CLEO.**
Thou, eunuch Mardian!

**MAR.**
              What’s your Highness’ pleasure?

**CLEO.**
Not now to hear thee sing. I take no pleasure
In aught an eunuch has. ’Tis well for thee,
That being unseminar’d, thy freer thoughts
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

**MAR.**
Yes, gracious madam.

**CLEO.**
Indeed?

**MAR.**
Not in deed, madam, for I can do nothing
But what indeed is honest to be done;
Yet have I fierce affections, and think
What Venus did with Mars.

**CLEO.**
                O Charmian!
Where think’st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
Or does he walk? Or is he on his horse?
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
Do bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou mov’st?
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
And burgonet of men. He’s speaking now,
Or murmuring, “Where’s my serpent of old Nile?”
(For so he calls me). Now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me,
That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
A morsel for a monarch; and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
There would he anchor his aspect, and die
With looking on his life.

*Enter Alexas from Antony.*

**ALEX.**
              Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

**CLEO.**
How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
Yet coming from him, that great med’cine hath
With his tinct gilded thee.
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

**ALEX.**
Last thing he did, dear Queen,
He kiss’d—the last of many doubled kisses⁠—
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

**CLEO.**
Mine ear must pluck it thence.

**ALEX.**
                “Good friend,” quoth he,
“Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
To mend the petty present, I will piece
Her opulent throne with kingdoms. All the East,
Say thou, shall call her mistress.” So he nodded,
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
Who neigh’d so high that what I would have spoke
Was beastly dumb’d by him.

**CLEO.**
                What, was he sad, or merry?

**ALEX.**
Like to the time o’ th’ year between the extremes
Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.

**CLEO.**
O well-divided disposition! Note him,
Note him, good Charmian, ’tis the man; but note him:
He was not sad, for he would shine on those
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
Which seem’d to tell them his remembrance lay
In Egypt with his joy; but between both.
O heavenly mingle! Be’st thou sad or merry,
The violence of either thee becomes,
So does it no man’s else. Met’st thou my posts?

**ALEX.**
Ay, madam, twenty several messengers.
Why do you send so thick?

**CLEO.**
              Who’s born that day
When I forget to send to Antony,
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Caesar so?

**CHAR.**
           O that brave Caesar!

**CLEO.**
Be chok’d with such another emphasis!
Say “the brave Antony.”

**CHAR.**
              The valiant Caesar!

**CLEO.**
By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
If thou with Caesar paragon again
My man of men.

**CHAR.**
           By your most gracious pardon,
I sing but after you.

**CLEO.**
           My salad days,
When I was green in judgment, cold in blood,
To say as I said then! But come, away,
Get me ink and paper.
He shall have every day a several greeting,
Or I’ll unpeople Egypt.

*Exeunt.*
