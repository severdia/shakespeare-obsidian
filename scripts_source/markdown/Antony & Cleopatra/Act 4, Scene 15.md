## Act 4, Scene 15
[[Act 4, Scene 14|← Act 4, Scene 14]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Alexandria. Another room in a monument in Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra and her maids aloft, with Charmian and Iras.*

**CLEO.**
==1==O Charmian, I will never go from hence.

**CHAR.**
==2==Be comforted, dear madam.

**CLEO.**
==2==                No, I will not.
==3==All strange and terrible events are welcome,
==4==But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
==5==Proportion’d to our cause, must be as great
==6==As that which makes it.
*(Enter Diomed below.)*
==6==              How now? Is he dead?

**DIO.**
==7==His death’s upon him, but not dead.
==8==Look out o’ th’ other side your monument,
==9==His guard have brought him thither.

*Enter below Antony, and the Guard bearing him.*

**CLEO.**
==9==                     O sun,
==10==Burn the great sphere thou mov’st in! Darkling stand
==11==The varying shore o’ th’ world! O Antony,
==12==Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
==13==Help, friends below, let’s draw him hither.

**ANT.**
==13==                       Peace!
==14==Not Caesar’s valor hath o’erthrown Antony,
==15==But Antony’s hath triumph’d on itself.

**CLEO.**
==16==So it should be, that none but Antony
==17==Should conquer Antony, but woe ’tis so!

**ANT.**
==18==I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
==19==I here importune death awhile, until
==20==Of many thousand kisses the poor last
==21==I lay upon thy lips.

**CLEO.**
==21==           I dare not, dear⁠—
==22==Dear my lord, pardon—I dare not,
==23==Lest I be taken. Not th’ imperious show
==24==Of the full-fortun’d Caesar ever shall
==25==Be brooch’d with me, if knife, drugs, serpents have
==26==Edge, sting, or operation. I am safe:
==27==Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
==28==And still conclusion, shall acquire no honor
==29==Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony⁠—
==30==Help me, my women—we must draw thee up.
==31==Assist, good friends.

**ANT.**
==31==           O, quick, or I am gone.

**CLEO.**
==32==Here’s sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
==33==Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
==34==That makes the weight. Had I great Juno’s power,
==35==The strong-wing’d Mercury should fetch thee up,
==36==And set thee by Jove’s side. Yet come a little⁠—
==37==Wishers were ever fools—O, come, come, come,
*(They heave Antony aloft to Cleopatra.)*
==38==And welcome, welcome! Die when thou hast liv’d,
==39==Quicken with kissing. Had my lips that power,
==40==Thus would I wear them out.

**ALL GUARDS.**
==40==                A heavy sight!

**ANT.**
==41==I am dying, Egypt, dying.
==42==Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

**CLEO.**
==43==No, let me speak, and let me rail so high,
==44==That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel,
==45==Provok’d by my offense.

**ANT.**
==45==              One word, sweet queen:
==46==Of Caesar seek your honor, with your safety. O!

**CLEO.**
==47==They do not go together.

**ANT.**
==47==              Gentle, hear me:
==48==None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

**CLEO.**
==49==My resolution and my hands I’ll trust,
==50==None about Caesar.

**ANT.**
==51==The miserable change now at my end
==52==Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
==53==In feeding them with those my former fortunes
==54==Wherein I liv’d, the greatest prince o’ th’ world,
==55==The noblest; and do now not basely die,
==56==Not cowardly put off my helmet to
==57==My countryman—a Roman by a Roman
==58==Valiantly vanquish’d. Now my spirit is going,
==59==I can no more.

**CLEO.**
==59==        Noblest of men, woo’t die?
==60==Hast thou no care of me? Shall I abide
==61==In this dull world, which in thy absence is
==62==No better than a sty? O, see, my women:
*(Antony dies.)*
==63==The crown o’ th’ earth doth melt. My lord!
==64==O, wither’d is the garland of the war,
==65==The soldier’s pole is fall’n! Young boys and girls
==66==Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
==67==And there is nothing left remarkable
==68==Beneath the visiting moon.

*Faints.*

**CHAR.**
==68==                O, quietness, lady!

**IRAS.**
==69==She’s dead too, our sovereign.

**CHAR.**
==69==                Lady!

**IRAS.**
==69==                     Madam!

**CHAR.**
==70==O madam, madam, madam!

**IRAS.**
==70==                Royal Egypt!
==71==Empress!

**CHAR.**
==72==Peace, peace, Iras!

**CLEO.**
==73==No more but e’en a woman, and commanded
==74==By such poor passion as the maid that milks
==75==And does the meanest chores. It were for me
==76==To throw my scepter at the injurious gods,
==77==To tell them that this world did equal theirs
==78==Till they had stol’n our jewel. All’s but naught:
==79==Patience is sottish, and impatience does
==80==Become a dog that’s mad. Then is it sin
==81==To rush into the secret house of death
==82==Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
==83==What, what, good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian?
==84==My noble girls! Ah, women, women! Look
==85==Our lamp is spent, it’s out. Good sirs, take heart,
==86==We’ll bury him; and then, what’s brave, what’s noble,
==87==Let’s do’t after the high Roman fashion,
==88==And make death proud to take us. Come, away,
==89==This case of that huge spirit now is cold.
==90==Ah, women, women! Come, we have no friend
==91==But resolution and the briefest end.

*Exeunt, those above bearing off Antony’s body.*
