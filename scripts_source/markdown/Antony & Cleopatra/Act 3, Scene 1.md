## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 7|← Act 2, Scene 7]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*A plain in Syria.*

*Enter Ventidius as it were in triumph with Silius and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers, the dead body of Pacorus borne before him.*

**VEN.**
==1== Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck, and now
==2== Pleas’d Fortune does of Marcus Crassus’ death
==3== Make me revenger. Bear the King’s son’s body
==4== Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
==5== Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

**SIL.**
==5==                 Noble Ventidius,
==6== Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
==7== The fugitive Parthians follow. Spur through Media,
==8== Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
==9== The routed fly; so thy grand captain, Antony,
==10== Shall set thee on triumphant chariots, and
==11== Put garlands on thy head.

**VEN.**
==11==               O Silius, Silius,
==12== I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
==13== May make too great an act. For learn this, Silius:
==14== Better to leave undone, than by our deed
==15== Acquire too high a fame when him we serve’s away.
==16== Caesar and Antony have ever won
==17== More in their officer than person. Sossius,
==18== One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
==19== For quick accumulation of renown,
==20== Which he achiev’d by th’ minute, lost his favor.
==21== Who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can
==22== Becomes his captain’s captain; and ambition
==23== (The soldier’s virtue) rather makes choice of loss
==24== Than gain which darkens him.
==25== I could do more to do Antonius good,
==26== But ’twould offend him; and in his offense
==27== Should my performance perish.

**SIL.**
==27==                 Thou hast, Ventidius, that
==28== Without the which a soldier and his sword
==29== Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony?

**VEN.**
==30== I’ll humbly signify what in his name,
==31== That magical word of war, we have effected;
==32== How with his banners, and his well-paid ranks,
==33== The ne’er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
==34== We have jaded out o’ th’ field.

**SIL.**
==34==                 Where is he now?

**VEN.**
==35== He purposeth to Athens, whither, with what haste
==36== The weight we must convey with ’s will permit,
==37== We shall appear before him. On, there, pass along!

*Exeunt.*
