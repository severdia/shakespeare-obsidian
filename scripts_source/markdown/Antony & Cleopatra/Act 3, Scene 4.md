## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*Athens. A room in Antony’s house.*

*Enter Antony and Octavia.*

**ANT.**
==1== Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that⁠—
==2== That were excusable, that, and thousands more
==3== Of semblable import—but he hath wag’d
==4== New wars ’gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
==5== To public ear;
==6== Spoke scantly of me; when perforce he could not
==7== But pay me terms of honor, cold and sickly
==8== He vented them, most narrow measure lent me;
==9== When the best hint was given him, he not took’t,
==10== Or did it from his teeth.

**OCT.**
==10==               O my good lord,
==11== Believe not all, or if you must believe,
==12== Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
==13== If this division chance, ne’er stood between,
==14== Praying for both parts.
==15== The good gods will mock me presently,
==16== When I shall pray, “O, bless my lord and husband!”
==17== Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
==18== “O, bless my brother!” Husband win, win brother,
==19== Prays, and destroys the prayer, no midway
==20== ’Twixt these extremes at all.

**ANT.**
==20==                 Gentle Octavia,
==21== Let your best love draw to that point which seeks
==22== Best to preserve it. If I lose mine honor,
==23== I lose myself; better I were not yours
==24== Than yours so branchless. But as you requested,
==25== Yourself shall go between ’s. The mean time, lady,
==26== I’ll raise the preparation of a war
==27== Shall stain your brother. Make your soonest haste;
==28== So your desires are yours.

**OCT.**
==28==               Thanks to my lord.
==29== The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
==30== Your reconciler! Wars ’twixt you twain would be
==31== As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
==32== Should solder up the rift.

**ANT.**
==33== When it appears to you where this begins,
==34== Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults
==35== Can never be so equal that your love
==36== Can equally move with them. Provide your going,
==37== Choose your own company, and command what cost
==38== Your heart has mind to.

*Exeunt.*
