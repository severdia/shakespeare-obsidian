## Act 4, Scene 13
[[Act 4, Scene 12|← Act 4, Scene 12]] | [[Act 4, Scene 14|Act 4, Scene 14 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, Mardian.*

**CLEO.**
Help me, my women! O, he’s more mad
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
Was never so emboss’d.

**CHAR.**
              To th’ monument!
There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.

**CLEO.**
              To th’ monument!
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
Say that the last I spoke was “Antony,”
And word it, prithee, piteously. Hence, Mardian,
And bring me how he takes my death. To th’ monument!

*Exeunt.*
