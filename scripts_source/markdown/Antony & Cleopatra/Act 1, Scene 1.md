## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Alexandria. A room in Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Demetrius and Philo.*

**PHI.**
==1==Nay, but this dotage of our general’s
==2==O’erflows the measure. Those his goodly eyes,
==3==That o’er the files and musters of the war
==4==Have glow’d like plated Mars, now bend, now turn
==5==The office and devotion of their view
==6==Upon a tawny front; his captain’s heart,
==7==Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
==8==The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
==9==And is become the bellows and the fan
==10==To cool a gypsy’s lust.
*(Flourish. Enter Antony, Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train, with eunuchs fanning her.)*
==10==              Look where they come!
==11==Take but good note, and you shall see in him
==12==The triple pillar of the world transform’d
==13==Into a strumpet’s fool. Behold and see.

**CLEO.**
==14==If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

**ANT.**
==15==There’s beggary in the love that can be reckon’d.

**CLEO.**
==16==I’ll set a bourn how far to be belov’d.

**ANT.**
==17==Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

*Enter First Roman Messenger.*

**1. ROM. MESS.**
==18==News, my good lord, from Rome.

**ANT.**
==18==                  Grates me, the sum.

**CLEO.**
==19==Nay, hear them, Antony.
==20==Fulvia perchance is angry; or who knows
==21==If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
==22==His pow’rful mandate to you: “Do this, or this;
==23==Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
==24==Perform’t, or else we damn thee.”

**ANT.**
==24==                  How, my love?

**CLEO.**
==25==Perchance? Nay, and most like.
==26==You must not stay here longer, your dismission
==27==Is come from Caesar, therefore hear it, Antony.
==28==Where’s Fulvia’s process?—Caesar’s, I would say—both?
==29==Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt’s queen,
==30==Thou blushest, Antony, and that blood of thine
==31==Is Caesar’s homager; else so thy cheek pays shame
==32==When shrill-tongu’d Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

**ANT.**
==33==Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
==34==Of the rang’d empire fall! Here is my space,
==35==Kingdoms are clay; our dungy earth alike
==36==Feeds beast as man; the nobleness of life
==37==Is to do thus
*(Embracing.)*
==37==        —when such a mutual pair
==38==And such a twain can do’t, in which I bind,
==39==On pain of punishment, the world to weet
==40==We stand up peerless.

**CLEO.**
==40==           Excellent falsehood!
==41==Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
==42==I’ll seem the fool I am not. Antony
==43==Will be himself.

**ANT.**
==43==        But stirr’d by Cleopatra.
==44==Now for the love of Love, and her soft hours,
==45==Let’s not confound the time with conference harsh;
==46==There’s not a minute of our lives should stretch
==47==Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?

**CLEO.**
==48==Hear the ambassadors.

**ANT.**
==48==           Fie, wrangling queen!
==49==Whom every thing becomes—to chide, to laugh,
==50==To weep; whose every passion fully strives
==51==To make itself (in thee) fair and admir’d!
==52==No messenger but thine, and all alone,
==53==Tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note
==54==The qualities of people. Come, my queen,
==55==Last night you did desire it.
*(To the Messenger.)*
==55==                Speak not to us.

*Exeunt Antony and Cleopatra with the Train, followed by the Messenger.*

**DEM.**
==56==Is Caesar with Antonius priz’d so slight?

**PHI.**
==57==Sir, sometimes when he is not Antony,
==58==He comes too short of that great property
==59==Which still should go with Antony.

**DEM.**
==59==                  I am full sorry
==60==That he approves the common liar, who
==61==Thus speaks of him at Rome; but I will hope
==62==Of better deeds tomorrow. Rest you happy!

*Exeunt.*
