## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Alexandria. Mark Antony’s camp.*

*Trumpets sound. Enter Antony and Eros, Scarus meeting them.*

**SCAR.**
==1==The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

**ANT.**
==2==Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail’d
==3==To make me fight at land!

**SCAR.**
==3==              Hadst thou done so,
==4==The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
==5==That has this morning left thee, would have still
==6==Followed thy heels.

**ANT.**
==6==           Who’s gone this morning?

**SCAR.**
==6==                       Who?
==7==One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,
==8==He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar’s camp
==9==Say “I am none of thine.”

**ANT.**
==9==              What sayest thou?

**SCAR.**
==9==                         Sir,
==10==He is with Caesar.

**EROS.**
==10==           Sir, his chests and treasure
==11==He has not with him.

**ANT.**
==11==           Is he gone?

**SCAR.**
==11==                  Most certain.

**ANT.**
==12==Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it,
==13==Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him
==14==(I will subscribe) gentle *adieus* and greetings;
==15==Say that I wish he never find more cause
==16==To change a master. O, my fortunes have
==17==Corrupted honest men! Dispatch. Enobarbus!

*Exeunt.*
