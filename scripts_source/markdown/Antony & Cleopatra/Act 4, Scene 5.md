## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Alexandria. Mark Antony’s camp.*

*Trumpets sound. Enter Antony and Eros, Scarus meeting them.*

**SCAR.**
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

**ANT.**
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail’d
To make me fight at land!

**SCAR.**
              Hadst thou done so,
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Followed thy heels.

**ANT.**
           Who’s gone this morning?

**SCAR.**
                       Who?
One ever near thee. Call for Enobarbus,
He shall not hear thee, or from Caesar’s camp
Say “I am none of thine.”

**ANT.**
              What sayest thou?

**SCAR.**
                         Sir,
He is with Caesar.

**EROS.**
           Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.

**ANT.**
           Is he gone?

**SCAR.**
                  Most certain.

**ANT.**
Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it,
Detain no jot, I charge thee. Write to him
(I will subscribe) gentle *adieus* and greetings;
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch. Enobarbus!

*Exeunt.*
