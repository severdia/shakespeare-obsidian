## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Messina. Pompey’s house.*

*Enter Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, in warlike manner.*

**POM.**
==1==If the great gods be just, they shall assist
==2==The deeds of justest men.

**MENAS.**
==2==              Know, worthy Pompey,
==3==That what they do delay, they not deny.

**POM.**
==4==Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
==5==The thing we sue for.

**MENE.**
==5==           We, ignorant of ourselves,
==6==Beg often our own harms, which the wise pow’rs
==7==Deny us for our good; so find we profit
==8==By losing of our prayers.

**POM.**
==8==              I shall do well:
==9==The people love me, and the sea is mine;
==10==My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
==11==Says it will come to th’ full. Mark Antony
==12==In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
==13==No wars without-doors. Caesar gets money where
==14==He loses hearts. Lepidus flatters both,
==15==Of both is flatter’d; but he neither loves,
==16==Nor either cares for him.

**MENAS.**
==16==              Caesar and Lepidus
==17==Are in the field, a mighty strength they carry.

**POM.**
==18==Where have you this? ’Tis false.

**MENAS.**
==18==                  From Silvius, sir.

**POM.**
==19==He dreams; I know they are in Rome together,
==20==Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
==21==Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wan’d lip!
==22==Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both,
==23==Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
==24==Keep his brain fuming; epicurean cooks
==25==Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,
==26==That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor,
==27==Even till a Lethe’d dullness⁠—
*(Enter Varrius.)*
==27==                How now, Varrius?

**VAR.**
==28==This is most certain that I shall deliver:
==29==Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
==30==Expected. Since he went from Egypt, ’tis
==31==A space for farther travel.

**POM.**
==31==              I could have given less matter
==32==A better ear. Menas, I did not think
==33==This amorous surfeiter would have donn’d his helm
==34==For such a petty war. His soldiership
==35==Is twice the other twain; but let us rear
==36==The higher our opinion, that our stirring
==37==Can from the lap of Egypt’s widow pluck
==38==The ne’er-lust-wearied Antony.

**MENAS.**
==38==                  I cannot hope
==39==Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
==40==His wife that’s dead did trespasses to Caesar;
==41==His brother warr’d upon him, although I think
==42==Not mov’d by Antony.

**POM.**
==42==           I know not, Menas,
==43==How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
==44==Were’t not that we stand up against them all,
==45==’Twere pregnant they should square between themselves,
==46==For they have entertained cause enough
==47==To draw their swords; but how the fear of us
==48==May cement their divisions, and bind up
==49==The petty difference, we yet not know.
==50==Be’t as our gods will have’t! It only stands
==51==Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
==52==Come, Menas.

*Exeunt.*
