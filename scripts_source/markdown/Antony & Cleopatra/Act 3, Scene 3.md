## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.*

**CLEO.**
Where is the fellow?

**ALEX.**
           Half afeard to come.

**CLEO.**
Go to, go to. Come hither, sir.

*Enter the Egyptian Messenger as before.*

**ALEX.**
                  Good Majesty!
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleas’d.

**CLEO.**
                That Herod’s head
I’ll have; but how, when Antony is gone,
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Most gracious Majesty!

**CLEO.**
           Didst thou behold Octavia?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Ay, dread Queen.

**CLEO.**
           Where?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
                Madam, in Rome;
I look’d her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.

**CLEO.**
Is she as tall as me?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
           She is not, madam.

**CLEO.**
Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu’d or low?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voic’d.

**CLEO.**
That’s not so good. He cannot like her long.

**CHAR.**
Like her? O Isis! ’Tis impossible.

**CLEO.**
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish.
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e’er thou look’st on majesty.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
                  She creeps;
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue, than a breather.

**CLEO.**
              Is this certain?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Or I have no observance.

**CHAR.**
              Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.

**CLEO.**
              He’s very knowing,
I do perceive’t. There’s nothing in her yet.
The fellow has good judgment.

**CHAR.**
                  Excellent.

**CLEO.**
Guess at her years, I prithee.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
                Madam,
She was a widow⁠—

**CLEO.**
           Widow? Charmian, hark.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
And I do think she’s thirty.

**CLEO.**
Bear’st thou her face in mind? Is’t long or round?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Round, even to faultiness.

**CLEO.**
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what color?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
Brown, madam; and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.

**CLEO.**
                There’s gold for thee,
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business. Go, make thee ready,
Our letters are prepar’d.

*Exit Egyptian Messenger.*

**CHAR.**
              A proper man.

**CLEO.**
Indeed he is so; I repent me much
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
This creature’s no such thing.

**CHAR.**
                Nothing, madam.

**CLEO.**
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

**CHAR.**
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend!
And serving you so long!

**CLEO.**
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian⁠—
But ’tis no matter, thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.

**CHAR.**
I warrant you, madam.

*Exeunt.*
