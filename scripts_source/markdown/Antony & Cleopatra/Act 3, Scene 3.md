## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Alexas.*

**CLEO.**
==1==Where is the fellow?

**ALEX.**
==1==           Half afeard to come.

**CLEO.**
==2==Go to, go to. Come hither, sir.

*Enter the Egyptian Messenger as before.*

**ALEX.**
==2==                  Good Majesty!
==3==Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
==4==But when you are well pleas’d.

**CLEO.**
==4==                That Herod’s head
==5==I’ll have; but how, when Antony is gone,
==6==Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==7==Most gracious Majesty!

**CLEO.**
==7==           Didst thou behold Octavia?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==8==Ay, dread Queen.

**CLEO.**
==8==           Where?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==8==                Madam, in Rome;
==9==I look’d her in the face, and saw her led
==10==Between her brother and Mark Antony.

**CLEO.**
==11==Is she as tall as me?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==11==           She is not, madam.

**CLEO.**
==12==Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongu’d or low?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==13==Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voic’d.

**CLEO.**
==14==That’s not so good. He cannot like her long.

**CHAR.**
==15==Like her? O Isis! ’Tis impossible.

**CLEO.**
==16==I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish.
==17==What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
==18==If e’er thou look’st on majesty.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==18==                  She creeps;
==19==Her motion and her station are as one;
==20==She shows a body rather than a life,
==21==A statue, than a breather.

**CLEO.**
==21==              Is this certain?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==22==Or I have no observance.

**CHAR.**
==22==              Three in Egypt
==23==Cannot make better note.

**CLEO.**
==23==              He’s very knowing,
==24==I do perceive’t. There’s nothing in her yet.
==25==The fellow has good judgment.

**CHAR.**
==25==                  Excellent.

**CLEO.**
==26==Guess at her years, I prithee.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==26==                Madam,
==27==She was a widow⁠—

**CLEO.**
==27==           Widow? Charmian, hark.

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==28==And I do think she’s thirty.

**CLEO.**
==29==Bear’st thou her face in mind? Is’t long or round?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==30==Round, even to faultiness.

**CLEO.**
==31==For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
==32==Her hair, what color?

**EGYPT. MESS.**
==33==Brown, madam; and her forehead
==34==As low as she would wish it.

**CLEO.**
==34==                There’s gold for thee,
==35==Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
==36==I will employ thee back again; I find thee
==37==Most fit for business. Go, make thee ready,
==38==Our letters are prepar’d.

*Exit Egyptian Messenger.*

**CHAR.**
==38==              A proper man.

**CLEO.**
==39==Indeed he is so; I repent me much
==40==That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
==41==This creature’s no such thing.

**CHAR.**
==41==                Nothing, madam.

**CLEO.**
==42==The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

**CHAR.**
==43==Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend!
==44==And serving you so long!

**CLEO.**
==45==I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian⁠—
==46==But ’tis no matter, thou shalt bring him to me
==47==Where I will write. All may be well enough.

**CHAR.**
==48==I warrant you, madam.

*Exeunt.*
