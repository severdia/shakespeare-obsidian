## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Alexandria. Before Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Antony and Cleopatra, Charmian, with others.*

**ANT.**
Eros, mine armor, Eros!

**CLEO.**
              Sleep a little.

**ANT.**
No, my chuck. Eros, come, mine armor, Eros!
*(Enter Eros with armor.)*
Come, good fellow, put thine iron on.
If Fortune be not ours today, it is
Because we brave her. Come.

**CLEO.**
                Nay, I’ll help too.
What’s this for?

**ANT.**
        Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
The armorer of my heart. False, false; this, this.

**CLEO.**
Sooth law, I’ll help. Thus it must be.

**ANT.**
                     Well, well,
We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go, put on thy defenses.

**EROS.**
              Briefly, sir.

**CLEO.**
Is not this buckled well?

**ANT.**
              Rarely, rarely:
He that unbuckles this, till we do please
To daff’t for our repose, shall hear a storm.
Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen’s a squire
More tight at this than thou; dispatch. O love,
That thou couldst see my wars today, and knew’st
The royal occupation, thou shouldst see
A workman in’t.
*(Enter an armed Scarus.)*
        Good morrow to thee, welcome.
Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge.
To business that we love we rise betime,
And go to’t with delight.

**SCAR.**
              A thousand, sir,
Early though’t be, have on their riveted trim,
And at the port expect you.

*Shout. Trumpets flourish.*

*Enter Captain of Antony’s Army, Captains and Soldiers.*

**CAPT. ANT. ARMY.**
The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.

**ALL ANT. SOLD.**
Good morrow, general.

**ANT.**
              ’Tis well blown, lads.
This morning, like the spirit of a youth
That means to be of note, begins betimes.
So, so; come give me that: this way—well said.
Fare thee well, dame, what e’er becomes of me.
This is a soldier’s kiss; rebukable
And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
On more mechanic compliment. I’ll leave thee
Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,
Follow me close, I’ll bring you to’t. *Adieu*.

*Exeunt Antony, Eros, Scarus, Captains, and Soldiers.*

**CHAR.**
Please you retire to your chamber?

**CLEO.**
                  Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight!
Then, Antony—but now—Well, on.

*Exeunt.*
