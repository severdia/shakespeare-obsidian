## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Alexandria. Before Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Antony and Cleopatra, Charmian, with others.*

**ANT.**
==1== Eros, mine armor, Eros!

**CLEO.**
==1==               Sleep a little.

**ANT.**
==2== No, my chuck. Eros, come, mine armor, Eros!
*(Enter Eros with armor.)*
==3== Come, good fellow, put thine iron on.
==4== If Fortune be not ours today, it is
==5== Because we brave her. Come.

**CLEO.**
==5==                 Nay, I’ll help too.
==6== What’s this for?

**ANT.**
==6==         Ah, let be, let be! Thou art
==7== The armorer of my heart. False, false; this, this.

**CLEO.**
==8== Sooth law, I’ll help. Thus it must be.

**ANT.**
==8==                      Well, well,
==9== We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
==10== Go, put on thy defenses.

**EROS.**
==10==               Briefly, sir.

**CLEO.**
==11== Is not this buckled well?

**ANT.**
==11==               Rarely, rarely:
==12== He that unbuckles this, till we do please
==13== To daff’t for our repose, shall hear a storm.
==14== Thou fumblest, Eros, and my queen’s a squire
==15== More tight at this than thou; dispatch. O love,
==16== That thou couldst see my wars today, and knew’st
==17== The royal occupation, thou shouldst see
==18== A workman in’t.
*(Enter an armed Scarus.)*
==18==         Good morrow to thee, welcome.
==19== Thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge.
==20== To business that we love we rise betime,
==21== And go to’t with delight.

**SCAR.**
==21==               A thousand, sir,
==22== Early though’t be, have on their riveted trim,
==23== And at the port expect you.

*Shout. Trumpets flourish.*

*Enter Captain of Antony’s Army, Captains and Soldiers.*

**CAPT. ANT. ARMY.**
==24== The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.

**ALL ANT. SOLD.**
==25== Good morrow, general.

**ANT.**
==25==               ’Tis well blown, lads.
==26== This morning, like the spirit of a youth
==27== That means to be of note, begins betimes.
==28== So, so; come give me that: this way—well said.
==29== Fare thee well, dame, what e’er becomes of me.
==30== This is a soldier’s kiss; rebukable
==31== And worthy shameful check it were, to stand
==32== On more mechanic compliment. I’ll leave thee
==33== Now like a man of steel. You that will fight,
==34== Follow me close, I’ll bring you to’t. *Adieu*.

*Exeunt Antony, Eros, Scarus, Captains, and Soldiers.*

**CHAR.**
==35== Please you retire to your chamber?

**CLEO.**
==35==                   Lead me.
==36== He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
==37== Determine this great war in single fight!
==38== Then, Antony—but now—Well, on.

*Exeunt.*
