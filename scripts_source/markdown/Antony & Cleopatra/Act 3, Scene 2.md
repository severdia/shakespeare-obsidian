## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Rome. An ante-chamber in Octavius Caesar’s house.*

*Enter Agrippa at one door, Enobarbus at another.*

**AGR.**
==1==What, are the brothers parted?

**ENO.**
==2==They have dispatch’d with Pompey, he is gone;
==3==The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
==4==To part from Rome; Caesar is sad, and Lepidus,
==5==Since Pompey’s feast, as Menas says, is troubled
==6==With the green-sickness.

**AGR.**
==6==              ’Tis a noble Lepidus.

**ENO.**
==7==A very fine one. O, how he loves Caesar!

**AGR.**
==8==Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

**ENO.**
==9==Caesar? Why, he’s the Jupiter of men.

**AGR.**
==10==What’s Antony? The god of Jupiter.

**ENO.**
==11==Spake you of Caesar? How, the nonpareil!

**AGR.**
==12==O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

**ENO.**
==13==Would you praise Caesar, say “Caesar,” go no further.

**AGR.**
==14==Indeed he plied them both with excellent praises.

**ENO.**
==15==But he loves Caesar best, yet he loves Antony.
==16==Hoo, hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards, poets, cannot
==17==Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, hoo!
==18==His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
==19==Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

**AGR.**
==19==                     Both he loves.

**ENO.**
==20==They are his shards, and he their beetle, so.
*(Trumpet within.)*
==21==This is to horse. *Adieu*, noble Agrippa.

**AGR.**
==22==Good fortune, worthy soldier, and farewell.

*Enter Caesar, Antony, Lepidus, and Octavia.*

**ANT.**
==23==No further, sir.

**CAES.**
==24==You take from me a great part of myself;
==25==Use me well in’t. Sister, prove such a wife
==26==As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
==27==Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
==28==Let not the piece of virtue which is set
==29==Betwixt us, as the cement of our love
==30==To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
==31==The fortress of it; for better might we
==32==Have lov’d without this mean, if on both parts
==33==This be not cherish’d.

**ANT.**
==33==           Make me not offended
==34==In your distrust.

**CAES.**
==34==        I have said.

**ANT.**
==34==                You shall not find,
==35==Though you be therein curious, the least cause
==36==For what you seem to fear. So the gods keep you,
==37==And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
==38==We will here part.

**CAES.**
==39==Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well,
==40==The elements be kind to thee, and make
==41==Thy spirits all of comfort! Fare thee well.

**OCT.**
==42==My noble brother!

**ANT.**
==43==The April’s in her eyes, it is love’s spring,
==44==And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.

**OCT.**
==45==Sir, look well to my husband’s house; and⁠—

**CAES.**
==45==                         What,
==46==Octavia?

**OCT.**
==46==        I’ll tell you in your ear.

**ANT.**
==47==Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
==48==Her heart inform her tongue—the swan’s down feather,
==49==That stands upon the swell at the full of tide,
==50==And neither way inclines.

**ENO.**
*(Aside to Agrippa.)*
==50==              Will Caesar weep?

**AGR.**
*(Aside to Enobarbus.)*
==51==He has a cloud in ’s face.

**ENO.**
*(Aside to Agrippa.)*
==52==He were the worse for that were he a horse;
==53==So is he being a man.

**AGR.**
*(Aside to Enobarbus.)*
==53==           Why, Enobarbus?
==54==When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
==55==He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
==56==When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

**ENO.**
*(Aside to Agrippa.)*
==57==That year indeed he was troubled with a rheum;
==58==What willingly he did confound he wail’d,
==59==Believe’t—till I weep too.

**CAES.**
==59==              No, sweet Octavia,
==60==You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
==61==Outgo my thinking on you.

**ANT.**
==61==                Come, sir, come,
==62==I’ll wrestle with you in my strength of love.
==63==Look, here I have you, thus I let you go,
==64==And give you to the gods.

**CAES.**
==64==              *Adieu*, be happy.

**LEP.**
==65==Let all the number of the stars give light
==66==To thy fair way.

**CAES.**
==66==        Farewell, farewell.

*Kisses Octavia.*

**ANT.**
==66==                     Farewell.

*Trumpets sound. Exeunt.*
