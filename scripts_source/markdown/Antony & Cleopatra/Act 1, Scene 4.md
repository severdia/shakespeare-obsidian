## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 1, Scene 5|Act 1, Scene 5 →]]

*Rome. Octavius Caesar’s house.*

*Enter Octavius Caesar reading a letter, Lepidus, and their Train.*

**CAES.**
==1== You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
==2== It is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate
==3== Our great competitor. From Alexandria
==4== This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
==5== The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike
==6== Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolomy
==7== More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
==8== Vouchsaf’d to think he had partners. You shall find there
==9== A man who is th’ abstract of all faults
==10== That all men follow.

**LEP.**
==10==            I must not think there are
==11== Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
==12== His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,
==13== More fiery by night’s blackness; hereditary,
==14== Rather than purchas’d; what he cannot change,
==15== Than what he chooses.

**CAES.**
==16== You are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not
==17== Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolomy,
==18== To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit
==19== And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,
==20== To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
==21== With knaves that smells of sweat: say this becomes him
==22== (As his composure must be rare indeed
==23== Whom these things cannot blemish), yet must Antony
==24== No way excuse his foils, when we do bear
==25== So great weight in his lightness. If he fill’d
==26== His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
==27== Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones
==28== Call on him for’t. But to confound such time
==29== That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud
==30== As his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid⁠—
==31== As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,
==32== Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
==33== And so rebel to judgment.

*Enter Caesar’s First Messenger.*

**LEP.**
==33==               Here’s more news.

**1. CAES. MESS.**
==34== Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,
==35== Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
==36== How ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,
==37== And it appears he is belov’d of those
==38== That only have fear’d Caesar; to the ports
==39== The discontents repair, and men’s reports
==40== Give him much wrong’d.

**CAES.**
==40==            I should have known no less:
==41== It hath been taught us from the primal state
==42== That he which is was wish’d, until he were;
==43== And the ebb’d man, ne’er lov’d till ne’er worth love,
==44== Comes dear’d by being lack’d. This common body,
==45== Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
==46== Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
==47== To rot itself with motion.

*Enter Caesar’s Second Messenger.*

**2. CAES. MESS.**
==47==               Caesar, I bring thee word
==48== Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
==49== Makes the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
==50== With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads
==51== They make in Italy; the borders maritime
==52== Lack blood to think on’t, and flush youth revolt.
==53== No vessel can peep forth, but ’tis as soon
==54== Taken as seen; for Pompey’s name strikes more
==55== Than could his war resisted.

**CAES.**
==55==                 Antony,
==56== Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
==57== Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st
==58== Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
==59== Did famine follow, whom thou fought’st against
==60== (Though daintily brought up) with patience more
==61== Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink
==62== The stale of horses and the gilded puddle
==63== Which beasts would cough at; thy palate then did deign
==64== The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
==65== Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
==66== The barks of trees thou brows’d. On the Alps
==67== It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
==68== Which some did die to look on; and all this
==69== (It wounds thine honor that I speak it now) 
==70== Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
==71== So much as lank’d not.

**LEP.**
==71==               ’Tis pity of him.

**CAES.**
==72== Let his shames quickly
==73== Drive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain
==74== Did show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end
==75== Assemble we immediate council. Pompey
==76== Thrives in our idleness.

**LEP.**
==76==               Tomorrow, Caesar,
==77== I shall be furnish’d to inform you rightly
==78== Both what by sea and land I can be able
==79== To front this present time.

**CAES.**
==79==               Till which encounter,
==80== It is my business too. Farewell.

**LEP.**
==81== Farewell, my lord. What you shall know mean time
==82== Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
==83== To let me be partaker.

**CAES.**
==83==               Doubt not, sir,
==84== I knew it for my bond.

*Exeunt.*
