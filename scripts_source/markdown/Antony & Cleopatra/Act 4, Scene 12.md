## Act 4, Scene 12
[[Act 4, Scene 11|← Act 4, Scene 11]] | [[Act 4, Scene 13|Act 4, Scene 13 →]]

*Another part of the field of battle between the camps.*

*Enter Antony and Scarus.*

**ANT.**
==1==Yet they are not join’d. Where yond pine does stand
==2==I shall discover all; I’ll bring thee word
==3==Straight how ’tis like to go.

*Exit.*

*Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight.*

**SCAR.**
==3==                Swallows have built
==4==In Cleopatra’s sails their nests. The auguries
==5==Say they know not, they cannot tell, look grimly,
==6==And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
==7==Is valiant, and dejected, and by starts
==8==His fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
==9==Of what he has, and has not.

*Enter Antony.*

**ANT.**
==9==                  All is lost!
==10==This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.
==11==My fleet hath yielded to the foe, and yonder
==12==They cast their caps up and carouse together
==13==Like friends long lost. Triple-turn’d whore! ’Tis thou
==14==Hast sold me to this novice, and my heart
==15==Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
==16==For when I am reveng’d upon my charm,
==17==I have done all. Bid them all fly, be gone.
*(Exit Scarus.)*
==18==O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more,
==19==Fortune and Antony part here, even here
==20==Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
==21==That spannell’d me at heels, to whom I gave
==22==Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
==23==On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark’d,
==24==That overtopp’d them all. Betray’d I am.
==25==O this false soul of Egypt! This grave charm,
==26==Whose eye beck’d forth my wars and call’d them home,
==27==Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,
==28==Like a right gypsy, hath at fast and loose
==29==Beguil’d me to the very heart of loss.
==30==What, Eros, Eros!
*(Enter Cleopatra.)*
==30==           Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!

**CLEO.**
==31==Why is my lord enrag’d against his love?

**ANT.**
==32==Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
==33==And blemish Caesar’s triumph. Let him take thee
==34==And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!
==35==Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
==36==Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
==37==For poor’st diminutives, for dolts, and let
==38==Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
==39==With her prepared nails.
*(Exit Cleopatra.)*
==39==              ’Tis well th’ art gone,
==40==If it be well to live; but better ’twere
==41==Thou fell’st into my fury, for one death
==42==Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
==43==The shirt of Nessus is upon me; teach me,
==44==Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage.
==45==Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o’ th’ moon,
==46==And with those hands, that grasp’d the heaviest club,
==47==Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die.
==48==To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
==49==Under this plot. She dies for’t. Eros, ho!

*Exit.*
