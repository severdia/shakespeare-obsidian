## Act 3, Scene 6
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 7|Act 3, Scene 7 →]]

*Rome. Octavius Caesar’s house.*

*Enter Agrippa, Maecenas, and Caesar.*

**CAES.**
==1==Contemning Rome, he has done all this and more
==2==In Alexandria. Here’s the manner of’t:
==3==I’ th’ market-place, on a tribunal silver’d,
==4==Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
==5==Were publicly enthron’d. At the feet sat
==6==Caesarion, whom they call my father’s son,
==7==And all the unlawful issue that their lust
==8==Since then hath made between them. Unto her
==9==He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her
==10==Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
==11==Absolute queen.

**MAEC.**
==11==        This in the public eye?

**CAES.**
==12==I’ th’ common show-place, where they exercise.
==13==His sons he there proclaim’d the kings of kings:
==14==Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia
==15==He gave to Alexander; to Ptolomy he assign’d
==16==Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia. She
==17==In th’ abiliments of the goddess Isis
==18==That day appear’d; and oft before gave audience,
==19==As ’tis reported, so.

**MAEC.**
==19==           Let Rome be thus
==20==Inform’d.

**AGR.**
==20==    Who, queasy with his insolence
==21==Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

**CAES.**
==22==The people knows it, and have now receiv’d
==23==His accusations.

**AGR.**
==23==           Who does he accuse?

**CAES.**
==24==Caesar, and that having in Sicily
==25==Sextus Pompeius spoil’d, we had not rated him
==26==His part o’ th’ isle. Then does he say he lent me
==27==Some shipping unrestor’d. Lastly, he frets
==28==That Lepidus of the triumpherate
==29==Should be depos’d; and being, that we detain
==30==All his revenue.

**AGR.**
==30==        Sir, this should be answer’d.

**CAES.**
==31==’Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
==32==I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel,
==33==That he his high authority abus’d,
==34==And did deserve his change. For what I have conquer’d,
==35==I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia
==36==And other of his conquer’d kingdoms, I
==37==Demand the like.

**MAEC.**
==37==           He’ll never yield to that.

**CAES.**
==38==Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

*Enter Octavia with her Train.*

**OCT.**
==39==Hail, Caesar, and my lord! Hail, most dear Caesar!

**CAES.**
==40==That ever I should call thee castaway!

**OCT.**
==41==You have not call’d me so, nor have you cause.

**CAES.**
==42==Why have you stol’n upon us thus? You come not
==43==Like Caesar’s sister. The wife of Antony
==44==Should have an army for an usher, and
==45==The neighs of horse to tell of her approach,
==46==Long ere she did appear; the trees by th’ way
==47==Should have borne men, and expectation fainted,
==48==Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
==49==Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
==50==Rais’d by your populous troops. But you are come
==51==A market-maid to Rome, and have prevented
==52==The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
==53==Is often left unlov’d. We should have met you
==54==By sea and land, supplying every stage
==55==With an augmented greeting.

**OCT.**
==55==                Good my lord,
==56==To come thus was I not constrain’d, but did it
==57==On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
==58==Hearing that you prepar’d for war, acquainted
==59==My grieved ear withal; whereon I begg’d
==60==His pardon for return.

**CAES.**
==60==              Which soon he granted,
==61==Being an abstract ’tween his lust and him.

**OCT.**
==62==Do not say so, my lord.

**CAES.**
==62==              I have eyes upon him,
==63==And his affairs come to me on the wind.
==64==Where is he now?

**OCT.**
==64==           My lord, in Athens.

**CAES.**
==65==No, my most wronged sister, Cleopatra
==66==Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
==67==Up to a whore, who now are levying
==68==The kings o’ th’ earth for war. He hath assembled
==69==Bocchus, the King of Libya; Archelaus
==70==Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, King
==71==Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
==72==King Manchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
==73==Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, King
==74==Of Comagena; Polemon and Amyntas,
==75==The Kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
==76==With a more larger list of scepters.

**OCT.**
==76==                  Ay me, most wretched,
==77==That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
==78==That does afflict each other!

**CAES.**
==78==                Welcome hither!
==79==Your letters did withhold our breaking forth,
==80==Till we perceiv’d both how you were wrong led
==81==And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart,
==82==Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
==83==O’er your content these strong necessities,
==84==But let determin’d things to destiny
==85==Hold unbewail’d their way. Welcome to Rome,
==86==Nothing more dear to me. You are abus’d
==87==Beyond the mark of thought; and the high gods,
==88==To do you justice, makes his ministers
==89==Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort,
==90==And ever welcome to us.

**AGR.**
==90==              Welcome, lady.

**MAEC.**
==91==Welcome, dear madam,
==92==Each heart in Rome does love and pity you;
==93==Only th’ adulterous Antony, most large
==94==In his abominations, turns you off,
==95==And gives his potent regiment to a trull
==96==That noises it against us.

**OCT.**
==96==              Is it so, sir?

**CAES.**
==97==Most certain. Sister, welcome. Pray you
==98==Be ever known to patience. My dear’st sister!

*Exeunt.*
