## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Rome. Octavius Caesar’s house.*

*Enter Antony, Caesar, Octavia between them.*

**ANT.**
==1==The world and my great office will sometimes
==2==Divide me from your bosom.

**OCT.**
==2==                All which time
==3==Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
==4==To them for you.

**ANT.**
==4==           Good night, sir. My Octavia,
==5==Read not my blemishes in the world’s report.
==6==I have not kept my square, but that to come
==7==Shall all be done by th’ rule. Good night, dear lady.

**OCT.**
==8==Good night, sir.

**CAES.**
==9==Good night.

*Exit with Octavia.*

*Enter Soothsayer.*

**ANT.**
==10==Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?

**SOOTH.**
==11==Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither.

**ANT.**
==12==If you can, your reason?

**SOOTH.**
==13==I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue;
==14==But yet hie you to Egypt again.

**ANT.**
==15==Say to me, whose fortunes shall rise higher,
==16==Caesar’s or mine?

**SOOTH.**
==17==Caesar’s.
==18==Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.
==19==Thy daemon, that thy spirit which keeps thee, is
==20==Noble, courageous, high unmatchable,
==21==Where Caesar’s is not; but near him, thy angel
==22==Becomes a fear, as being o’erpow’r’d: therefore
==23==Make space enough between you.

**ANT.**
==23==                  Speak this no more.

**SOOTH.**
==24==To none but thee; no more but when to thee.
==25==If thou dost play with him at any game,
==26==Thou art sure to lose; and of that natural luck,
==27==He beats thee ’gainst the odds. Thy lustre thickens
==28==When he shines by. I say again, thy spirit
==29==Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
==30==But he away, ’tis noble.

**ANT.**
==30==              Get thee gone.
==31==Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.
*(Exit Soothsayer.)*
==32==He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
==33==He hath spoken true. The very dice obey him,
==34==And in our sports my better cunning faints
==35==Under his chance. If we draw lots, he speeds;
==36==His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
==37==When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
==38==Beat mine, inhoop’d, at odds. I will to Egypt;
==39==And though I make this marriage for my peace,
==40==I’ th’ East my pleasure lies.
*(Enter Ventidius.)*
==40==                O, come, Ventidius,
==41==You must to Parthia. Your commission’s ready;
==42==Follow me, and receive’t.

*Exeunt.*
