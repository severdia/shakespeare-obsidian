## Act 3, Scene 11
[[Act 3, Scene 10|← Act 3, Scene 10]] | [[Act 3, Scene 12|Act 3, Scene 12 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Antony with Attendants.*

**ANT.**
==1==Hark, the land bids me tread no more upon’t,
==2==It is asham’d to bear me. Friends, come hither:
==3==I am so lated in the world, that I
==4==Have lost my way forever. I have a ship
==5==Laden with gold, take that, divide it; fly,
==6==And make your peace with Caesar.

**ALL ANT. ATT.**
==6==                  Fly? Not we.

**ANT.**
==7==I have fled myself, and have instructed cowards
==8==To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone,
==9==I have myself resolv’d upon a course
==10==Which has no need of you. Be gone.
==11==My treasure’s in the harbor; take it. O,
==12==I follow’d that I blush to look upon.
==13==My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
==14==Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
==15==For fear and doting. Friends, be gone, you shall
==16==Have letters from me to some friends that will
==17==Sweep your way for you. Pray you look not sad,
==18==Nor make replies of loathness; take the hint
==19==Which my despair proclaims: let that be left
==20==Which leaves itself. To the sea-side straightway;
==21==I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
==22==Leave me, I pray, a little; pray you now,
==23==Nay, do so; for indeed I have lost command,
==24==Therefore I pray you. I’ll see you by and by.

*Sits down.*

*Enter Cleopatra led by Charmian and Eros, Iras following.*

**EROS.**
==25==Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.

**IRAS.**
==26==Do, most dear Queen.

**CHAR.**
==27==Do? Why, what else?

**CLEO.**
==28==Let me sit down. O Juno!

**ANT.**
==29==No, no, no, no, no.

**EROS.**
==30==See you here, sir?

**ANT.**
==31==O fie, fie, fie!

**CHAR.**
==32==Madam!

**IRAS.**
==33==Madam, O good Empress!

**EROS.**
==34==Sir, sir!

**ANT.**
==35==Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
==36==His sword e’en like a dancer, while I struck
==37==The lean and wrinkled Cassius, and ’twas I
==38==That the mad Brutus ended. He alone
==39==Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practice had
==40==In the brave squares of war; yet now—No matter.

**CLEO.**
==41==Ah, stand by.

**EROS.**
==42==The Queen, my lord, the Queen.

**IRAS.**
==43==Go to him, madam, speak to him,
==44==He’s unqualited with very shame.

**CLEO.**
==45==Well then, sustain me. O!

**EROS.**
==46==Most noble sir, arise, the Queen approaches.
==47==Her head’s declin’d, and death will seize her, but
==48==Your comfort makes the rescue.

**ANT.**
==49==I have offended reputation,
==50==A most unnoble swerving.

**EROS.**
==50==              Sir, the Queen.

**ANT.**
==51==O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See
==52==How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
==53==By looking back what I have left behind
==54==’Stroy’d in dishonor.

**CLEO.**
==54==           O my lord, my lord,
==55==Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
==56==You would have followed.

**ANT.**
==56==              Egypt, thou knew’st too well
==57==My heart was to thy rudder tied by th’ strings,
==58==And thou shouldst tow me after. O’er my spirit
==59==Thy full supremacy thou knew’st, and that
==60==Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
==61==Command me.

**CLEO.**
==61==        O, my pardon!

**ANT.**
==61==                  Now I must
==62==To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
==63==And palter in the shifts of lowness, who
==64==With half the bulk o’ th’ world play’d as I pleas’d,
==65==Making and marring fortunes. You did know
==66==How much you were my conqueror, and that
==67==My sword, made weak by my affection, would
==68==Obey it on all cause.

**CLEO.**
==68==           Pardon, pardon!

**ANT.**
==69==Fall not a tear, I say, one of them rates
==70==All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss.
==71==Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster,
==72==Is ’a come back? Love, I am full of lead.
==73==Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
==74==We scorn her most when most she offers blows.

*Exeunt.*
