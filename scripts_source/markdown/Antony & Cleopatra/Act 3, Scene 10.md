## Act 3, Scene 10
[[Act 3, Scene 9|← Act 3, Scene 9]] | [[Act 3, Scene 11|Act 3, Scene 11 →]]

*Another part of the plain near Actium.*

*Canidius marcheth with his land army one way over the stage, and Taurus, the lieutenant of Caesar, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight.*

*Alarum. Enter Enobarbus.*

**ENO.**
==1== Naught, naught, all naught! I can behold no longer.
==2== Th’ Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
==3== With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder.
==4== To see’t mine eyes are blasted.

*Enter Scarus.*

**SCAR.**
==4==                 Gods and goddesses,
==5== All the whole synod of them!

**ENO.**
==5==                 What’s thy passion?

**SCAR.**
==6== The greater cantle of the world is lost
==7== With very ignorance, we have kiss’d away
==8== Kingdoms and provinces.

**ENO.**
==8==               How appears the fight?

**SCAR.**
==9== On our side like the token’d pestilence,
==10== Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt
==11== (Whom leprosy o’ertake!) i’ th’ midst o’ th’ fight,
==12== When vantage like a pair of twins appear’d,
==13== Both as the same, or rather ours the elder⁠—
==14== The breeze upon her, like a cow in June⁠—
==15== Hoists sails and flies.

**ENO.**
==15==               That I beheld.
==16== Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not
==17== Endure a further view.

**SCAR.**
==17==               She once being loof’d,
==18== The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
==19== Claps on his sea-wing, and (like a doting mallard),
==20== Leaving the fight in height, flies after her.
==21== I never saw an action of such shame;
==22== Experience, manhood, honor, ne’er before
==23== Did violate so itself.

**ENO.**
==23==            Alack, alack!

*Enter Canidius.*

**CAN.**
==24== Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
==25== And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
==26== Been what he knew himself, it had gone well.
==27== O, he has given example for our flight,
==28== Most grossly, by his own!

**ENO.**
==28==               Ay, are you thereabouts?
==29== Why then good night indeed.

**CAN.**
==30== Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

**SCAR.**
==31== ’Tis easy to’t, and there I will attend
==32== What further comes.

**CAN.**
==32==            To Caesar will I render
==33== My legions and my horse: six kings already
==34== Show me the way of yielding.

**ENO.**
==34==                   I’ll yet follow
==35== The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
==36== Sits in the wind against me.

*Exeunt severally.*
