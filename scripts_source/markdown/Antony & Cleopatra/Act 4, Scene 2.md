## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Antony, Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas, with others.*

**ANT.**
==1== He will not fight with me, Domitius?

**ENO.**
==1==                      No.

**ANT.**
==2== Why should he not?

**ENO.**
==3== He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
==4== He is twenty men to one.

**ANT.**
==4==               Tomorrow, soldier,
==5== By sea and land I’ll fight; or I will live,
==6== Or bathe my dying honor in the blood
==7== Shall make it live again. Woo’t thou fight well?

**ENO.**
==8== I’ll strike, and cry, “Take all!”

**ANT.**
==8==                 Well said, come on.
==9== Call forth my household servants, let’s tonight
==10== Be bounteous at our meal.
*(Enter three or four Attendants.)*
==10==               Give me thy hand,
==11== Thou hast been rightly honest—so hast thou⁠—
==12== Thou—and thou—and thou. You have serv’d me well,
==13== And kings have been your fellows.

**CLEO.**
*(Aside to Enobarbus.)*
==13==                   What means this?

**ENO.**
*(Aside to Cleopatra.)*
==14== ’Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots
==15== Out of the mind.

**ANT.**
==15==            And thou art honest too.
==16== I wish I could be made so many men,
==17== And all of you clapp’d up together in
==18== An Antony, that I might do you service
==19== So good as you have done.

**ALL ANT. ATT.**
==19==               The gods forbid!

**ANT.**
==20== Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
==21== Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
==22== As when mine empire was your fellow too,
==23== And suffer’d my command.

**CLEO.**
*(Aside to Enobarbus.)*
==23==               What does he mean?

**ENO.**
*(Aside to Cleopatra.)*
==24== To make his followers weep.

**ANT.**
==24==                 Tend me tonight;
==25== May be it is the period of your duty;
==26== Haply you shall not see me more, or if,
==27== A mangled shadow. Perchance tomorrow
==28== You’ll serve another master. I look on you
==29== As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
==30== I turn you not away, but like a master
==31== Married to your good service, stay till death.
==32== Tend me tonight two hours, I ask no more,
==33== And the gods yield you for’t!

**ENO.**
==33==                 What mean you, sir,
==34== To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep,
==35== And I, an ass, am onion-ey’d. For shame,
==36== Transform us not to women.

**ANT.**
==36==                 Ho, ho, ho!
==37== Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
==38== Grace grow where those drops fall, my hearty friends!
==39== You take me in too dolorous a sense,
==40== For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
==41== To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
==42== I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you
==43== Where rather I’ll expect victorious life
==44== Than death and honor. Let’s to supper, come,
==45== And drown consideration.

*Exeunt.*
