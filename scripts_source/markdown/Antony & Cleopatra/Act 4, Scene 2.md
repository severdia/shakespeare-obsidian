## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Antony, Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas, with others.*

**ANT.**
He will not fight with me, Domitius?

**ENO.**
                     No.

**ANT.**
Why should he not?

**ENO.**
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
He is twenty men to one.

**ANT.**
              Tomorrow, soldier,
By sea and land I’ll fight; or I will live,
Or bathe my dying honor in the blood
Shall make it live again. Woo’t thou fight well?

**ENO.**
I’ll strike, and cry, “Take all!”

**ANT.**
                Well said, come on.
Call forth my household servants, let’s tonight
Be bounteous at our meal.
*(Enter three or four Attendants.)*
              Give me thy hand,
Thou hast been rightly honest—so hast thou⁠—
Thou—and thou—and thou. You have serv’d me well,
And kings have been your fellows.

**CLEO.**
*(Aside to Enobarbus.)*
                  What means this?

**ENO.**
*(Aside to Cleopatra.)*
’Tis one of those odd tricks which sorrow shoots
Out of the mind.

**ANT.**
           And thou art honest too.
I wish I could be made so many men,
And all of you clapp’d up together in
An Antony, that I might do you service
So good as you have done.

**ALL ANT. ATT.**
              The gods forbid!

**ANT.**
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.
Scant not my cups, and make as much of me
As when mine empire was your fellow too,
And suffer’d my command.

**CLEO.**
*(Aside to Enobarbus.)*
              What does he mean?

**ENO.**
*(Aside to Cleopatra.)*
To make his followers weep.

**ANT.**
                Tend me tonight;
May be it is the period of your duty;
Haply you shall not see me more, or if,
A mangled shadow. Perchance tomorrow
You’ll serve another master. I look on you
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
I turn you not away, but like a master
Married to your good service, stay till death.
Tend me tonight two hours, I ask no more,
And the gods yield you for’t!

**ENO.**
                What mean you, sir,
To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep,
And I, an ass, am onion-ey’d. For shame,
Transform us not to women.

**ANT.**
                Ho, ho, ho!
Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall, my hearty friends!
You take me in too dolorous a sense,
For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you
To burn this night with torches. Know, my hearts,
I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you
Where rather I’ll expect victorious life
Than death and honor. Let’s to supper, come,
And drown consideration.

*Exeunt.*
