## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Alexandria. Another room in Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Enobarbus, Lamprius the Soothsayer, Rannius, Lucillius, Charmian, Iras, Mardian the Eunuch, and Alexas.*

**CHAR.**
==1== Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas, almost most absolute Alexas, where’s the soothsayer that you prais’d so to th’ Queen? O that I knew this husband, which, you say, must change his horns with garlands!

**ALEX.**
==2== Soothsayer!

**SOOTH.**
==3== Your will?

**CHAR.**
==4== Is this the man? Is’t you, sir, that know things?

**SOOTH.**
==5== In nature’s infinite book of secrecy
==6== A little I can read.

**ALEX.**
==6==            Show him your hand.

**ENO.**
*(To Servants within.)*
==7== Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough,
==8== Cleopatra’s health to drink.

**CHAR.**
==9== Good sir, give me good fortune.

**SOOTH.**
==10== I make not, but foresee.

**CHAR.**
==11== Pray then, foresee me one.

**SOOTH.**
==12== You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

**CHAR.**
==13== He means in flesh.

**IRAS.**
==14== No, you shall paint when you are old.

**CHAR.**
==15== Wrinkles forbid!

**ALEX.**
==16== Vex not his prescience, be attentive.

**CHAR.**
==17== Hush!

**SOOTH.**
==18== You shall be more beloving than beloved.

**CHAR.**
==19== I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

**ALEX.**
==20== Nay, hear him.

**CHAR.**
==21== Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

**SOOTH.**
==22== You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

**CHAR.**
==23== O, excellent, I love long life better than figs.

**SOOTH.**
==24== You have seen and prov’d a fairer former fortune
==25== Than that which is to approach.

**CHAR.**
==26== Then belike my children shall have no names. Prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

**SOOTH.**
==27== If every of your wishes had a womb,
==28== And fertile every wish, a million.

**CHAR.**
==29== Out, fool, I forgive thee for a witch.

**ALEX.**
==30== You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.

**CHAR.**
==31== Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

**ALEX.**
==32== We’ll know all our fortunes.

**ENO.**
==33== Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be—drunk to bed.

**IRAS.**
==34== There’s a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

**CHAR.**
==35== E’en as the o’erflowing Nilus presageth famine.

**IRAS.**
==36== Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.

**CHAR.**
==37== Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee tell her but a worky-day fortune.

**SOOTH.**
==38== Your fortunes are alike.

**IRAS.**
==39== But how, but how? Give me particulars.

**SOOTH.**
==40== I have said.

**IRAS.**
==41== Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?

**CHAR.**
==42== Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?

**IRAS.**
==43== Not in my husband’s nose.

**CHAR.**
==44== Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas—come, his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!

**IRAS.**
==45== Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a heart-breaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv’d, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded; therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

**CHAR.**
==46== Amen.

**ALEX.**
==47== Lo now, if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold, they would make themselves whores but they’ld do’t!

*Enter Cleopatra.*

**ENO.**
==48== Hush, here comes Antony.

**CHAR.**
==48==               Not he, the Queen.

**CLEO.**
==49== Saw you my lord?

**ENO.**
==49==            No, lady.

**CLEO.**
==49==                 Was he not here?

**CHAR.**
==50== No, madam.

**CLEO.**
==51== He was dispos’d to mirth, but on the sudden
==52== A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

**ENO.**
==53== Madam?

**CLEO.**
==54== Seek him, and bring him hither. Where’s Alexas?

**ALEX.**
==55== Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

*Enter Antony with First Messenger and Attendants.*

**CLEO.**
==56== We will not look upon him. Go with us.

*Exeunt Cleopatra, Enobarbus, and Train.*

**1. MESS.**
==57== Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

**ANT.**
==58== Against my brother Lucius?

**1. MESS.**
==59== Ay;
==60== But soon that war had end, and the time’s state
==61== Made friends of them, jointing their force ’gainst Caesar,
==62== Whose better issue in the war from Italy,
==63== Upon the first encounter, drave them.

**ANT.**
==63==                      Well, what worst?

**1. MESS.**
==64== The nature of bad news infects the teller.

**ANT.**
==65== When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
==66== Things that are past are done with me. ’Tis thus:
==67== Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
==68== I hear him as he flatter’d.

**1. MESS.**
==68==               Labienus
==69== (This is stiff news) hath with his Parthian force
==70== Extended Asia; from Euphrates
==71== His conquering banner shook, from Syria
==72== To Lydia and to Ionia,
==73== Whilst⁠—

**ANT.**
==73==     Antony, thou wouldst say⁠—

**1. MESS.**
==73==                   O, my lord!

**ANT.**
==74== Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue;
==75== Name Cleopatra as she is call’d in Rome.
==76== Rail thou in Fulvia’s phrase, and taunt my faults
==77== With such full license as both truth and malice
==78== Have power to utter. O then we bring forth weeds
==79== When our quick winds lie still, and our ills told us
==80== Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

**1. MESS.**
==81== At your noble pleasure.

*Exit First Messenger.*

**ANT.**
==82== From Sicyon how the news? Speak there!

**ANT. 1. ATT.**
==83== The man from Sicyon—is there such an one?

**ANT. 2. ATT.**
==84== He stays upon your will.

**ANT.**
==84==               Let him appear.
==85== These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
==86== Or lose myself in dotage.
*(Enter Second Messenger with a letter.)*
==86==               What are you?

**2. MESS.**
==87== Fulvia thy wife is dead.

**ANT.**
==87==               Where died she?

**2. MESS.**
==88== In Sicyon:
==89== Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
==90== Importeth thee to know, this bears.

*Gives a letter.*

**ANT.**
==90==                   Forbear me.
*(Exit Second Messenger.)*
==91== There’s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it.
==92== What our contempts doth often hurl from us,
==93== We wish it ours again. The present pleasure,
==94== By revolution low’ring, does become
==95== The opposite of itself. She’s good, being gone;
==96== The hand could pluck her back that shov’d her on.
==97== I must from this enchanting queen break off;
==98== Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
==99== My idleness doth hatch. How now, Enobarbus?

*Enter Enobarbus.*

**ENO.**
==100== What’s your pleasure, sir?

**ANT.**
==101== I must with haste from hence.

**ENO.**
==102== Why then we kill all our women. We see how mortal an unkindness is to them; if they suffer our departure, death’s the word.

**ANT.**
==103== I must be gone.

**ENO.**
==104== Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause, they should be esteem’d nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.

**ANT.**
==105== She is cunning past man’s thought.

**ENO.**
==106== Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a show’r of rain as well as Jove.

**ANT.**
==107== Would I had never seen her!

**ENO.**
==108== O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.

**ANT.**
==109== Fulvia is dead.

**ENO.**
==110== Sir?

**ANT.**
==111== Fulvia is dead.

**ENO.**
==112== Fulvia?

**ANT.**
==113== Dead.

**ENO.**
==114== Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown’d with consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.

**ANT.**
==115== The business she hath broached in the state
==116== Cannot endure my absence.

**ENO.**
==117== And the business you have broach’d here cannot be without you, especially that of Cleopatra’s, which wholly depends on your abode.

**ANT.**
==118== No more light answers. Let our officers
==119== Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
==120== The cause of our expedience to the Queen,
==121== And get her leave to part. For not alone
==122== The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
==123== Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
==124== Of many our contriving friends in Rome
==125== Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius
==126== Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
==127== The empire of the sea. Our slippery people,
==128== Whose love is never link’d to the deserver
==129== Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
==130== Pompey the Great and all his dignities
==131== Upon his son, who, high in name and power,
==132== Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
==133== For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,
==134== The sides o’ th’ world may danger. Much is breeding,
==135== Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life,
==136== And not a serpent’s poison. Say our pleasure,
==137== To such whose places under us require,
==138== Our quick remove from hence.

**ENO.**
==139== I shall do’t.

*Exeunt.*
