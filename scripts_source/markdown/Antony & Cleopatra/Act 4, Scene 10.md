[[Act 4, Scene 9|← Act 4, Scene 9]] | [[Act 4, Scene 11|Act 4, Scene 11 →]]

*The field of battle between the camps.*

*Enter Antony and Scarus with their army.*

**ANT.**
==1==Their preparation is today by sea,
==2==We please them not by land.

**SCAR.**
==2==                For both, my lord.

**ANT.**
==3==I would they’ld fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air;
==4==We’ld fight there too. But this it is: our foot
==5==Upon the hills adjoining to the city
==6==Shall stay with us—order for sea is given,
==7==They have put forth the haven⁠—
==8==Where their appointment we may best discover,
==9==And look on their endeavor.

*Exeunt.*
