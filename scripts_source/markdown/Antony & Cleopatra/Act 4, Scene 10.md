## Act 4, Scene 10
[[Act 4, Scene 9|← Act 4, Scene 9]] | [[Act 4, Scene 11|Act 4, Scene 11 →]]

*The field of battle between the camps.*

*Enter Antony and Scarus with their army.*

**ANT.**
Their preparation is today by sea,
We please them not by land.

**SCAR.**
                For both, my lord.

**ANT.**
I would they’ld fight i’ th’ fire or i’ th’ air;
We’ld fight there too. But this it is: our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us—order for sea is given,
They have put forth the haven⁠—
Where their appointment we may best discover,
And look on their endeavor.

*Exeunt.*
