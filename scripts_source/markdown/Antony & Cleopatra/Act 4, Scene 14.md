## Act 4, Scene 14
[[Act 4, Scene 13|← Act 4, Scene 13]] | [[Act 4, Scene 15|Act 4, Scene 15 →]]

*Alexandria. Another room in Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Antony and Eros.*

**ANT.**
==1==Eros, thou yet behold’st me?

**EROS.**
==1==                Ay, noble lord.

**ANT.**
==2==Sometime we see a cloud that’s dragonish,
==3==A vapor sometime like a bear or lion,
==4==A tower’d citadel, a pendant rock,
==5==A forked mountain, or blue promontory
==6==With trees upon’t that nod unto the world,
==7==And mock our eyes with air. Thou hast seen these signs,
==8==They are black vesper’s pageants.

**EROS.**
==8==                  Ay, my lord.

**ANT.**
==9==That which is now a horse, even with a thought
==10==The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct
==11==As water is in water.

**EROS.**
==11==           It does, my lord.

**ANT.**
==12==My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
==13==Even such a body. Here I am Antony,
==14==Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
==15==I made these wars for Egypt, and the Queen,
==16==Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine⁠—
==17==Which whilst it was mine had annex’d unto’t
==18==A million more (now lost)—she, Eros, has
==19==Pack’d cards with Caesar’s, and false-play’d my glory
==20==Unto an enemy’s triumph.
==21==Nay, weep not, gentle Eros, there is left us
==22==Ourselves to end ourselves.
*(Enter Mardian.)*
==22==                O, thy vild lady!
==23==She has robb’d me of my sword.

**MAR.**
==23==                  No, Antony,
==24==My mistress lov’d thee, and her fortunes mingled
==25==With thine entirely.

**ANT.**
==25==           Hence, saucy eunuch, peace!
==26==She hath betray’d me, and shall die the death.

**MAR.**
==27==Death of one person can be paid but once,
==28==And that she has discharg’d. What thou wouldst do
==29==Is done unto thy hand; the last she spake
==30==Was “Antony, most noble Antony!”
==31==Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
==32==The name of Antony; it was divided
==33==Between her heart and lips. She rend’red life,
==34==Thy name so buried in her.

**ANT.**
==34==              Dead then?

**MAR.**
==34==                     Dead.

**ANT.**
==35==Unarm, Eros, the long day’s task is done,
==36==And we must sleep.
*(To Mardian.)*
==36==           That thou depart’st hence safe
==37==Does pay thy labor richly; go.
*(Exit Mardian.)*
==37==                  Off, pluck off,
==38==The sevenfold shield of Ajax cannot keep
==39==The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
==40==Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
==41==Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
==42==No more a soldier. Bruised pieces, go,
==43==You have been nobly borne.—From me awhile.
*(Exit Eros.)*
==44==I will o’ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
==45==Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
==46==All length is torture; since the torch is out,
==47==Lie down and stray no farther. Now all labor
==48==Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
==49==Itself with strength. Seal then, and all is done.
==50==Eros!—I come, my queen!—Eros!—Stay for me!
==51==Where souls do couch on flowers, we’ll hand in hand,
==52==And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.
==53==Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,
==54==And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!

*Enter Eros.*

**EROS.**
==55==What would my lord?

**ANT.**
==55==              Since Cleopatra died
==56==I have liv’d in such dishonor that the gods
==57==Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
==58==Quarter’d the world, and o’er green Neptune’s back
==59==With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
==60==The courage of a woman—less noble mind
==61==Than she which by her death our Caesar tells,
==62==“I am conqueror of myself.” Thou art sworn, Eros,
==63==That when the exigent should come, which now
==64==Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
==65==Th’ inevitable prosecution of
==66==Disgrace and horror, that on my command
==67==Thou then wouldst kill me. Do’t, the time is come.
==68==Thou strik’st not me, ’tis Caesar thou defeat’st.
==69==Put color in thy cheek.

**EROS.**
==69==              The gods withhold me!
==70==Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
==71==Though enemy, lost aim and could not?

**ANT.**
==71==                       Eros,
==72==Wouldst thou be window’d in great Rome, and see
==73==Thy master thus with pleach’d arms, bending down
==74==His corrigible neck, his face subdu’d
==75==To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel’d seat
==76==Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
==77==His baseness that ensued?

**EROS.**
==77==              I would not see’t.

**ANT.**
==78==Come then; for with a wound I must be cur’d.
==79==Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
==80==Most useful for thy country.

**EROS.**
==80==                O, sir, pardon me!

**ANT.**
==81==When I did make thee free, swor’st thou not then
==82==To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once,
==83==Or thy precedent services are all
==84==But accidents unpurpos’d. Draw, and come.

**EROS.**
==85==Turn from me then that noble countenance,
==86==Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

**ANT.**
==87==Lo thee!

*Turning from him.*

**EROS.**
==88==My sword is drawn.

**ANT.**
==88==           Then let it do at once
==89==The thing why thou hast drawn it.

**EROS.**
==89==                  My dear master,
==90==My captain, and my emperor: let me say,
==91==Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

**ANT.**
==92==’Tis said, man, and farewell.

**EROS.**
==93==Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?

**ANT.**
==93==                     Now, Eros.

**EROS.**
==94==Why, there then.
*(Kills himself.)*
==94==           Thus I do escape the sorrow
==95==Of Antony’s death.

**ANT.**
==95==           Thrice-nobler than myself!
==96==Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
==97==I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
==98==Have by their brave instruction got upon me
==99==A nobleness in record; but I will be
==100==A bridegroom in my death, and run into’t
==101==As to a lover’s bed. Come then; and, Eros,
==102==Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus
*(Falling on his sword.)*
==103==I learnt of thee. How, not dead? Not dead?
==104==The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!

*Enter Decretas and Antony’s First Guardsman.*

**ANT. 1. GUARD.**
==104==                  What’s the noise?

**ANT.**
==105==I have done my work ill, friends. O, make an end
==106==Of what I have begun.

**ANT. 2. GUARD.**
==106==              The star is fall’n.

**ANT. 1. GUARD.**
==107==And time is at his period.

**ALL GUARDS.**
==107==              Alas, and woe!

**ANT.**
==108==Let him that loves me strike me dead.

**ANT. 1. GUARD.**
==108==                     Not I.

**ANT. 2. GUARD.**
==109==Nor I.

**ANT. 3. GUARD.**
==110==Nor any one.

*Exeunt Antony’s Third Guardsman.*

**DEC.**
==111==Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
==112==This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
==113==Shall enter me with him.

*Enter Diomedes.*

**DIO.**
==114==Where’s Antony?

**DEC.**
==114==           There, Diomed, there.

**DIO.**
==114==                         Lives he?
==115==Wilt thou not answer, man?

*Exit Decretas.*

**ANT.**
==116==Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
==117==Sufficing strokes for death.

**DIO.**
==117==                Most absolute lord,
==118==My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.

**ANT.**
==119==When did she send thee?

**DIO.**
==119==              Now, my lord.

**ANT.**
==119==                       Where is she?

**DIO.**
==120==Lock’d in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
==121==Of what hath come to pass; for when she saw
==122==(Which never shall be found) you did suspect
==123==She had dispos’d with Caesar, and that your rage
==124==Would not be purg’d, she sent you word she was dead;
==125==But fearing since how it might work, hath sent
==126==Me to proclaim the truth, and I am come,
==127==I dread, too late.

**ANT.**
==128==Too late, good Diomed. Call my guard, I prithee.

**DIO.**
==129==What ho! The Emperor’s guard! The guard, what ho!
==130==Come, your lord calls!

*Enter four or five of the Guard of Antony.*

**ANT.**
==131==Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides,
==132==’Tis the last service that I shall command you.

**ANT. 1. GUARD.**
==133==Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
==134==All your true followers out.

**ALL GUARDS.**
==134==                Most heavy day!

**ANT.**
==135==Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
==136==To grace it with your sorrows. Bid that welcome
==137==Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
==138==Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up.
==139==I have led you oft, carry me now, good friends,
==140==And have my thanks for all.

*Exeunt bearing Antony.*
