## Act 4, Scene 7
[[Act 4, Scene 6|← Act 4, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 8|Act 4, Scene 8 →]]

*Field of battle between the camps.*

*Alarum. Drums and Trumpets. Enter Agrippa and others.*

**AGR.**
==1== Retire, we have engag’d ourselves too far.
==2== Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
==3== Exceeds what we expected.

*Exeunt.*

*Alarums. Enter Antony, and Scarus wounded.*

**SCAR.**
==4== O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
==5== Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
==6== With clouts about their heads.

**ANT.**
==6==                 Thou bleed’st apace.

**SCAR.**
==7== I had a wound here that was like a T,
==8== But now ’tis made an H.

*Sound retreat far off.*

**ANT.**
==8==               They do retire.

**SCAR.**
==9== We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes. I have yet
==10== Room for six scotches more.

*Enter Eros.*

**EROS.**
==11== They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
==12== For a fair victory.

**SCAR.**
==12==            Let us score their backs,
==13== And snatch ’em up, as we take hares, behind:
==14== ’Tis sport to maul a runner.

**ANT.**
==14==                 I will reward thee
==15== Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
==16== For thy good valor. Come thee on.

**SCAR.**
==16==                   I’ll halt after.

*Exeunt.*
