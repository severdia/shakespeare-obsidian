## Act 4, Scene 7
[[Act 4, Scene 6|← Act 4, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 8|Act 4, Scene 8 →]]

*Field of battle between the camps.*

*Alarum. Drums and Trumpets. Enter Agrippa and others.*

**AGR.**
Retire, we have engag’d ourselves too far.
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.

*Exeunt.*

*Alarums. Enter Antony, and Scarus wounded.*

**SCAR.**
O my brave Emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
With clouts about their heads.

**ANT.**
                Thou bleed’st apace.

**SCAR.**
I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now ’tis made an H.

*Sound retreat far off.*

**ANT.**
              They do retire.

**SCAR.**
We’ll beat ’em into bench-holes. I have yet
Room for six scotches more.

*Enter Eros.*

**EROS.**
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.

**SCAR.**
           Let us score their backs,
And snatch ’em up, as we take hares, behind:
’Tis sport to maul a runner.

**ANT.**
                I will reward thee
Once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
For thy good valor. Come thee on.

**SCAR.**
                  I’ll halt after.

*Exeunt.*
