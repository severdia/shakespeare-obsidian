## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 15|← Act 4, Scene 15]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Alexandria. Octavius Caesar’s camp.*

*Enter Caesar with his council of war: Agrippa, Dolabella, Maecenas, Gallus, Proculeius.*

**CAES.**
==1==Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
==2==Being so frustrate, tell him, he mocks
==3==The pauses that he makes.

**DOL.**
==3==              Caesar, I shall.

*Exit.*

*Enter Decretas with the sword of Antony.*

**CAES.**
==4==Wherefore is that? And what art thou that dar’st
==5==Appear thus to us?

**DEC.**
==5==           I am call’d Decretas;
==6==Mark Antony I serv’d, who best was worthy
==7==Best to be serv’d. Whilst he stood up and spoke,
==8==He was my master, and I wore my life
==9==To spend upon his haters. If thou please
==10==To take me to thee, as I was to him
==11==I’ll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
==12==I yield thee up my life.

**CAES.**
==12==              What is’t thou say’st?

**DEC.**
==13==I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

**CAES.**
==14==The breaking of so great a thing should make
==15==A greater crack. The round world
==16==Should have shook lions into civil streets,
==17==And citizens to their dens. The death of Antony
==18==Is not a single doom, in the name lay
==19==A moi’ty of the world.

**DEC.**
==19==              He is dead, Caesar,
==20==Not by a public minister of justice,
==21==Nor by a hired knife, but that self hand
==22==Which writ his honor in the acts it did
==23==Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
==24==Splitted the heart. This is his sword,
==25==I robb’d his wound of it; behold it stain’d
==26==With his most noble blood.

**CAES.**
==26==              Look you sad, friends?
==27==The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
==28==To wash the eyes of kings.

**AGR.**
==28==              And strange it is
==29==That nature must compel us to lament
==30==Our most persisted deeds.

**MAEC.**
==30==              His taints and honors
==31==Wag’d equal with him.

**AGR.**
==31==              A rarer spirit never
==32==Did steer humanity; but you gods will give us
==33==Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch’d.

**MAEC.**
==34==When such a spacious mirror’s set before him,
==35==He needs must see himself.

**CAES.**
==35==              O Antony,
==36==I have followed thee to this; but we do launch
==37==Diseases in our bodies. I must perforce
==38==Have shown to thee such a declining day,
==39==Or look on thine; we could not stall together
==40==In the whole world. But yet let me lament,
==41==With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
==42==That thou, my brother, my competitor
==43==In top of all design, my mate in empire,
==44==Friend and companion in the front of war,
==45==The arm of mine own body, and the heart
==46==Where mine his thoughts did kindle—that our stars,
==47==Unreconciliable, should divide
==48==Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends⁠—
*(Enter Second Egyptian Servant.)*
==49==But I will tell you at some meeter season,
==50==The business of this man looks out of him;
==51==We’ll hear him what he says.—Whence are you?

**2. EGYPT. SERV.**
==52==A poor Egyptian yet; the Queen my mistress,
==53==Confin’d in all she has, her monument,
==54==Of thy intents desires instruction,
==55==That she preparedly may frame herself
==56==To th’ way she’s forc’d to.

**CAES.**
==56==              Bid her have good heart.
==57==She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
==58==How honorable and how kindly we
==59==Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
==60==To be ungentle.

**2. EGYPT. SERV.**
==60==        So the gods preserve thee!

*Exit.*

**CAES.**
==61==Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say
==62==We purpose her no shame. Give her what comforts
==63==The quality of her passion shall require,
==64==Lest in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
==65==She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
==66==Would be eternal in our triumph. Go,
==67==And with your speediest bring us what she says,
==68==And how you find of her.

**PROC.**
==68==              Caesar, I shall.

*Exit Proculeius.*

**CAES.**
==69==Gallus, go you along.
*(Exit Gallus.)*
==69==              Where’s Dolabella,
==70==To second Proculeius?

**AGR., MAEC., DEC.**
==70==              Dolabella!

**CAES.**
==71==Let him alone; for I remember now
==72==How he’s employ’d; he shall in time be ready.
==73==Go with me to my tent, where you shall see
==74==How hardly I was drawn into this war,
==75==How calm and gentle I proceeded still
==76==In all my writings. Go with me, and see
==77==What I can show in this.

*Exeunt.*
