## Act 2, Scene 6
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 7|Act 2, Scene 7 →]]

*Near Misenum.*

*Flourish. Enter Pompey, Menas at one door, with Drum and Trumpet: at another, Caesar, Lepidus, Antony, Enobarbus, Maecenas, Agrippa, with Soldiers marching.*

**POM.**
==1==Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
==2==And we shall talk before we fight.

**CAES.**
==2==                  Most meet
==3==That first we come to words, and therefore have we
==4==Our written purposes before us sent,
==5==Which if thou hast considered, let us know
==6==If ’twill tie up thy discontented sword,
==7==And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
==8==That else must perish here.

**POM.**
==8==              To you all three,
==9==The senators alone of this great world,
==10==Chief factors for the gods: I do not know
==11==Wherefore my father should revengers want,
==12==Having a son and friends, since Julius Caesar,
==13==Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
==14==There saw you laboring for him. What was’t
==15==That mov’d pale Cassius to conspire? And what
==16==Made all-honor’d, honest, Roman Brutus,
==17==With the arm’d rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,
==18==To drench the Capitol, but that they would
==19==Have one man but a man? And that is it
==20==Hath made me rig my navy, at whose burden
==21==The anger’d ocean foams, with which I meant
==22==To scourge th’ ingratitude that despiteful Rome
==23==Cast on my noble father.

**CAES.**
==23==              Take your time.

**ANT.**
==24==Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
==25==We’ll speak with thee at sea. At land, thou know’st
==26==How much we do o’er-count thee.

**POM.**
==26==                  At land indeed
==27==Thou dost o’er-count me of my father’s house;
==28==But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
==29==Remain in’t as thou mayst.

**LEP.**
==29==              Be pleas’d to tell us
==30==(For this is from the present) how you take
==31==The offers we have sent you.

**CAES.**
==31==                There’s the point.

**ANT.**
==32==Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
==33==What it is worth embrac’d.

**CAES.**
==33==              And what may follow,
==34==To try a larger fortune.

**POM.**
==34==              You have made me offer
==35==Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
==36==Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
==37==Measures of wheat to Rome. This ’greed upon,
==38==To part with unhack’d edges and bear back
==39==Our targes undinted.

**CAES., ANT., LEP.**
==39==           That’s our offer.

**POM.**
==39==                     Know then
==40==I came before you here a man prepar’d
==41==To take this offer; but Mark Antony
==42==Put me to some impatience. Though I lose
==43==The praise of it by telling, you must know,
==44==When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
==45==Your mother came to Sicily and did find
==46==Her welcome friendly.

**ANT.**
==46==              I have heard it, Pompey,
==47==And am well studied for a liberal thanks,
==48==Which I do owe you.

**POM.**
==48==           Let me have your hand.
==49==I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

**ANT.**
==50==The beds i’ th’ East are soft, and thanks to you,
==51==That call’d me timelier than my purpose hither;
==52==For I have gain’d by’t.

**CAES.**
==52==              Since I saw you last,
==53==There’s a change upon you.

**POM.**
==53==              Well, I know not
==54==What counts harsh Fortune casts upon my face,
==55==But in my bosom shall she never come,
==56==To make my heart her vassal.

**LEP.**
==56==                Well met here.

**POM.**
==57==I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed.
==58==I crave our composition may be written
==59==And seal’d between us.

**CAES.**
==59==              That’s the next to do.

**POM.**
==60==We’ll feast each other ere we part, and let’s
==61==Draw lots who shall begin.

**ANT.**
==61==              That will I, Pompey.

**POM.**
==62==No, Antony, take the lot; but first
==63==Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
==64==Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
==65==Grew fat with feasting there.

**ANT.**
==65==                You have heard much.

**POM.**
==66==I have fair meanings, sir.

**ANT.**
==66==              And fair words to them.

**POM.**
==67==Then so much have I heard;
==68==And I have heard, Apollodorus carried⁠—

**ENO.**
==69==No more of that; he did so.

**POM.**
==69==              What, I pray you?

**ENO.**
==70==A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

**POM.**
==71==I know thee now: how far’st thou, soldier?

**ENO.**
==71==                         Well,
==72==And well am like to do, for I perceive
==73==Four feasts are toward.

**POM.**
==73==              Let me shake thy hand,
==74==I never hated thee. I have seen thee fight,
==75==When I have envied thy behavior.

**ENO.**
==75==                  Sir,
==76==I never lov’d you much, but I ha’ prais’d ye
==77==When you have well deserv’d ten times as much
==78==As I have said you did.

**POM.**
==78==              Enjoy thy plainness,
==79==It nothing ill becomes thee.
==80==Aboard my galley I invite you all.
==81==Will you lead, lords?

**CAES., ANT., LEP.**
==81==           Show ’s the way, sir.

**POM.**
==81==                         Come.

*Exeunt. Manent Enobarbus and Menas.*

**MENAS.**
*(Aside.)*
==82==Thy father, Pompey, would ne’er have made this treaty.—You and I have known, sir.

**ENO.**
==83==At sea, I think.

**MENAS.**
==84==We have, sir.

**ENO.**
==85==You have done well by water.

**MENAS.**
==86==And you by land.

**ENO.**
==87==I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.

**MENAS.**
==88==Nor what I have done by water.

**ENO.**
==89==Yes, something you can deny for your own safety: you have been a great thief by sea.

**MENAS.**
==90==And you by land.

**ENO.**
==91==There I deny my land service. But give me your hand, Menas; if our eyes had authority, here they might take two thieves kissing.

**MENAS.**
==92==All men’s faces are true, whatsome’er their hands are.

**ENO.**
==93==But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

**MENAS.**
==94==No slander, they steal hearts.

**ENO.**
==95==We came hither to fight with you.

**MENAS.**
==96==For my part, I am sorry it is turn’d to a drinking. Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

**ENO.**
==97==If he do, sure he cannot weep’t back again.

**MENAS.**
==98==Y’ have said, sir. We look’d not for Mark Antony here. Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

**ENO.**
==99==Caesar’s sister is call’d Octavia.

**MENAS.**
==100==True, sir, she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

**ENO.**
==101==But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

**MENAS.**
==102==Pray ye, sir?

**ENO.**
==103==’Tis true.

**MENAS.**
==104==Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.

**ENO.**
==105==If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would not prophesy so.

**MENAS.**
==106==I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.

**ENO.**
==107==I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.

**MENAS.**
==108==Who would not have his wife so?

**ENO.**
==109==Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and (as I said before) that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.

**MENAS.**
==110==And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard? I have a health for you.

**ENO.**
==111==I shall take it, sir; we have us’d our throats in Egypt.

**MENAS.**
==112==Come, let’s away.

*Exeunt.*
