## Act 3, Scene 13
[[Act 3, Scene 12|← Act 3, Scene 12]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Alexandria. Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Enobarbus, Charmian, and Iras.*

**CLEO.**
==1==What shall we do, Enobarbus?

**ENO.**
==1==                Think, and die.

**CLEO.**
==2==Is Antony or we in fault for this?

**ENO.**
==3==Antony only, that would make his will
==4==Lord of his reason. What though you fled
==5==From that great face of war, whose several ranges
==6==Frighted each other? Why should he follow?
==7==The itch of his affection should not then
==8==Have nick’d his captainship, at such a point,
==9==When half to half the world oppos’d, he being
==10==The mered question. ’Twas a shame no less
==11==Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
==12==And leave his navy gazing.

**CLEO.**
==12==              Prithee peace.

*Enter the Ambassador with Antony.*

**ANT.**
==13==Is that his answer?

**AMB.**
==14==Ay, my lord.

**ANT.**
==15==The Queen shall then have courtesy, so she
==16==Will yield us up.

**AMB.**
==16==        He says so.

**ANT.**
==16==              Let her know’t.
==17==To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
==18==And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
==19==With principalities.

**CLEO.**
==19==           That head, my lord?

**ANT.**
==20==To him again, tell him he wears the rose
==21==Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
==22==Something particular. His coin, ships, legions,
==23==May be a coward’s, whose ministers would prevail
==24==Under the service of a child as soon
==25==As i’ th’ command of Caesar. I dare him therefore
==26==To lay his gay comparisons apart,
==27==And answer me declin’d, sword against sword,
==28==Ourselves alone. I’ll write it. Follow me.

*Exeunt Antony and Ambassador.*

**ENO.**
*(Aside.)*
==29==Yes, like enough! High-battled Caesar will
==30==Unstate his happiness, and be stag’d to th’ show
==31==Against a sworder! I see men’s judgments are
==32==A parcel of their fortunes, and things outward
==33==Do draw the inward quality after them,
==34==To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
==35==Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
==36==Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdu’d
==37==His judgment too.

*Enter First Egyptian Servant.*

**1. EGYPT. SERV.**
==37==           A messenger from Caesar.

**CLEO.**
==38==What, no more ceremony? See, my women,
==39==Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
==40==That kneel’d unto the buds. Admit him, sir.

*Exit First Egyptian Servant.*

**ENO.**
*(Aside.)*
==41==Mine honesty and I begin to square.
==42==The loyalty well held to fools does make
==43==Our faith mere folly; yet he that can endure
==44==To follow with allegiance a fall’n lord
==45==Does conquer him that did his master conquer,
==46==And earns a place i’ th’ story.

*Enter Thidias.*

**CLEO.**
==46==                Caesar’s will?

**THID.**
==47==Hear it apart.

**CLEO.**
==47==        None but friends: say boldly.

**THID.**
==48==So haply are they friends to Antony.

**ENO.**
==49==He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has,
==50==Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
==51==Will leap to be his friend; for us, you know
==52==Whose he is we are, and that is Caesar’s.

**THID.**
==52==                         So.
==53==Thus then, thou most renown’d: Caesar entreats
==54==Not to consider in what case thou stand’st
==55==Further than he is Caesar.

**CLEO.**
==55==              Go on: right royal.

**THID.**
==56==He knows that you embrace not Antony
==57==As you did love, but as you fear’d him.

**CLEO.**
==57==                     O!

**THID.**
==58==The scars upon your honor, therefore, he
==59==Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
==60==Not as deserved.

**CLEO.**
==60==           He is a god and knows
==61==What is most right. Mine honor was not yielded,
==62==But conquer’d merely.

**ENO.**
*(Aside.)*
==62==           To be sure of that,
==63==I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky
==64==That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
==65==Thy dearest quit thee.

*Exit Enobarbus.*

**THID.**
==65==              Shall I say to Caesar
==66==What you require of him? For he partly begs
==67==To be desir’d to give. It much would please him,
==68==That of his fortunes you should make a staff
==69==To lean upon; but it would warm his spirits
==70==To hear from me you had left Antony,
==71==And put yourself under his shroud,
==72==The universal landlord.

**CLEO.**
==72==              What’s your name?

**THID.**
==73==My name is Thidias.

**CLEO.**
==73==           Most kind messenger,
==74==Say to great Caesar this in deputation:
==75==I kiss his conqu’ring hand. Tell him, I am prompt
==76==To lay my crown at ’s feet, and there to kneel.
==77==Tell him, from his all-obeying breath I hear
==78==The doom of Egypt.

**THID.**
==78==           ’Tis your noblest course.
==79==Wisdom and fortune combating together,
==80==If that the former dare but what it can,
==81==No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
==82==My duty on your hand.

**CLEO.**
==82==              Your Caesar’s father oft
==83==(When he hath mus’d of taking kingdoms in) 
==84==Bestow’d his lips on that unworthy place,
==85==As it rain’d kisses.

*Enter Antony and Enobarbus.*

**ANT.**
==85==           Favors? By Jove that thunders!
==86==What art thou, fellow?

**THID.**
==86==              One that but performs
==87==The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
==88==To have command obey’d.

**ENO.**
*(Aside.)*
==88==              You will be whipt.

**ANT.**
*(Calling for Servants.)*
==89==Approach there!—Ah, you kite!—Now gods and devils!
==90==Authority melts from me. Of late, when I cried “Ho!”
==91==Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth
==92==And cry, “Your will?”—Have you no ears?—I am
==93==Antony yet.
*(Enter First Egyptian Servant, others following.)*
==93==        Take hence this Jack and whip him.

**ENO.**
*(Aside.)*
==94==’Tis better playing with a lion’s whelp
==95==Than with an old one dying.

**ANT.**
==95==                Moon and stars!
==96==Whip him. Were’t twenty of the greatest tributaries
==97==That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
==98==So saucy with the hand of she here—what’s her name,
==99==Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
==100==Till like a boy you see him cringe his face,
==101==And whine aloud for mercy. Take him hence.

**THID.**
==102==Mark Antony⁠—

**ANT.**
==102==        Tug him away. Being whipt,
==103==Bring him again; the Jack of Caesar’s shall
==104==Bear us an arrant to him.
*(Exeunt Egyptian Servants with Thidias.)*
==105==You were half blasted ere I knew you; ha?
==106==Have I my pillow left unpress’d in Rome,
==107==Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
==108==And by a gem of women, to be abus’d
==109==By one that looks on feeders?

**CLEO.**
==109==                Good my lord⁠—

**ANT.**
==110==You have been a boggler ever,
==111==But when we in our viciousness grow hard
==112==(O misery on’t!), the wise gods seel our eyes,
==113==In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us
==114==Adore our errors, laugh at ’s while we strut
==115==To our confusion.

**CLEO.**
==115==           O, is’t come to this?

**ANT.**
==116==I found you as a morsel, cold upon
==117==Dead Caesar’s trencher; nay, you were a fragment
==118==Of Cneius Pompey’s—besides what hotter hours,
==119==Unregist’red in vulgar fame, you have
==120==Luxuriously pick’d out; for I am sure,
==121==Though you can guess what temperance should be,
==122==You know not what it is.

**CLEO.**
==122==              Wherefore is this?

**ANT.**
==123==To let a fellow that will take rewards
==124==And say “God quit you!” be familiar with
==125==My playfellow, your hand, this kingly seal
==126==And plighter of high hearts! O that I were
==127==Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
==128==The horned herd! For I have savage cause,
==129==And to proclaim it civilly were like
==130==A halter’d neck which does the hangman thank
==131==For being yare about him.
*(Enter First Egyptian Servant with Thidias.)*
==131==                Is he whipt?

**1. EGYPT. SERV.**
==132==Soundly, my lord.

**ANT.**
==132==        Cried he? And begg’d ’a pardon?

**1. EGYPT. SERV.**
==133==He did ask favor.

**ANT.**
==134==If that thy father live, let him repent
==135==Thou wast not made his daughter, and be thou sorry
==136==To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
==137==Thou hast been whipt for following him. Henceforth
==138==The white hand of a lady fever thee,
==139==Shake thou to look on’t. Get thee back to Caesar,
==140==Tell him thy entertainment. Look thou say
==141==He makes me angry with him; for he seems
==142==Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
==143==Not what he knew I was. He makes me angry,
==144==And at this time most easy ’tis to do’t:
==145==When my good stars, that were my former guides,
==146==Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
==147==Into th’ abysm of hell. If he mislike
==148==My speech and what is done, tell him he has
==149==Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
==150==He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
==151==As he shall like, to quit me. Urge it thou:
==152==Hence with thy stripes, be gone!

*Exit Thidias.*

**CLEO.**
==153==Have you done yet?

**ANT.**
==153==           Alack, our terrene moon
==154==Is now eclips’d, and it portends alone
==155==The fall of Antony!

**CLEO.**
==155==           I must stay his time.

**ANT.**
==156==To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
==157==With one that ties his points?

**CLEO.**
==157==                Not know me yet?

**ANT.**
==158==Cold-hearted toward me?

**CLEO.**
==158==              Ah, dear, if I be so,
==159==From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
==160==And poison it in the source, and the first stone
==161==Drop in my neck; as it determines, so
==162==Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite,
==163==Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
==164==Together with my brave Egyptians all,
==165==By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
==166==Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
==167==Have buried them for prey!

**ANT.**
==167==                I am satisfied.
==168==Caesar sets down in Alexandria, where
==169==I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
==170==Hath nobly held; our sever’d navy too
==171==Have knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sea-like.
==172==Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
==173==If from the field I shall return once more
==174==To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
==175==I and my sword will earn our chronicle.
==176==There’s hope in’t yet.

**CLEO.**
==176==           That’s my brave lord!

**ANT.**
==177==I will be treble-sinew’d, hearted, breath’d,
==178==And fight maliciously; for when mine hours
==179==Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
==180==Of me for jests; but now I’ll set my teeth,
==181==And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
==182==Let’s have one other gaudy night. Call to me
==183==All my sad captains, fill our bowls once more;
==184==Let’s mock the midnight bell.

**CLEO.**
==184==                It is my birthday,
==185==I had thought t’ have held it poor; but since my lord
==186==Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

**ANT.**
==187==We will yet do well.

**CLEO.**
==188==Call all his noble captains to my lord.

**ANT.**
==189==Do so, we’ll speak to them, and tonight I’ll force
==190==The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen,
==191==There’s sap in’t yet. The next time I do fight,
==192==I’ll make death love me; for I will contend
==193==Even with his pestilent scythe.

*Exeunt all but Enobarbus.*

**ENO.**
==194==Now he’ll outstare the lightning: to be furious
==195==Is to be frighted out of fear, and in that mood
==196==The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still
==197==A diminution in our captain’s brain
==198==Restores his heart. When valor preys on reason,
==199==It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
==200==Some way to leave him.

*Exit.*
