## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Alexandria. Before Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter a company of Antony’s Soldiers.*

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
Brother, good night; tomorrow is the day.

**ANT. 2. SOLD.**
It will determine one way; fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
Nothing. What news?

**ANT. 2. SOLD.**
Belike ’tis but a rumor. Good night to you.

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
Well, sir, good night.

*They meet other Soldiers.*

**ANT. 2. SOLD.**
Soldiers, have careful watch.

**ANT. 3. SOLD.**
And you. Good night, good night.

*They place themselves in every corner of the stage.*

**ANT. 2. SOLD.**
Here we. And if tomorrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
              ’Tis a brave army,
And full of purpose.

*Music of the hoboys is under the stage.*

**ANT. 2. SOLD.**
           Peace, what noise?

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
                       List, list!

**ANT. 2. SOLD.**
Hark!

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
    Music i’ th’ air.

**ANT. 3. SOLD.**
              Under the earth.

**ANT. 4. SOLD.**
It signs well, does it not?

**ANT. 3. SOLD.**
                No.

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
                  Peace, I say.
What should this mean?

**ANT. 2. SOLD.**
’Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony lov’d,
Now leaves him.

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
        Walk; let’s see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do.

**ANT. 2. SOLD.**
           How now, masters?

**ALL ANT. SOLD.**
*(Speak together.)*
                       How now?
How now? Do you hear this?

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
                Ay, is’t not strange?

**ANT. 3. SOLD.**
Do you hear, masters? Do you hear?

**ANT. 1. SOLD.**
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let’s see how it will give off.

**ALL ANT. SOLD.**
                Content. ’Tis strange.

*Exeunt.*
