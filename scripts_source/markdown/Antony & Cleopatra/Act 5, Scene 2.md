## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]]

*Alexandria. Another room in a monument in Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Iras, and Mardian.*

**CLEO.**
==1==My desolation does begin to make
==2==A better life. ’Tis paltry to be Caesar;
==3==Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave,
==4==A minister of her will: and it is great
==5==To do that thing that ends all other deeds,
==6==Which shackles accidents and bolts up change,
==7==Which sleeps, and never palates more the dung,
==8==The beggar’s nurse and Caesar’s.

*Enter Proculeius.*

**PROC.**
==9==Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt,
==10==And bids thee study on what fair demands
==11==Thou mean’st to have him grant thee.

**CLEO.**
==11==                  What’s thy name?

**PROC.**
==12==My name is Proculeius.

**CLEO.**
==12==              Antony
==13==Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but
==14==I do not greatly care to be deceiv’d,
==15==That have no use for trusting. If your master
==16==Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
==17==That majesty, to keep decorum, must
==18==No less beg than a kingdom. If he please
==19==To give me conquer’d Egypt for my son,
==20==He gives me so much of mine own as I
==21==Will kneel to him with thanks.

**PROC.**
==21==                Be of good cheer;
==22==Y’ are fall’n into a princely hand, fear nothing.
==23==Make your full reference freely to my lord,
==24==Who is so full of grace that it flows over
==25==On all that need. Let me report to him
==26==Your sweet dependency, and you shall find
==27==A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
==28==Where he for grace is kneel’d to.

**CLEO.**
==28==                  Pray you tell him
==29==I am his fortune’s vassal, and I send him
==30==The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
==31==A doctrine of obedience, and would gladly
==32==Look him i’ th’ face.

**PROC.**
==32==           This I’ll report, dear lady.
==33==Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
==34==Of him that caus’d it.
*(Enter Roman Soldiers behind Cleopatra.)*
==35==You see how easily she may be surpris’d.
==36==Guard her till Caesar come.

**IRAS.**
==37==Royal Queen!

**CHAR.**
==38==O Cleopatra! Thou art taken, Queen.

**CLEO.**
==39==Quick, quick, good hands.

*Drawing a dagger.*

**PROC.**
==39==              Hold, worthy lady, hold!
*(Seizes and disarms her.)*
==40==Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
==41==Reliev’d, but not betray’d.

**CLEO.**
==41==              What, of death too,
==42==That rids our dogs of languish?

**PROC.**
==42==                  Cleopatra,
==43==Do not abuse my master’s bounty by
==44==Th’ undoing of yourself. Let the world see
==45==His nobleness well acted, which your death
==46==Will never let come forth.

**CLEO.**
==46==              Where art thou, death?
==47==Come hither, come! Come, come, and take a queen
==48==Worth many babes and beggars!

**PROC.**
==48==                  O, temperance, lady!

**CLEO.**
==49==Sir, I will eat no meat, I’ll not drink, sir;
==50==If idle talk will once be necessary,
==51==I’ll not sleep neither. This mortal house I’ll ruin,
==52==Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
==53==Will not wait pinion’d at your master’s court,
==54==Nor once be chastis’d with the sober eye
==55==Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up,
==56==And show me to the shouting varlotry
==57==Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
==58==Be gentle grave unto me! Rather on Nilus’ mud
==59==Lay me stark-nak’d, and let the water-flies
==60==Blow me into abhorring! Rather make
==61==My country’s high pyramides my gibbet,
==62==And hang me up in chains!

**PROC.**
==62==              You do extend
==63==These thoughts of horror further than you shall
==64==Find cause in Caesar.

*Enter Dolabella.*

**DOL.**
==64==              Proculeius,
==65==What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
==66==And he hath sent for thee. For the Queen,
==67==I’ll take her to my guard.

**PROC.**
==67==              So, Dolabella,
==68==It shall content me best. Be gentle to her.
*(To Cleopatra.)*
==69==To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
==70==If you’ll employ me to him.

**CLEO.**
==70==                Say, I would die.

*Exit Proculeius with Roman Soldiers.*

**DOL.**
==71==Most noble Empress, you have heard of me?

**CLEO.**
==72==I cannot tell.

**DOL.**
==72==        Assuredly you know me.

**CLEO.**
==73==No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
==74==You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
==75==Is’t not your trick?

**DOL.**
==75==           I understand not, madam.

**CLEO.**
==76==I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony.
==77==O, such another sleep, that I might see
==78==But such another man!

**DOL.**
==78==              If it might please ye⁠—

**CLEO.**
==79==His face was as the heav’ns, and therein stuck
==80==A sun and moon, which kept their course, and lighted
==81==The little O, th’ earth.

**DOL.**
==81==              Most sovereign creature⁠—

**CLEO.**
==82==His legs bestrid the ocean, his rear’d arm
==83==Crested the world, his voice was propertied
==84==As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
==85==But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
==86==He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
==87==There was no winter in’t; an autumn it was
==88==That grew the more by reaping. His delights
==89==Were dolphin-like, they show’d his back above
==90==The element they liv’d in. In his livery
==91==Walk’d crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
==92==As plates dropp’d from his pocket.

**DOL.**
==92==                  Cleopatra!

**CLEO.**
==93==Think you there was or might be such a man
==94==As this I dreamt of?

**DOL.**
==94==           Gentle madam, no.

**CLEO.**
==95==You lie up to the hearing of the gods!
==96==But if there be, nor ever were one such,
==97==It’s past the size of dreaming. Nature wants stuff
==98==To vie strange forms with fancy; yet t’ imagine
==99==An Antony were nature’s piece ’gainst fancy,
==100==Condemning shadows quite.

**DOL.**
==100==              Hear me, good madam:
==101==Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
==102==As answering to the weight. Would I might never
==103==O’ertake pursu’d success, but I do feel,
==104==By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
==105==My very heart at root.

**CLEO.**
==105==           I thank you, sir.
==106==Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

**DOL.**
==107==I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

**CLEO.**
==108==Nay, pray you, sir.

**DOL.**
==108==           Though he be honorable⁠—

**CLEO.**
==109==He’ll lead me then in triumph?

**DOL.**
==110==Madam, he will, I know’t.

*Flourish.*

*Enter Proculeius, Caesar, Gallus, Maecenas, and others of his Train, Seleucus following.*

**ALL CAES. TRAIN.**
==111==Make way there! Caesar!

**CAES.**
==112==Which is the Queen of Egypt?

**DOL.**
==113==It is the Emperor, madam.

*Cleopatra kneels.*

**CAES.**
==114==Arise, you shall not kneel.
==115==I pray you rise, rise, Egypt.

**CLEO.**
==115==                Sir, the gods
==116==Will have it thus, my master and my lord
==117==I must obey.

**CAES.**
==118==Take to you no hard thoughts.
==119==The record of what injuries you did us,
==120==Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
==121==As things but done by chance.

**CLEO.**
==121==                Sole sir o’ th’ world,
==122==I cannot project mine own cause so well
==123==To make it clear, but do confess I have
==124==Been laden with like frailties which before
==125==Have often sham’d our sex.

**CAES.**
==125==              Cleopatra, know
==126==We will extenuate rather than enforce.
==127==If you apply yourself to our intents,
==128==Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
==129==A benefit in this change; but if you seek
==130==To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
==131==Antony’s course, you shall bereave yourself
==132==Of my good purposes, and put your children
==133==To that destruction which I’ll guard them from
==134==If thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave.

**CLEO.**
==135==And may, through all the world; ’tis yours, and we,
==136==Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
==137==Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.

**CAES.**
==138==You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.

**CLEO.**
*(Giving a scroll.)*
==139==This is the brief: of money, plate, and jewels
==140==I am possess’d of; ’tis exactly valued,
==141==Not petty things admitted. Where’s Seleucus?

**SEL.**
==142==Here, madam.

**CLEO.**
==143==This is my treasurer, let him speak, my lord,
==144==Upon his peril, that I have reserv’d
==145==To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.

**SEL.**
==146==Madam,
==147==I had rather seel my lips than to my peril
==148==Speak that which is not.

**CLEO.**
==148==              What have I kept back?

**SEL.**
==149==Enough to purchase what you have made known.

**CAES.**
==150==Nay, blush not, Cleopatra, I approve
==151==Your wisdom in the deed.

**CLEO.**
==151==              See, Caesar! O, behold,
==152==How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours,
==153==And should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
==154==The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
==155==Even make me wild. O slave, of no more trust
==156==Than love that’s hir’d! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt
==157==Go back, I warrant thee; but I’ll catch thine eyes
==158==Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog!
==159==O rarely base!

**CAES.**
==159==        Good Queen, let us entreat you.

**CLEO.**
==160==O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
==161==That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
==162==Doing the honor of thy lordliness
==163==To one so meek, that mine own servant should
==164==Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
==165==Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
==166==That I some lady trifles have reserv’d,
==167==Immoment toys, things of such dignity
==168==As we greet modern friends withal, and say
==169==Some nobler token I have kept apart
==170==For Livia and Octavia, to induce
==171==Their mediation, must I be unfolded
==172==With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me
==173==Beneath the fall I have.
*(To Seleucus.)*
==173==              Prithee go hence,
==174==Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
==175==Through th’ ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man,
==176==Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

**CAES.**
==176==                  Forbear, Seleucus.

*Exit Seleucus.*

**CLEO.**
==177==Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought
==178==For things that others do; and when we fall,
==179==We answer others’ merits in our name,
==180==Are therefore to be pitied.

**CAES.**
==180==              Cleopatra,
==181==Not what you have reserv’d, nor what acknowledg’d,
==182==Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest. Still be’t yours,
==183==Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe
==184==Caesar’s no merchant, to make prize with you
==185==Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer’d,
==186==Make not your thoughts your prisons; no, dear Queen,
==187==For we intend so to dispose you as
==188==Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep.
==189==Our care and pity is so much upon you,
==190==That we remain your friend, and so *adieu*.

**CLEO.**
==191==My master, and my lord!

**CAES.**
==191==              Not so. *Adieu*.

*Flourish. Exeunt Caesar and his Train.*

**CLEO.**
==192==He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
==193==Be noble to myself. But hark thee, Charmian.

*Whispers Charmian.*

**IRAS.**
==194==Finish, good lady, the bright day is done,
==195==And we are for the dark.

**CLEO.**
==195==              Hie thee again.
==196==I have spoke already, and it is provided;
==197==Go put it to the haste.

**CHAR.**
==197==              Madam, I will.

*Enter Dolabella.*

**DOL.**
==198==Where’s the Queen?

**CHAR.**
==198==           Behold, sir.

*Exit.*

**CLEO.**
==198==                  Dolabella!

**DOL.**
==199==Madam, as thereto sworn by your command
==200==(Which my love makes religion to obey),
==201==I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
==202==Intends his journey, and within three days
==203==You with your children will he send before.
==204==Make your best use of this. I have perform’d
==205==Your pleasure and my promise.

**CLEO.**
==205==                  Dolabella,
==206==I shall remain your debtor.

**DOL.**
==206==              I your servant.
==207==*Adieu*, good Queen, I must attend on Caesar.

**CLEO.**
==208==Farewell, and thanks!
*(Exit Dolabella.)*
==208==           Now, Iras, what think’st thou?
==209==Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shall be shown
==210==In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves
==211==With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers shall
==212==Uplift us to the view. In their thick breaths,
==213==Rank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded,
==214==And forc’d to drink their vapor.

**IRAS.**
==214==                  The gods forbid!

**CLEO.**
==215==Nay, ’tis most certain, Iras. Saucy lictors
==216==Will catch at us like strumpets, and scald rhymers
==217==Ballad ’s out a’ tune. The quick comedians
==218==Extemporally will stage us, and present
==219==Our Alexandrian revels: Antony
==220==Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
==221==Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
==222==I’ th’ posture of a whore.

**IRAS.**
==222==              O the good gods!

**CLEO.**
==223==Nay, that’s certain.

**IRAS.**
==224==I’ll never see’t! For I am sure mine nails
==225==Are stronger than mine eyes.

**CLEO.**
==225==                Why, that’s the way
==226==To fool their preparation, and to conquer
==227==Their most absurd intents.
*(Enter Charmian.)*
==227==              Now, Charmian!
==228==Show me, my women, like a queen; go fetch
==229==My best attires. I am again for Cydnus
==230==To meet Mark Antony. Sirrah Iras, go.
==231==Now, noble Charmian, we’ll dispatch indeed,
==232==And when thou hast done this chore, I’ll give thee leave
==233==To play till doomsday.
*(To Iras.)*
==233==              Bring our crown and all.
*(Exit Iras. A noise within.)*
==234==Wherefore’s this noise?

*Enter First Roman Guard.*

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==234==              Here is a rural fellow
==235==That will not be denied your Highness’ presence.
==236==He brings you figs.

**CLEO.**
==237==Let him come in.
*(Exit First Roman Guard.)*
==237==           What poor an instrument
==238==May do a noble deed! He brings me liberty.
==239==My resolution’s plac’d, and I have nothing
==240==Of woman in me; now from head to foot
==241==I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
==242==No planet is of mine.

*Enter First Roman Guard and Clown with a basket.*

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==242==              This is the man.

**CLEO.**
==243==Avoid, and leave him.
*(Exit First Roman Guard.)*
==244==Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
==245==That kills and pains not?

**CLOWN.**
==246==Truly, I have him; but I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or never recover.

**CLEO.**
==247==Remember’st thou any that have died on’t?

**CLOWN.**
==248==Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday, a very honest woman—but something given to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty—how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt. Truly, she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm; but he that will believe all that they say, shall never be sav’d by half that they do. But this is most falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.

**CLEO.**
==249==Get thee hence, farewell.

**CLOWN.**
==250==I wish you all joy of the worm.

*Setting down his basket.*

**CLEO.**
==251==Farewell.

**CLOWN.**
==252==You must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.

**CLEO.**
==253==Ay, ay, farewell.

**CLOWN.**
==254==Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people; for indeed, there is no goodness in the worm.

**CLEO.**
==255==Take thou no care, it shall be heeded.

**CLOWN.**
==256==Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is not worth the feeding.

**CLEO.**
==257==Will it eat me?

**CLOWN.**
==258==You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not. But truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women; for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five.

**CLEO.**
==259==Well, get thee gone, farewell.

**CLOWN.**
==260==Yes, forsooth; I wish you joy o’ th’ worm.

*Exit.*

*Enter Iras with a robe, crown, etc.*

**CLEO.**
==261==Give me my robe, put on my crown, I have
==262==Immortal longings in me. Now no more
==263==The juice of Egypt’s grape shall moist this lip.
==264==Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
==265==Antony call; I see him rouse himself
==266==To praise my noble act. I hear him mock
==267==The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
==268==To excuse their after wrath. Husband, I come!
==269==Now to that name my courage prove my title!
==270==I am fire and air; my other elements
==271==I give to baser life. So, have you done?
==272==Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
==273==Farewell, kind Charmian, Iras, long farewell.
*(Kisses them.)*
*(Iras falls and dies.)*
==274==Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
==275==If thou and nature can so gently part,
==276==The stroke of death is as a lover’s pinch,
==277==Which hurts, and is desir’d. Dost thou lie still?
==278==If thus thou vanishest, thou tell’st the world
==279==It is not worth leave-taking.

**CHAR.**
==280==Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain, that I may say
==281==The gods themselves do weep!

**CLEO.**
==281==                This proves me base.
==282==If she first meet the curled Antony,
==283==He’ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
==284==Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou mortal wretch,
*(To an asp, which she applies to her breast.)*
==285==With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
==286==Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool,
==287==Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
==288==That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
==289==Unpolicied!

**CHAR.**
==289==        O eastern star!

**CLEO.**
==289==                Peace, peace!
==290==Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
==291==That sucks the nurse asleep?

**CHAR.**
==291==                O, break! O, break!

**CLEO.**
==292==As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle⁠—
==293==O Antony!—Nay, I will take thee too:
*(Applying another asp to her arm.)*
==294==What should I stay⁠—

*Dies.*

**CHAR.**
==295==In this vild world? So fare thee well!
==296==Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
==297==A lass unparallel’d. Downy windows, close,
==298==And golden Phoebus never be beheld
==299==Of eyes again so royal! Your crown’s awry,
==300==I’ll mend it, and then play⁠—

*Enter the Roman Guards rustling in.*

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==301==Where’s the Queen?

**CHAR.**
==301==           Speak softly, wake her not.

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==302==Caesar hath sent⁠—

**CHAR.**
==302==           Too slow a messenger.
*(Applies an asp.)*
==303==O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==304==Approach ho, all’s not well; Caesar’s beguil’d.

**2. ROM. GUARD.**
==305==There’s Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==306==What work is here, Charmian? Is this well done?

**CHAR.**
==307==It is well done, and fitting for a princess
==308==Descended of so many royal kings.
==309==Ah, soldier!

*Charmian dies.*

*Enter Dolabella.*

**DOL.**
==310==How goes it here?

**2. ROM. GUARD.**
==310==           All dead.

**DOL.**
==310==                Caesar, thy thoughts
==311==Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
==312==To see perform’d the dreaded act which thou
==313==So sought’st to hinder.

*Enter Caesar and all his Train, marching.*

**ALL CAES. TRAIN.**
==314==A way there, a way for Caesar!

**DOL.**
==315==O, sir, you are too sure an augurer;
==316==That you did fear is done.

**CAES.**
==316==              Bravest at the last,
==317==She levell’d at our purposes, and being royal
==318==Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
==319==I do not see them bleed.

**DOL.**
==319==              Who was last with them?

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==320==A simple countryman, that brought her figs.
==321==This was his basket.

**CAES.**
==321==           Poison’d then.

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==321==                     O Caesar,
==322==This Charmian liv’d but now, she stood and spake.
==323==I found her trimming up the diadem
==324==On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood,
==325==And on the sudden dropp’d.

**CAES.**
==325==              O noble weakness!
==326==If they had swallow’d poison, ’twould appear
==327==By external swelling; but she looks like sleep,
==328==As she would catch another Antony
==329==In her strong toil of grace.

**DOL.**
==329==              Here, on her breast,
==330==There is a vent of blood, and something blown;
==331==The like is on her arm.

**1. ROM. GUARD.**
==332==This is an aspic’s trail, and these fig leaves
==333==Have slime upon them, such as th’ aspic leaves
==334==Upon the caves of Nile.

**CAES.**
==334==              Most probable
==335==That so she died; for her physician tells me
==336==She hath pursu’d conclusions infinite
==337==Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed,
==338==And bear her women from the monument.
==339==She shall be buried by her Antony;
==340==No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
==341==A pair so famous. High events as these
==342==Strike those that make them; and their story is
==343==No less in pity than his glory which
==344==Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
