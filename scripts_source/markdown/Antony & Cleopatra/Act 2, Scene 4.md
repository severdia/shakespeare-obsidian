## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Rome. A street.*

*Enter Lepidus, Maecenas, and Agrippa.*

**LEP.**
Trouble yourselves no further; pray you hasten
Your generals after.

**AGR.**
           Sir, Mark Antony
Will e’en but kiss Octavia, and we’ll follow.

**LEP.**
Till I shall see you in your soldier’s dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.

**MAEC.**
                     We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
Before you, Lepidus.

**LEP.**
           Your way is shorter,
My purposes do draw me much about.
You’ll win two days upon me.

**BOTH MAEC. AND AGR.**
                Sir, good success!

**LEP.**
Farewell.

*Exeunt.*
