## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Alexandria. Another room in Cleopatra’s palace.*

*Enter Cleopatra, Charmian, Alexas, and Iras.*

**CLEO.**
==1==Where is he?

**CHAR.**
==1==        I did not see him since.

**CLEO.**
==2==See where he is, who’s with him, what he does.
==3==I did not send you. If you find him sad,
==4==Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
==5==That I am sudden sick. Quick, and return.

*Exit Alexas.*

**CHAR.**
==6==Madam, methinks if you did love him dearly,
==7==You do not hold the method to enforce
==8==The like from him.

**CLEO.**
==8==           What should I do, I do not?

**CHAR.**
==9==In each thing give him way, cross him in nothing.

**CLEO.**
==10==Thou teachest like a fool: the way to lose him.

**CHAR.**
==11==Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear.
==12==In time we hate that which we often fear.
*(Enter Antony.)*
==13==But here comes Antony.

**CLEO.**
==13==              I am sick and sullen.

**ANT.**
==14==I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose⁠—

**CLEO.**
==15==Help me away, dear Charmian, I shall fall.
==16==It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
==17==Will not sustain it.

**ANT.**
==17==           Now, my dearest queen⁠—

**CLEO.**
==18==Pray you stand farther from me.

**ANT.**
==18==                What’s the matter?

**CLEO.**
==19==I know by that same eye there’s some good news.
==20==What, says the married woman you may go?
==21==Would she had never given you leave to come!
==22==Let her not say ’tis I that keep you here,
==23==I have no power upon you; hers you are.

**ANT.**
==24==The gods best know⁠—

**CLEO.**
==24==           O, never was there queen
==25==So mightily betrayed! Yet at the first
==26==I saw the treasons planted.

**ANT.**
==26==              Cleopatra⁠—

**CLEO.**
==27==Why should I think you can be mine, and true
==28==(Though you in swearing shake the throned gods),
==29==Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
==30==To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
==31==Which break themselves in swearing!

**ANT.**
==31==                     Most sweet queen⁠—

**CLEO.**
==32==Nay, pray you seek no color for your going,
==33==But bid farewell, and go. When you sued staying,
==34==Then was the time for words; no going then;
==35==Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
==36==Bliss in our brows’ bent; none our parts so poor
==37==But was a race of heaven. They are so still,
==38==Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
==39==Art turn’d the greatest liar.

**ANT.**
==39==              How now, lady?

**CLEO.**
==40==I would I had thy inches, thou shouldst know
==41==There were a heart in Egypt.

**ANT.**
==41==                Hear me, Queen:
==42==The strong necessity of time commands
==43==Our services awhile; but my full heart
==44==Remains in use with you. Our Italy
==45==Shines o’er with civil swords; Sextus Pompeius
==46==Makes his approaches to the port of Rome;
==47==Equality of two domestic powers
==48==Breed scrupulous faction; the hated, grown to strength,
==49==Are newly grown to love; the condemn’d Pompey,
==50==Rich in his father’s honor, creeps apace
==51==Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
==52==Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten,
==53==And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
==54==By any desperate change. My more particular,
==55==And that which most with you should safe my going,
==56==Is Fulvia’s death.

**CLEO.**
==57==Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
==58==It does from childishness. Can Fulvia die?

**ANT.**
==59==She’s dead, my queen.
==60==Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
==61==The garboils she awak’d: at the last, best,
==62==See when and where she died.

**CLEO.**
==62==                O most false love!
==63==Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
==64==With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
==65==In Fulvia’s death, how mine receiv’d shall be.

**ANT.**
==66==Quarrel no more, but be prepar’d to know
==67==The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
==68==As you shall give th’ advice. By the fire
==69==That quickens Nilus’ slime, I go from hence
==70==Thy soldier, servant, making peace or war
==71==As thou affects.

**CLEO.**
==71==        Cut my lace, Charmian, come!
==72==But let it be; I am quickly ill, and well,
==73==So Antony loves.

**ANT.**
==73==           My precious queen, forbear,
==74==And give true evidence to his love, which stands
==75==An honorable trial.

**CLEO.**
==75==           So Fulvia told me.
==76==I prithee turn aside, and weep for her,
==77==Then bid *adieu* to me, and say the tears
==78==Belong to Egypt. Good now, play one scene
==79==Of excellent dissembling, and let it look
==80==Like perfect honor.

**ANT.**
==80==           You’ll heat my blood; no more.

**CLEO.**
==81==You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

**ANT.**
==82==Now, by my sword⁠—

**CLEO.**
==82==           And target.—Still he mends.
==83==But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
==84==How this Herculean Roman does become
==85==The carriage of his chafe.

**ANT.**
==86==I’ll leave you, lady.

**CLEO.**
==86==           Courteous lord, one word:
==87==Sir, you and I must part, but that’s not it;
==88==Sir, you and I have lov’d, but there’s not it;
==89==That you know well. Something it is I would⁠—
==90==O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
==91==And I am all forgotten.

**ANT.**
==91==              But that your royalty
==92==Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
==93==For idleness itself.

**CLEO.**
==93==           ’Tis sweating labor
==94==To bear such idleness so near the heart
==95==As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me,
==96==Since my becomings kill me when they do not
==97==Eye well to you. Your honor calls you hence,
==98==Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly,
==99==And all the gods go with you! Upon your sword
==100==Sit laurel victory, and smooth success
==101==Be strew’d before your feet!

**ANT.**
==101==                Let us go. Come;
==102==Our separation so abides and flies,
==103==That thou residing here, goes yet with me;
==104==And I hence fleeting, here remain with thee.
==105==Away!

*Exeunt.*
