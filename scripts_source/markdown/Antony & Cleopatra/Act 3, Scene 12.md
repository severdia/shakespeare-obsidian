## Act 3, Scene 12
[[Act 3, Scene 11|← Act 3, Scene 11]] | [[Act 3, Scene 13|Act 3, Scene 13 →]]

*Egypt. Octavius Caesar’s camp.*

*Enter Caesar, Agrippa, Thidias, and Dolabella, with others.*

**CAES.**
==1== Let him appear that’s come from Antony.
==2== Know you him?

**DOL.**
==2==         Caesar, ’tis his schoolmaster,
==3== An argument that he is pluck’d, when hither
==4== He sends so poor a pinion of his wing,
==5== Which had superfluous kings for messengers
==6== Not many moons gone by.

*Enter Schoolmaster as Ambassador from Antony.*

**CAES.**
==6==               Approach and speak.

**AMB.**
==7== Such as I am, I come from Antony.
==8== I was of late as petty to his ends
==9== As is the morn-dew on the myrtle leaf
==10== To his grand sea.

**CAES.**
==10==            Be’t so, declare thine office.

**AMB.**
==11== Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
==12== Requires to live in Egypt, which not granted,
==13== He lessons his requests, and to thee sues
==14== To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
==15== A private man in Athens: this for him.
==16== Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness,
==17== Submits her to thy might, and of thee craves
==18== The circle of the Ptolomies for her heirs,
==19== Now hazarded to thy grace.

**CAES.**
==19==                 For Antony,
==20== I have no ears to his request. The Queen
==21== Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
==22== From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
==23== Or take his life there. This if she perform,
==24== She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.

**AMB.**
==25== Fortune pursue thee!

**CAES.**
==25==            Bring him through the bands.
*(Exit Ambassador.)*
*(To Thidias.)*
==26== To try thy eloquence, now ’tis time; dispatch.
==27== From Antony win Cleopatra, promise,
==28== And in our name, what she requires; add more,
==29== From thine invention, offers. Women are not
==30== In their best fortunes strong, but want will perjure
==31== The ne’er-touch’d vestal. Try thy cunning, Thidias,
==32== Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
==33== Will answer as a law.

**THID.**
==33==            Caesar, I go.

**CAES.**
==34== Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
==35== And what thou think’st his very action speaks
==36== In every power that moves.

**THID.**
==36==                 Caesar, I shall.

*Exeunt.*
