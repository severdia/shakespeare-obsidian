## Act 4, Scene 11
[[Act 4, Scene 10|← Act 4, Scene 10]] | [[Act 4, Scene 12|Act 4, Scene 12 →]]

*Another part of the field of battle between the camps.*

*Enter Caesar and his army.*

**CAES.**
But being charg’d, we will be still by land,
Which as I take’t we shall, for his best force
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
And hold our best advantage.

*Exeunt.*
