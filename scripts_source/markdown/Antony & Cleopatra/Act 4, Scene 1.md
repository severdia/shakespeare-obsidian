## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 13|← Act 3, Scene 13]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Before Alexandria. Octavius Caesar’s camp.*

*Enter Caesar, Agrippa, and Maecenas, with his army; Caesar reading a letter.*

**CAES.**
==1==He calls me boy, and chides as he had power
==2==To beat me out of Egypt. My messenger
==3==He hath whipt with rods, dares me to personal combat,
==4==Caesar to Antony. Let the old ruffian know
==5==I have many other ways to die; mean time
==6==Laugh at his challenge.

**MAEC.**
==6==              Caesar must think,
==7==When one so great begins to rage, he’s hunted
==8==Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
==9==Make boot of his distraction: never anger
==10==Made good guard for itself.

**CAES.**
==10==              Let our best heads
==11==Know that tomorrow the last of many battles
==12==We mean to fight. Within our files there are,
==13==Of those that serv’d Mark Antony but late,
==14==Enough to fetch him in. See it done,
==15==And feast the army; we have store to do’t,
==16==And they have earn’d the waste. Poor Antony!

*Exeunt.*
