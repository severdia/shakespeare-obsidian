## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. Brutus’s orchard.*

*Enter Brutus in his orchard.*

**BRU.**
==1== What, Lucius, ho!
==2== I cannot by the progress of the stars
==3== Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
==4== I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
==5== When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!

*Enter Lucius.*

**LUC.**
==6== Call’d you, my lord?

**BRU.**
==7== Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.
==8== When it is lighted, come and call me here.

**LUC.**
==9== I will, my lord.

*Exit.*

**BRU.**
==10== It must be by his death; and for my part,
==11== I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
==12== But for the general. He would be crown’d:
==13== How that might change his nature, there’s the question.
==14== It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,
==15== And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,
==16== And then I grant we put a sting in him
==17== That at his will he may do danger with.
==18== Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins
==19== Remorse from power; and to speak truth of Caesar,
==20== I have not known when his affections sway’d
==21== More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof
==22== That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,
==23== Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
==24== But when he once attains the upmost round,
==25== He then unto the ladder turns his back,
==26== Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
==27== By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;
==28== Then lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel
==29== Will bear no color for the thing he is,
==30== Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,
==31== Would run to these and these extremities;
==32== And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg,
==33== Which, hatch’d, would as his kind grow mischievous,
==34== And kill him in the shell.

*Enter Lucius.*

**LUC.**
==35== The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
==36== Searching the window for a flint, I found
==37== This paper, thus seal’d up, and I am sure
==38== It did not lie there when I went to bed.

*Gives him the letter.*

**BRU.**
==39== Get you to bed again, it is not day.
==40== Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?

**LUC.**
==41== I know not, sir.

**BRU.**
==42== Look in the calendar, and bring me word.

**LUC.**
==43== I will, sir.

*Exit.*

**BRU.**
==44== The exhalations whizzing in the air
==45== Give so much light that I may read by them.
*(Opens the letter and reads.)*
==46== *“Brutus, thou sleep’st; awake, and see thyself!*
==47== *Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!”*
==48== *“Brutus, thou sleep’st; awake!”*
==49== *Such instigations have been often dropp’d*
==50== *Where I have took them up.*
==51== “Shall Rome, etc.” Thus must I piece it out:
==52== Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome?
==53== My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
==54== The Tarquin drive when he was call’d a king.
==55== “Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated
==56== To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,
==57== If the redress will follow, thou receivest
==58== Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!

*Enter Lucius.*

**LUC.**
==59== Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.

*Knock within.*

**BRU.**
==60== ’Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.
*(Exit Lucius.)*
==61== Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
==62== I have not slept.
==63== Between the acting of a dreadful thing
==64== And the first motion, all the interim is
==65== Like a phantasma or a hideous dream.
==66== The Genius and the mortal instruments
==67== Are then in council; and the state of a man,
==68== Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
==69== The nature of an insurrection.

*Enter Lucius.*

**LUC.**
==70== Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door,
==71== Who doth desire to see you.

**BRU.**
==71==               Is he alone?

**LUC.**
==72== No, sir, there are more with him.

**BRU.**
==72==                 Do you know them?

**LUC.**
==73== No, sir, their hats are pluck’d about their ears,
==74== And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
==75== That by no means I may discover them
==76== By any mark of favor.

**BRU.**
==76==               Let ’em enter.
*(Exit Lucius.)*
==77== They are the faction. O Conspiracy,
==78== Sham’st thou to show thy dang’rous brow by night,
==79== When evils are most free? O then, by day
==80== Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
==81== To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy!
==82== Hide it in smiles and affability;
==83== For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
==84== Not Erebus itself were dim enough
==85== To hide thee from prevention.

*Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus, and Trebonius.*

**CAS.**
==86== I think we are too bold upon your rest.
==87== Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?

**BRU.**
==88== I have been up this hour, awake all night.
==89== Know I these men that come along with you?

**CAS.**
==90== Yes, every man of them; and no man here
==91== But honors you; and every one doth wish
==92== You had but that opinion of yourself
==93== Which every noble Roman bears of you.
==94== This is Trebonius.

**BRU.**
==94==            He is welcome hither.

**CAS.**
==95== This, Decius Brutus.

**BRU.**
==95==            He is welcome too.

**CAS.**
==96== This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.

**BRU.**
==97== They are all welcome.
==98== What watchful cares do interpose themselves
==99== Betwixt your eyes and night?

**CAS.**
==100== Shall I entreat a word?

*They whisper.*

**DEC.**
==101== Here lies the east; doth not the day break here?

**CASCA.**
==102== No.

**CIN.**
==103== O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon grey lines
==104== That fret the clouds are messengers of day.

**CASCA.**
==105== You shall confess that you are both deceiv’d.
==106== Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
==107== Which is a great way growing on the south,
==108== Weighing the youthful season of the year.
==109== Some two months hence, up higher toward the north
==110== He first presents his fire, and the high east
==111== Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.

**BRU.**
==112== Give me your hands all over, one by one.

**CAS.**
==113== And let us swear our resolution.

**BRU.**
==114== No, not an oath! If not the face of men,
==115== The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse⁠—
==116== If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
==117== And every man hence to his idle bed;
==118== So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
==119== Till each man drop by lottery. But if these
==120== (As I am sure they do) bear fire enough
==121== To kindle cowards, and to steel with valor
==122== The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
==123== What need we any spur but our own cause
==124== To prick us to redress? What other bond
==125== Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word
==126== And will not palter? And what other oath
==127== Than honesty to honesty engag’d
==128== That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
==129== Swear priests and cowards, and men cautelous,
==130== Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls
==131== That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
==132== Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
==133== The even virtue of our enterprise,
==134== Nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
==135== To think that or our cause or our performance
==136== Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
==137== That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
==138== Is guilty of a several bastardy,
==139== If he do break the smallest particle
==140== Of any promise that hath pass’d from him.

**CAS.**
==141== But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?
==142== I think he will stand very strong with us.

**CASCA.**
==143== Let us not leave him out.

**CIN.**
==143==               No, by no means.

**MET.**
==144== O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
==145== Will purchase us a good opinion,
==146== And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds.
==147== It shall be said his judgment rul’d our hands;
==148== Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
==149== But all be buried in his gravity.

**BRU.**
==150== O, name him not; let us not break with him,
==151== For he will never follow any thing
==152== That other men begin.

**CAS.**
==152==            Then leave him out.

**CASCA.**
==153== Indeed he is not fit.

**DEC.**
==154== Shall no man else be touch’d but only Caesar?

**CAS.**
==155== Decius, well urg’d. I think it is not meet,
==156== Mark Antony, so well belov’d of Caesar,
==157== Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him
==158== A shrewd contriver; and you know, his means,
==159== If he improve them, may well stretch so far
==160== As to annoy us all; which to prevent,
==161== Let Antony and Caesar fall together.

**BRU.**
==162== Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
==163== To cut the head off and then hack the limbs⁠—
==164== Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
==165== For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.
==166== Let’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
==167== We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,
==168== And in the spirit of men there is no blood;
==169== O that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit,
==170== And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
==171== Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
==172== Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
==173== Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
==174== Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;
==175== And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
==176== Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
==177== And after seem to chide ’em. This shall make
==178== Our purpose necessary, and not envious;
==179== Which so appearing to the common eyes,
==180== We shall be call’d purgers, not murderers,
==181== And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
==182== For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm
==183== When Caesar’s head is off.

**CAS.**
==183==               Yet I fear him,
==184== For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar⁠—

**BRU.**
==185== Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.
==186== If he love Caesar, all that he can do
==187== Is to himself—take thought and die for Caesar;
==188== And that were much he should, for he is given
==189== To sports, to wildness, and much company.

**TREB.**
==190== There is no fear in him; let him not die,
==191== For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.

*Clock strikes.*

**BRU.**
==192== Peace, count the clock.

**CAS.**
==192==               The clock hath stricken three.

**TREB.**
==193== ’Tis time to part.

**CAS.**
==193==            But it is doubtful yet
==194== Whether Caesar will come forth today or no;
==195== For he is superstitious grown of late,
==196== Quite from the main opinion he held once
==197== Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.
==198== It may be these apparent prodigies,
==199== The unaccustom’d terror of this night,
==200== And the persuasion of his augurers
==201== May hold him from the Capitol today.

**DEC.**
==202== Never fear that. If he be so resolv’d,
==203== I can o’ersway him; for he loves to hear
==204== That unicorns may be betray’d with trees,
==205== And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
==206== Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;
==207== But when I tell him he hates flatterers
==208== He says he does, being then most flattered.
==209== Let me work;
==210== For I can give his humor the true bent,
==211== And I will bring him to the Capitol.

**CAS.**
==212== Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

**BRU.**
==213== By the eight hour; is that the uttermost?

**CIN.**
==214== Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

**MET.**
==215== Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
==216== Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey;
==217== I wonder none of you have thought of him.

**BRU.**
==218== Now, good Metellus, go along by him.
==219== He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
==220== Send him but hither, and I’ll fashion him.

**CAS.**
==221== The morning comes upon’s. We’ll leave you, Brutus,
==222== And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
==223== What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.

**BRU.**
==224== Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
==225== Let not our looks put on our purposes,
==226== But bear it as our Roman actors do,
==227== With untir’d spirits and formal constancy.
==228== And so good morrow to you every one.
*(Exeunt. Manet Brutus.)*
==229== Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter,
==230== Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber.
==231== Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
==232== Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
==233== Therefore thou sleep’st so sound.

*Enter Portia.*

**POR.**
==233==                   Brutus, my lord!

**BRU.**
==234== Portia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now?
==235== It is not for your health thus to commit
==236== Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.

**POR.**
==237== Nor for yours neither. Y’ have ungently, Brutus,
==238== Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper
==239== You suddenly arose and walk’d about,
==240== Musing and sighing, with your arms across;
==241== And when I ask’d you what the matter was,
==242== You star’d upon me with ungentle looks.
==243== I urg’d you further; then you scratch’d your head,
==244== And too impatiently stamp’d with your foot.
==245== Yet I insisted, yet you answer’d not,
==246== But with an angry wafter of your hand
==247== Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,
==248== Fearing to strengthen that impatience
==249== Which seem’d too much enkindled; and withal
==250== Hoping it was but an effect of humor,
==251== Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
==252== It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep;
==253== And could it work so much upon your shape
==254== As it hath much prevail’d on your condition,
==255== I should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord,
==256== Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

**BRU.**
==257== I am not well in health, and that is all.

**POR.**
==258== Brutus is wise, and were he not in health,
==259== He would embrace the means to come by it.

**BRU.**
==260== Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.

**POR.**
==261== Is Brutus sick? And is it physical
==262== To walk unbraced and suck up the humors
==263== Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick?
==264== And will he steal out of his wholesome bed
==265== To dare the vile contagion of the night,
==266== And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
==267== To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,
==268== You have some sick offense within your mind,
==269== Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
==270== I ought to know of; and upon my knees
==271== I charm you, by my once commended beauty,
==272== By all your vows of love, and that great vow
==273== Which did incorporate and make us one,
==274== That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
==275== Why you are heavy, and what men tonight
==276== Have had resort to you; for here have been
==277== Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
==278== Even from darkness.

**BRU.**
==278==            Kneel not, gentle Portia.

**POR.**
==279== I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
==280== Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
==281== Is it excepted I should know no secrets
==282== That appertain to you? Am I yourself
==283== But, as it were, in sort or limitation.
==284== To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
==285== And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
==286== Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
==287== Portia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife.

**BRU.**
==288== You are my true and honorable wife,
==289== As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
==290== That visit my sad heart.

**POR.**
==291== If this were true, then should I know this secret.
==292== I grant I am a woman; but withal
==293== A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.
==294== I grant I am a woman; but withal
==295== A woman well reputed, Cato’s daughter.
==296== Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
==297== Being so father’d and so husbanded?
==298== Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose ’em.
==299== I have made strong proof of my constancy,
==300== Giving myself a voluntary wound
==301== Here, in the thigh; can I bear that with patience,
==302== And not my husband’s secrets?

**BRU.**
==302==                   O ye gods!
==303== Render me worthy of this noble wife!
*(Knock.)*
==304== Hark, hark, one knocks! Portia, go in a while,
==305== And by and by thy bosom shall partake
==306== The secrets of my heart.
==307== All my engagements I will construe to thee,
==308== All the charactery of my sad brows.
==309== Leave me with haste.
*(Exit Portia.)*
==309==            Lucius, who’s that knocks?

*Enter Lucius and Caius Ligarius.*

**LUC.**
==310== Here is a sick man that would speak with you.

**BRU.**
==311== Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
==312== Boy, stand aside.
*(Exit Lucius.)*
==313== Caius Ligarius, how?

**LIG.**
==314== Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.

**BRU.**
==315== O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
==316== To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!

**LIG.**
==317== I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
==318== Any exploit worthy the name of honor.

**BRU.**
==319== Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
==320== Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

**LIG.**
==321== By all the gods that Romans bow before,
==322== I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
==323== Brave son, deriv’d from honorable loins!
==324== Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjur’d up
==325== My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
==326== And I will strive with things impossible,
==327== Yea, get the better of them. What’s to do?

**BRU.**
==328== A piece of work that will make sick men whole.

**LIG.**
==329== But are not some whole that we must make sick?

**BRU.**
==330== That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
==331== I shall unfold to thee, as we are going,
==332== To whom it must be done.

**LIG.**
==333== Set on your foot,
==334== And with a heart new-fir’d I follow you,
==335== To do I know not what; but it sufficeth
==336== That Brutus leads me on.

*Thunder.*

**BRU.**
==336==               Follow me then.

*Exeunt.*
