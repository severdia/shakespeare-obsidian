## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Inside Brutus’s tent.*

*The scene continues inside Brutus’ tent while Lucilius and Titinius mount guard without.*

**CAS.**
==1==That you have wrong’d me doth appear in this:
==2==You have condemn’d and noted Lucius Pella
==3==For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
==4==Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
==5==Because I knew the man, was slighted off.

**BRU.**
==6==You wrong’d yourself to write in such a case.

**CAS.**
==7==In such a time as this it is not meet
==8==That every nice offense should bear his comment.

**BRU.**
==9==Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
==10==Are much condemn’d to have an itching palm,
==11==To sell and mart your offices for gold
==12==To undeservers.

**CAS.**
==12==           I, an itching palm?
==13==You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,
==14==Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.

**BRU.**
==15==The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
==16==And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.

**CAS.**
==17==Chastisement?

**BRU.**
==18==Remember March, the ides of March remember:
==19==Did not great Julius bleed for justice’ sake?
==20==What villain touch’d his body, that did stab
==21==And not for justice? What? Shall one of us,
==22==That struck the foremost man of all this world
==23==But for supporting robbers, shall we now
==24==Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?
==25==And sell the mighty space of our large honors
==26==For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
==27==I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
==28==Than such a Roman.

**CAS.**
==28==           Brutus, bait not me,
==29==I’ll not endure it. You forget yourself
==30==To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,
==31==Older in practice, abler than yourself
==32==To make conditions.

**BRU.**
==32==           Go to; you are not, Cassius.

**CAS.**
==33==I am.

**BRU.**
==34==I say you are not.

**CAS.**
==35==Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
==36==Have mind upon your health; tempt me no farther.

**BRU.**
==37==Away, slight man!

**CAS.**
==38==Is’t possible?

**BRU.**
==38==        Hear me, for I will speak.
==39==Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
==40==Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

**CAS.**
==41==O ye gods, ye gods, must I endure all this?

**BRU.**
==42==All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break;
==43==Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
==44==And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?
==45==Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
==46==Under your testy humor? By the gods,
==47==You shall digest the venom of your spleen
==48==Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
==49==I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
==50==When you are waspish.

**CAS.**
==50==              Is it come to this?

**BRU.**
==51==You say you are a better soldier:
==52==Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
==53==And it shall please me well. For mine own part,
==54==I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

**CAS.**
==55==You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus:
==56==I said an elder soldier, not a better.
==57==Did I say “better”?

**BRU.**
==57==           If you did, I care not.

**CAS.**
==58==When Caesar liv’d, he durst not thus have mov’d me.

**BRU.**
==59==Peace, peace, you durst not so have tempted him.

**CAS.**
==60==I durst not?

**BRU.**
==61==No.

**CAS.**
==62==What? Durst not tempt him?

**BRU.**
==62==              For your life you durst not.

**CAS.**
==63==Do not presume too much upon my love,
==64==I may do that I shall be sorry for.

**BRU.**
==65==You have done that you should be sorry for.
==66==There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;
==67==For I am arm’d so strong in honesty
==68==That they pass by me as the idle wind,
==69==Which I respect not. I did send to you
==70==For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;
==71==For I can raise no money by vile means.
==72==By heaven, I had rather coin my heart
==73==And drop my blood for drachmaes than to wring
==74==From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
==75==By any indirection. I did send
==76==To you for gold to pay my legions,
==77==Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?
==78==Should I have answer’d Caius Cassius so?
==79==When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
==80==To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
==81==Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
==82==Dash him to pieces!

**CAS.**
==82==           I denied you not.

**BRU.**
==83==You did.

**CAS.**
==84==I did not. He was but a fool that brought
==85==My answer back. Brutus hath riv’d my heart.
==86==A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities;
==87==But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

**BRU.**
==88==I do not, till you practice them on me.

**CAS.**
==89==You love me not.

**BRU.**
==89==           I do not like your faults.

**CAS.**
==90==A friendly eye could never see such faults.

**BRU.**
==91==A flatterer’s would not, though they do appear
==92==As huge as high Olympus.

**CAS.**
==93==Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
==94==Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
==95==For Cassius is a-weary of the world;
==96==Hated by one he loves, brav’d by his brother,
==97==Check’d like a bondman, all his faults observ’d,
==98==Set in a note-book, learn’d, and conn’d by rote,
==99==To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
==100==My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
==101==And here my naked breast; within, a heart
==102==Dearer than Pluto’s mine, richer than gold:
==103==If that thou be’st a Roman, take it forth.
==104==I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
==105==Strike as thou didst at Caesar; for I know,
==106==When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
==107==Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

**BRU.**
==107==                Sheathe your dagger.
==108==Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
==109==Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
==110==O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
==111==That carries anger as the flint bears fire,
==112==Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
==113==And straight is cold again.

**CAS.**
==113==              Hath Cassius liv’d
==114==To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
==115==When grief and blood ill-temper’d vexeth him?

**BRU.**
==116==When I spoke that, I was ill-temper’d too.

**CAS.**
==117==Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.

**BRU.**
==118==And my heart too.

**CAS.**
==118==           O Brutus!

**BRU.**
==118==                What’s the matter?

**CAS.**
==119==Have not you love enough to bear with me,
==120==When that rash humor which my mother gave me
==121==Makes me forgetful?

**BRU.**
==121==           Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,
==122==When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
==123==He’ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

*Enter a Poet to Lucilius and Titinius as they stand on guard.*

**POET.**
==124==Let me go in to see the generals.
==125==There is some grudge between ’em; ’tis not meet
==126==They be alone.

**LUCIL.**
==127==You shall not come to them.

**POET.**
==128==Nothing but death shall stay me.

*Brutus and Cassius step out of the tent.*

**CAS.**
==129==How now? What’s the matter?

**POET.**
==130==For shame, you generals! What do you mean?
==131==Love, and be friends, as two such men should be,
==132==For I have seen more years, I’m sure, than ye.

**CAS.**
==133==Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!

**BRU.**
==134==Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!

**CAS.**
==135==Bear with him, Brutus, ’tis his fashion.

**BRU.**
==136==I’ll know his humor, when he knows his time.
==137==What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
==138==Companion, hence!

**CAS.**
==138==           Away, away, be gone!

*Exit Poet.*

**BRU.**
==139==Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
==140==Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.

**CAS.**
==141==And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
==142==Immediately to us.

*Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.*

**BRU.**
*(To Lucius within.)*
==142==           Lucius, a bowl of wine!

*Brutus and Cassius return into the tent.*

**CAS.**
==143==I did not think you could have been so angry.

**BRU.**
==144==O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

**CAS.**
==145==Of your philosophy you make no use,
==146==If you give place to accidental evils.

**BRU.**
==147==No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.

**CAS.**
==148==Ha? Portia?

**BRU.**
==149==She is dead.

**CAS.**
==150==How scap’d I killing when I cross’d you so?
==151==O insupportable and touching loss!
==152==Upon what sickness?

**BRU.**
==152==              Impatient of my absence,
==153==And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
==154==Have made themselves so strong—for with her death
==155==That tidings came. With this she fell distract,
==156==And (her attendants absent) swallow’d fire.

**CAS.**
==157==And died so?

**BRU.**
==157==        Even so.

**CAS.**
==157==              O ye immortal gods!

*Enter Boy Lucius with wine and tapers.*

**BRU.**
==158==Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
==159==In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

*Drinks.*

**CAS.**
==160==My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
==161==Fill, Lucius, till the wine o’erswell the cup;
==162==I cannot drink too much of Brutus’ love.

*Drinks.*

*Exit Lucius.*

*Enter Titinius and Messala.*

**BRU.**
==163==Come in, Titinius. Welcome, good Messala.
==164==Now sit we close about this taper here,
==165==And call in question our necessities.

**CAS.**
==166==Portia, art thou gone?

**BRU.**
==166==              No more, I pray you.
==167==Messala, I have here received letters
==168==That young Octavius and Mark Antony
==169==Come down upon us with a mighty power,
==170==Bending their expedition toward Philippi.

**MES.**
==171==Myself have letters of the self-same tenure.

**BRU.**
==172==With what addition?

**MES.**
==173==That by proscription and bills of outlawry
==174==Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus
==175==Have put to death an hundred senators.

**BRU.**
==176==Therein our letters do not well agree;
==177==Mine speak of seventy senators that died
==178==By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

**CAS.**
==179==Cicero one?

**MES.**
==179==        Cicero is dead,
==180==And by that order of proscription.
==181==Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?

**BRU.**
==182==No, Messala.

**MES.**
==183==Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

**BRU.**
==184==Nothing, Messala.

**MES.**
==184==           That, methinks, is strange.

**BRU.**
==185==Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?

**MES.**
==186==No, my lord.

**BRU.**
==187==Now as you are a Roman tell me true.

**MES.**
==188==Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
==189==For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.

**BRU.**
==190==Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.
==191==With meditating that she must die once,
==192==I have the patience to endure it now.

**MES.**
==193==Even so great men great losses should endure.

**CAS.**
==194==I have as much of this in art as you,
==195==But yet my nature could not bear it so.

**BRU.**
==196==Well, to our work alive. What do you think
==197==Of marching to Philippi presently?

**CAS.**
==198==I do not think it good.

**BRU.**
==198==           Your reason?

**CAS.**
==198==                  This it is:
==199==’Tis better that the enemy seek us;
==200==So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
==201==Doing himself offense, whilst we, lying still,
==202==Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.

**BRU.**
==203==Good reasons must of force give place to better:
==204==The people ’twixt Philippi and this ground
==205==Do stand but in a forc’d affection,
==206==For they have grudg’d us contribution.
==207==The enemy, marching along by them,
==208==By them shall make a fuller number up,
==209==Come on refresh’d, new-added, and encourag’d;
==210==From which advantage shall we cut him off
==211==If at Philippi we do face him there,
==212==These people at our back.

**CAS.**
==212==              Hear me, good brother.

**BRU.**
==213==Under your pardon. You must note beside
==214==That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
==215==Our legions are brimful, our cause is ripe:
==216==The enemy increaseth every day;
==217==We, at the height, are ready to decline.
==218==There is a tide in the affairs of men,
==219==Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
==220==Omitted, all the voyage of their life
==221==Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
==222==On such a full sea are we now afloat,
==223==And we must take the current when it serves,
==224==Or lose our ventures.

**CAS.**
==224==           Then with your will go on;
==225==We’ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi .

**BRU.**
==226==The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
==227==And nature must obey necessity,
==228==Which we will niggard with a little rest.
==229==There is no more to say?

**CAS.**
==229==              No more. Good night.
==230==Early tomorrow will we rise, and hence.

**BRU.**
==231==Lucius!
*(Enter Lucius.)*
==231==    My gown.
*(Exit Lucius.)*
==231==              Farewell, good Messala.
==232==Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
==233==Good night, and good repose.

**CAS.**
==233==                O my dear brother!
==234==This was an ill beginning of the night.
==235==Never come such division ’tween our souls!
==236==Let it not, Brutus.

*Enter Lucius with the gown.*

**BRU.**
==236==           Every thing is well.

**CAS.**
==237==Good night, my lord.

**BRU.**
==237==           Good night, good brother.

**BOTH TIT. AND MES.**
==238==Good night, Lord Brutus.

**BRU.**
==238==              Farewell every one.
*(Exeunt all but Brutus and Lucius.)*
==239==Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?

**LUC.**
==240==Here in the tent.

**BRU.**
==240==        What, thou speak’st drowsily?
==241==Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o’erwatch’d.
==242==Call Claudio and some other of my men,
==243==I’ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

**LUC.**
==244==Varrus and Claudio!

*Enter Varrus and Claudio.*

**VAR.**
==245==Calls my lord?

**BRU.**
==246==I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
==247==It may be I shall raise you by and by
==248==On business to my brother Cassius.

**VAR.**
==249==So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.

**BRU.**
==250==I will not have it so. Lie down, good sirs,
==251==It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
*(Varrus and Claudio lie down.)*
==252==Look, Lucius, here’s the book I sought for so;
==253==I put it in the pocket of my gown.

**LUC.**
==254==I was sure your lordship did not give it me.

**BRU.**
==255==Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
==256==Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
==257==And touch thy instrument a strain or two?

**LUC.**
==258==Ay, my lord, an’t please you.

**BRU.**
==258==                It does, my boy.
==259==I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

**LUC.**
==260==It is my duty, sir.

**BRU.**
==261==I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
==262==I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

**LUC.**
==263==I have slept, my lord, already.

**BRU.**
==264==It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;
==265==I will not hold thee long. If I do live,
==266==I will be good to thee.
*(Music, and a song.)*
==267==This is a sleepy tune. O murd’rous slumber!
==268==Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
==269==That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
==270==I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.
==271==If thou dost nod, thou break’st thy instrument,
==272==I’ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
==273==Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn’d down
==274==Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
*(Enter the Ghost of Caesar.)*
==275==How ill this taper burns! Ha! Who comes here?
==276==I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
==277==That shapes this monstrous apparition.
==278==It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
==279==Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
==280==That mak’st my blood cold, and my hair to stare?
==281==Speak to me what thou art.

**GHOST.**
==282==Thy evil spirit, Brutus.

**BRU.**
==282==              Why com’st thou?

**GHOST.**
==283==To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

**BRU.**
==284==Well; then I shall see thee again?

**GHOST.**
==285==Ay, at Philippi.

**BRU.**
==286==Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.
*(Exit Ghost.)*
==287==Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.
==288==Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
==289==Boy, Lucius! Varrus! Claudio! Sirs, awake!
==290==Claudio!

**LUC.**
==291==The strings, my lord, are false.

**BRU.**
==292==He thinks he still is at his instrument.
==293==Lucius, awake!

**LUC.**
==294==My lord?

**BRU.**
==295==Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

**LUC.**
==296==My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

**BRU.**
==297==Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see any thing?

**LUC.**
==298==Nothing, my lord.

**BRU.**
==299==Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!
*(To Varrus.)*
==300==Fellow thou, awake!

**VAR.**
==301==My lord?

**CLAU.**
==302==My lord?

**BRU.**
==303==Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

**BOTH VAR. AND CLAU.**
==304==Did we, my lord?

**BRU.**
==304==           Ay. Saw you any thing?

**VAR.**
==305==No, my lord, I saw nothing.

**CLAU.**
==305==              Nor I, my lord.

**BRU.**
==306==Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
==307==Bid him set on his pow’rs betimes before,
==308==And we will follow.

**BOTH VAR. AND CLAU.**
==308==           It shall be done, my lord.

*Exeunt.*
