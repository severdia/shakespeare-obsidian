## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Rome. A street near the capitol.*

*Enter Artemidorus reading a paper.*

**ART.**
==1== *“Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius; mark well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast wrong’d Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal, look about you; security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover, Artemidorus.”*
==2== Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
==3== And as a suitor will I give him this.
==4== My heart laments that virtue cannot live
==5== Out of the teeth of emulation.
==6== If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;
==7== If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

*Exit.*
