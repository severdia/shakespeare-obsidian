## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*The plains of Philippi.*

*Enter Octavius, Antony, and their army.*

**OCT.**
==1== Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.
==2== You said the enemy would not come down,
==3== But keep the hills and upper regions.
==4== It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
==5== They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
==6== Answering before we do demand of them.

**ANT.**
==7== Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
==8== Wherefore they do it. They could be content
==9== To visit other places, and come down
==10== With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
==11== To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
==12== But ’tis not so.

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
==12==         Prepare you, generals.
==13== The enemy comes on in gallant show;
==14== Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
==15== And something to be done immediately.

**ANT.**
==16== Octavius, lead your battle softly on
==17== Upon the left hand of the even field.

**OCT.**
==18== Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.

**ANT.**
==19== Why do you cross me in this exigent?

**OCT.**
==20== I do not cross you; but I will do so.

*March.*

*Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their army; Lucilius, Titinius, Messala, and others.*

**BRU.**
==21== They stand, and would have parley.

**CAS.**
==22== Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.

**OCT.**
==23== Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?

**ANT.**
==24== No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
==25== Make forth, the generals would have some words.

**OCT.**
==26== Stir not until the signal.

**BRU.**
==27== Words before blows; is it so, countrymen?

**OCT.**
==28== Not that we love words better, as you do.

**BRU.**
==29== Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.

**ANT.**
==30== In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words;
==31== Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart,
==32== Crying, “Long live! Hail, Caesar!”

**CAS.**
==32==                   Antony,
==33== The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
==34== But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
==35== And leave them honeyless.

**ANT.**
==35==               Not stingless too?

**BRU.**
==36== O yes, and soundless too;
==37== For you have stol’n their buzzing, Antony,
==38== And very wisely threat before you sting.

**ANT.**
==39== Villains! You did not so, when your vile daggers
==40== Hack’d one another in the sides of Caesar.
==41== You show’d your teeth like apes, and fawn’d like hounds,
==42== And bow’d like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet;
==43== Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
==44== Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!

**CAS.**
==45== Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself;
==46== This tongue had not offended so today,
==47== If Cassius might have rul’d.

**OCT.**
==48== Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,
==49== The proof of it will turn to redder drops.
==50== Look,
==51== I draw a sword against conspirators;
==52== When think you that the sword goes up again?
==53== Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds
==54== Be well aveng’d; or till another Caesar
==55== Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.

**BRU.**
==56== Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands,
==57== Unless thou bring’st them with thee.

**OCT.**
==57==                   So I hope;
==58== I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword.

**BRU.**
==59== O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
==60== Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.

**CAS.**
==61== A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor,
==62== Join’d with a masker and a reveller!

**ANT.**
==63== Old Cassius still!

**OCT.**
==63==            Come, Antony; away!
==64== Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.
==65== If you dare fight today, come to the field;
==66== If not, when you have stomachs.

*Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and army.*

**CAS.**
==67== Why now blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!
==68== The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.

**BRU.**
==69== Ho, Lucilius, hark, a word with you.

*Lucilius and then Messala stand forth.*

**LUCIL.**
==70== My lord.

*Brutus and Lucilius converse apart.*

**CAS.**
==71== Messala!

**MES.**
==71==     What says my general?

**CAS.**
==71==                   Messala,
==72== This is my birthday; as this very day
==73== Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.
==74== Be thou my witness that against my will
==75== (As Pompey was) am I compell’d to set
==76== Upon one battle all our liberties.
==77== You know that I held Epicurus strong,
==78== And his opinion; now I change my mind,
==79== And partly credit things that do presage.
==80== Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
==81== Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch’d,
==82== Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands,
==83== Who to Philippi here consorted us.
==84== This morning are they fled away and gone,
==85== And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites
==86== Fly o’er our heads, and downward look on us
==87== As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem
==88== A canopy most fatal, under which
==89== Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.

**MES.**
==90== Believe not so.

**CAS.**
==90==         I but believe it partly,
==91== For I am fresh of spirit, and resolv’d
==92== To meet all perils very constantly.

**BRU.**
==93== Even so, Lucilius.

**CAS.**
==93==            Now, most noble Brutus,
==94== The gods today stand friendly, that we may,
==95== Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
==96== But since the affairs of men rests still incertain,
==97== Let’s reason with the worst that may befall.
==98== If we do lose this battle, then is this
==99== The very last time we shall speak together:
==100== What are you then determined to do?

**BRU.**
==101== Even by the rule of that philosophy
==102== By which I did blame Cato for the death
==103== Which he did give himself—I know not how,
==104== But I do find it cowardly and vile,
==105== For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
==106== The time of life—arming myself with patience
==107== To stay the providence of some high powers
==108== That govern us below.

**CAS.**
==108==            Then, if we lose this battle,
==109== You are contented to be led in triumph
==110== Thorough the streets of Rome?

**BRU.**
==111== No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou Roman,
==112== That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
==113== He bears too great a mind. But this same day
==114== Must end that work the ides of March begun.
==115== And whether we shall meet again I know not;
==116== Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
==117== For ever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!
==118== If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
==119== If not, why then this parting was well made.

**CAS.**
==120== For ever, and forever, farewell, Brutus!
==121== If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed;
==122== If not, ’tis true this parting was well made.

**BRU.**
==123== Why then lead on. O that a man might know
==124== The end of this day’s business ere it come!
==125== But it sufficeth that the day will end,
==126== And then the end is known. Come ho, away!

*Exeunt.*
