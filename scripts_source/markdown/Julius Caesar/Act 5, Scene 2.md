[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The plains of Philippi. The battlefield.*

*Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.*

**BRU.**
==1==Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
==2==Unto the legions on the other side.
*(Loud alarum.)*
==3==Let them set on at once; for I perceive
==4==But cold demeanor in Octavio’s wing,
==5==And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
==6==Ride, ride, Messala, let them all come down.

*Exeunt.*
