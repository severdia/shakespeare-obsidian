## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*The plains of Philippi. Another part of the battlefield.*

*Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, young Cato, Lucilius, and Flavius.*

**BRU.**
==1==Yet, countrymen! O yet, hold up your heads!

*Exit.*

**CATO.**
==2==What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
==3==I will proclaim my name about the field.
==4==I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
==5==A foe to tyrants, and my country’s friend.
==6==I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!

*Enter Antony’s Soldiers and fight.*

**LUCIL.**
==7==And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I,
==8==Brutus, my country’s friend; know me for Brutus!
*(Young Cato is slain.)*
==9==O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
==10==Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,
==11==And mayst be honor’d, being Cato’s son.

**1. ANT. SOLD.**
==12==Yield, or thou diest.

**LUCIL.**
==12==           Only I yield to die;
==13==There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight:
==14==Kill Brutus, and be honor’d in his death.

**1. ANT. SOLD.**
==15==We must not. A noble prisoner!

*Enter Antony.*

**2. ANT. SOLD.**
==16==Room ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta’en.

**1. ANT. SOLD.**
==17==I’ll tell the news. Here comes the general.
==18==Brutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord!

**ANT.**
==19==Where is he?

**LUCIL.**
==20==Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.
==21==I dare assure thee that no enemy
==22==Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;
==23==The gods defend him from so great a shame!
==24==When you do find him, or alive or dead,
==25==He will be found like Brutus, like himself.

**ANT.**
==26==This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,
==27==A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,
==28==Give him all kindness; I had rather have
==29==Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
==30==And see whe’er Brutus be alive or dead,
==31==And bring us word unto Octavius’ tent
==32==How every thing is chanc’d.

*Exeunt.*
