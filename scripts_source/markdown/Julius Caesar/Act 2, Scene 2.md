## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Rome. Caesar’s house.*

*Thunder and lightning.*

*Enter Julius Caesar in his night-gown.*

**CAES.**
==1== Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.
==2== Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out,
==3== “Help, ho! They murder Caesar!” Who’s within?

*Enter a Servant.*

**CAES. SERV.**
==4== My lord?

**CAES.**
==5== Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,
==6== And bring me their opinions of success.

**CAES. SERV.**
==7== I will, my lord.

*Exit.*

*Enter Calphurnia.*

**CAL.**
==8== What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?
==9== You shall not stir out of your house today.

**CAES.**
==10== Caesar shall forth; the things that threaten’d me
==11== Ne’er look’d but on my back; when they shall see
==12== The face of Caesar, they are vanished.

**CAL.**
==13== Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
==14== Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
==15== Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
==16== Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
==17== A lioness hath whelped in the streets,
==18== And graves have yawn’d and yielded up their dead;
==19== Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds
==20== In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
==21== Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
==22== The noise of battle hurtled in the air;
==23== Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
==24== And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
==25== O Caesar, these things are beyond all use,
==26== And I do fear them.

**CAES.**
==26==            What can be avoided
==27== Whose end is purpos’d by the mighty gods?
==28== Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
==29== Are to the world in general as to Caesar.

**CAL.**
==30== When beggars die there are no comets seen;
==31== The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

**CAES.**
==32== Cowards die many times before their deaths,
==33== The valiant never taste of death but once.
==34== Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
==35== It seems to me most strange that men should fear,
==36== Seeing that death, a necessary end,
==37== Will come when it will come.
*(Enter a Servant.)*
==37==               What say the augurers?

**CAES. SERV.**
==38== They would not have you to stir forth today.
==39== Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
==40== They could not find a heart within the beast.

**CAES.**
==41== The gods do this in shame of cowardice;
==42== Caesar should be a beast without a heart
==43== If he should stay at home today for fear.
==44== No, Caesar shall not; Danger knows full well
==45== That Caesar is more dangerous than he.
==46== We are two lions litter’d in one day,
==47== And I the elder and more terrible;
==48== And Caesar shall go forth.

**CAL.**
==48==               Alas, my lord,
==49== Your wisdom is consum’d in confidence.
==50== Do not go forth today; call it my fear
==51== That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
==52== We’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate-house,
==53== And he shall say you are not well today.
==54== Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

**CAES.**
==55== Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
==56== And for thy humor I will stay at home.
*(Enter Decius.)*
==57== Here’s Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.

**DEC.**
==58== Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar,
==59== I come to fetch you to the Senate-house.

**CAES.**
==60== And you are come in very happy time
==61== To bear my greeting to the senators,
==62== And tell them that I will not come today.
==63== Cannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser:
==64== I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.

**CAL.**
==65== Say he is sick.

**CAES.**
==65==         Shall Caesar send a lie?
==66== Have I in conquest stretch’d mine arm so far,
==67== To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?
==68== Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.

**DEC.**
==69== Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
==70== Lest I be laugh’d at when I tell them so.

**CAES.**
==71== The cause is in my will, I will not come:
==72== That is enough to satisfy the Senate.
==73== But for your private satisfaction,
==74== Because I love you, I will let you know.
==75== Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
==76== She dreamt tonight she saw my statuë,
==77== Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
==78== Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans
==79== Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.
==80== And these does she apply for warnings and portents
==81== And evils imminent, and on her knee
==82== Hath begg’d that I will stay at home today.

**DEC.**
==83== This dream is all amiss interpreted,
==84== It was a vision fair and fortunate.
==85== Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
==86== In which so many smiling Romans bath’d,
==87== Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
==88== Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
==89== For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.
==90== This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified.

**CAES.**
==91== And this way have you well expounded it.

**DEC.**
==92== I have, when you have heard what I can say;
==93== And know it now: the Senate have concluded
==94== To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
==95== If you shall send them word you will not come,
==96== Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
==97== Apt to be render’d, for some one to say,
==98== “Break up the Senate till another time,
==99== When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.”
==100== If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper,
==101== “Lo Caesar is afraid”?
==102== Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love
==103== To your proceeding bids me tell you this;
==104== And reason to my love is liable.

**CAES.**
==105== How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia!
==106== I am ashamed I did yield to them.
==107== Give me my robe, for I will go.
*(Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius, Cinna, and Publius.)*
==108== And look where Publius is come to fetch me.

**PUB.**
==109== Good morrow, Caesar.

**CAES.**
==109==               Welcome, Publius.
==110== What, Brutus, are you stirr’d so early too?
==111== Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
==112== Caesar was ne’er so much your enemy
==113== As that same ague which hath made you lean.
==114== What is’t a’ clock?

**BRU.**
==114==            Caesar, ’tis strucken eight.

**CAES.**
==115== I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
*(Enter Antony.)*
==116== See, Antony, that revels long a-nights,
==117== Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.

**ANT.**
==118== So to most noble Caesar.

**CAES.**
==119== Bid them prepare within;
==120== I am to blame to be thus waited for.
==121== Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius:
==122== I have an hour’s talk in store for you;
==123== Remember that you call on me today;
==124== Be near me, that I may remember you.

**TREB.**
==125== Caesar, I will;
*(Aside.)*
==126== And so near will I be,
==127== That your best friends shall wish I had been further.

**CAES.**
==128== Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me,
==129== And we, like friends, will straightway go together.

**BRU.**
*(Aside.)*
==130== That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
==131== The heart of Brutus earns to think upon!

*Exeunt.*
