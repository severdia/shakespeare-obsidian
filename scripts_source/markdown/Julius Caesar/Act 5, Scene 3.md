## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The plains of Philippi. Another part of the battlefield.*

*Alarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius.*

**CAS.**
==1== O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
==2== Myself have to mine own turn’d enemy.
==3== This ensign here of mine was turning back;
==4== I slew the coward, and did take it from him.

**TIT.**
==5== O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,
==6== Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
==7== Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,
==8== Whilst we by Antony are all enclos’d.

*Enter Pindarus.*

**PIN.**
==9== Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
==10== Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;
==11== Fly therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.

**CAS.**
==12== This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius,
==13== Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?

**TIT.**
==14== They are, my lord.

**CAS.**
==14==            Titinius, if thou lovest me,
==15== Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him
==16== Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops
==17== And here again, that I may rest assur’d
==18== Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.

**TIT.**
==19== I will be here again, even with a thought.

*Exit.*

**CAS.**
==20== Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
==21== My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
==22== And tell me what thou not’st about the field.
*(Pindarus goes up.)*
==23== This day I breathed first: time is come round,
==24== And where I did begin, there shall I end;
==25== My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?

**PIN.**
*(Above.)*
==26== O my lord!

**CAS.**
==27== What news?

**PIN.**
==28== Titinius is enclosed round about
==29== With horsemen, that make to him on the spur,
==30== Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
==31== Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
==32== He’s ta’en.
*(Shout.)*
==33== And hark, they shout for joy.

**CAS.**
==34== Come down, behold no more.
==35== O, coward that I am, to live so long,
==36== To see my best friend ta’en before my face!
*(Pindarus descends.)*
==37== Come hither, sirrah.
==38== In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,
==39== And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
==40== That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
==41== Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
==42== Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,
==43== That ran through Caesar’s bowels, search this bosom.
==44== Stand not to answer; here, take thou the hilts,
==45== And when my face is cover’d, as ’tis now,
==46== Guide thou the sword.
*(Pindarus stabs him.)*
==47== Caesar, thou art reveng’d,
==48== Even with the sword that kill’d thee.

*Dies.*

**PIN.**
==49== So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
==50== Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
==51== Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
==52== Where never Roman shall take note of him.

*Exit.*

*Enter Titinius and Messala.*

**MES.**
==53== It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
==54== Is overthrown by noble Brutus’ power,
==55== As Cassius’ legions are by Antony.

**TIT.**
==56== These tidings will well comfort Cassius.

**MES.**
==57== Where did you leave him?

**TIT.**
==57==               All disconsolate,
==58== With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.

**MES.**
==59== Is not that he that lies upon the ground?

**TIT.**
==60== He lies not like the living. O my heart!

**MES.**
==61== Is not that he?

**TIT.**
==61==         No, this was he, Messala,
==62== But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
==63== As in thy red rays thou dost sink tonight,
==64== So in his red blood Cassius’ day is set!
==65== The sun of Rome is set. Our day is gone,
==66== Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
==67== Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.

**MES.**
==68== Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
==69== O hateful error, melancholy’s child,
==70== Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
==71== The things that are not? O error, soon conceiv’d,
==72== Thou never com’st unto a happy birth,
==73== But kill’st the mother that engend’red thee!

**TIT.**
==74== What, Pindarus? Where art thou, Pindarus?

**MES.**
==75== Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
==76== The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
==77== Into his ears; I may say “thrusting” it;
==78== For piercing steel, and darts envenomed,
==79== Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
==80== As tidings of this sight.

**TIT.**
==80==               Hie you, Messala,
==81== And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
*(Exit Messala.)*
==82== Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
==83== Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they
==84== Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
==85== And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
==86== Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing.
==87== But hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
==88== Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
==89== Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
==90== And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
==91== By your leave, gods!—this is a Roman’s part.
==92== Come, Cassius’ sword, and find Titinius’ heart.

*Dies.*

*Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, young Cato, Strato, Volumnius, and Lucilius.*

**BRU.**
==93== Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?

**MES.**
==94== Lo yonder, and Titinius mourning it.

**BRU.**
==95== Titinius’ face is upward.

**CATO.**
==95==               He is slain.

**BRU.**
==96== O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
==97== Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords
==98== In our own proper entrails.

*Low alarums.*

**CATO.**
==98==                 Brave Titinius!
==99== Look whe’er he have not crown’d dead Cassius!

**BRU.**
==100== Are yet two Romans living such as these?
==101== The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
==102== It is impossible that ever Rome
==103== Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
==104== To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
==105== I shall find time, Cassius; I shall find time.
==106== Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;
==107== His funerals shall not be in our camp,
==108== Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come,
==109== And come, young Cato, let us to the field,
==110== Labio and Flavio set our battles on.
==111== ’Tis three a’ clock, and, Romans, yet ere night
==112== We shall try fortune in a second fight.

*Exeunt.*
