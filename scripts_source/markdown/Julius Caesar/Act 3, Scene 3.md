## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. A street.*

*Enter Cinna the poet, and after him the Plebeians.*

**CIN. POET.**
I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
And things unluckily charge my fantasy.
I have no will to wander forth of doors,
Yet something leads me forth.

**1. PLEB.**
What is your name?

**2. PLEB.**
Whither are you going?

**3. PLEB.**
Where do you dwell?

**4. PLEB.**
Are you a married man or a bachelor?

**2. PLEB.**
Answer every man directly.

**1. PLEB.**
Ay, and briefly.

**4. PLEB.**
Ay, and wisely.

**3. PLEB.**
Ay, and truly, you were best.

**CIN. POET.**
What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely, I say, I am a bachelor.

**2. PLEB.**
That’s as much as to say, they are fools that marry. You’ll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly.

**CIN. POET.**
Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.

**1. PLEB.**
As a friend or an enemy?

**CIN. POET.**
As a friend.

**2. PLEB.**
That matter is answer’d directly.

**4. PLEB.**
For your dwelling—briefly.

**CIN. POET.**
Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.

**3. PLEB.**
Your name, sir, truly.

**CIN. POET.**
Truly, my name is Cinna.

**1. PLEB.**
Tear him to pieces, he’s a conspirator.

**CIN. POET.**
I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.

**4. PLEB.**
Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.

**CIN. POET.**
I am not Cinna the conspirator.

**4. PLEB.**
It is no matter, his name’s Cinna. Pluck but his name out of his heart, and turn him going.

**3. PLEB.**
Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho, fire-brands! To Brutus’, to Cassius’; burn all! Some to Decius’ house, and some to Casca’s; some to Ligarius’. Away, go!

*Exeunt all the Plebeians dragging off Cinna.*
