## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. A street.*

*Enter Cinna the poet, and after him the Plebeians.*

**CIN. POET.**
==1==I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,
==2==And things unluckily charge my fantasy.
==3==I have no will to wander forth of doors,
==4==Yet something leads me forth.

**1. PLEB.**
==5==What is your name?

**2. PLEB.**
==6==Whither are you going?

**3. PLEB.**
==7==Where do you dwell?

**4. PLEB.**
==8==Are you a married man or a bachelor?

**2. PLEB.**
==9==Answer every man directly.

**1. PLEB.**
==10==Ay, and briefly.

**4. PLEB.**
==11==Ay, and wisely.

**3. PLEB.**
==12==Ay, and truly, you were best.

**CIN. POET.**
==13==What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely, I say, I am a bachelor.

**2. PLEB.**
==14==That’s as much as to say, they are fools that marry. You’ll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly.

**CIN. POET.**
==15==Directly, I am going to Caesar’s funeral.

**1. PLEB.**
==16==As a friend or an enemy?

**CIN. POET.**
==17==As a friend.

**2. PLEB.**
==18==That matter is answer’d directly.

**4. PLEB.**
==19==For your dwelling—briefly.

**CIN. POET.**
==20==Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.

**3. PLEB.**
==21==Your name, sir, truly.

**CIN. POET.**
==22==Truly, my name is Cinna.

**1. PLEB.**
==23==Tear him to pieces, he’s a conspirator.

**CIN. POET.**
==24==I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.

**4. PLEB.**
==25==Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.

**CIN. POET.**
==26==I am not Cinna the conspirator.

**4. PLEB.**
==27==It is no matter, his name’s Cinna. Pluck but his name out of his heart, and turn him going.

**3. PLEB.**
==28==Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho, fire-brands! To Brutus’, to Cassius’; burn all! Some to Decius’ house, and some to Casca’s; some to Ligarius’. Away, go!

*Exeunt all the Plebeians dragging off Cinna.*
