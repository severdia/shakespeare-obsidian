## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. A street.*

*Enter Flavius, Murellus, and certain Commoners over the stage.*

**FLAV.**
==1==Hence! Home, you idle creatures, get you home!
==2==Is this a holiday? What, know you not,
==3==Being mechanical, you ought not walk
==4==Upon a laboring day without the sign
==5==Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?

**CAR.**
==6==Why, sir, a carpenter.

**MUR.**
==7==Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
==8==What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
==9==You, sir, what trade are you?

**COB.**
==10==Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, as you would say, a cobbler.

**MUR.**
==11==But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.

**COB.**
==12==A trade, sir, that I hope I may use with a safe conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.

**FLAV.**
==13==What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what trade?

**COB.**
==14==Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me; yet if you be out, sir, I can mend you.

**MUR.**
==15==What mean’st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy fellow?

**COB.**
==16==Why, sir, cobble you.

**FLAV.**
==17==Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

**COB.**
==18==Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I meddle with no tradesman’s matters, nor women’s matters; but withal I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon neat’s-leather have gone upon my handiwork.

**FLAV.**
==19==But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
==20==Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?

**COB.**
==21==Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see Caesar, and to rejoice in his triumph.

**MUR.**
==22==Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
==23==What tributaries follow him to Rome,
==24==To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
==25==You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
==26==O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
==27==Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
==28==Have you climb’d up to walls and battlements,
==29==To tow’rs and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
==30==Your infants in your arms, and there have sate
==31==The livelong day, with patient expectation,
==32==To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome;
==33==And when you saw his chariot but appear,
==34==Have you not made an universal shout,
==35==That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
==36==To hear the replication of your sounds
==37==Made in her concave shores?
==38==And do you now put on your best attire?
==39==And do you now cull out a holiday?
==40==And do you now strew flowers in his way,
==41==That comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood?
==42==Be gone!
==43==Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
==44==Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
==45==That needs must light on this ingratitude.

**FLAV.**
==46==Go, go, good countrymen, and for this fault
==47==Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
==48==Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
==49==Into the channel, till the lowest stream
==50==Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
*(Exeunt all the Commoners.)*
==51==See whe’er their basest metal be not mov’d;
==52==They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
==53==Go you down that way towards the Capitol,
==54==This way will I. Disrobe the images,
==55==If you do find them deck’d with ceremonies.

**MUR.**
==56==May we do so?
==57==You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

**FLAV.**
==58==It is no matter, let no images
==59==Be hung with Caesar’s trophies, I’ll about,
==60==And drive away the vulgar from the streets;
==61==So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
==62==These growing feathers pluck’d from Caesar’s wing
==63==Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
==64==Who else would soar above the view of men,
==65==And keep us all in servile tearfulness.

*Exeunt.*
