## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. Before the capitol; the Senate sitting above.*

*Flourish. Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna, Antony, Lepidus, Artemidorus, Publius, Popilius, and the Soothsayer.*

**CAES.**
==1==The Ides of March are come.

**SOOTH.**
==2==Ay, Caesar, but not gone.

**ART.**
==3==Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.

**DEC.**
==4==Trebonius doth desire you to o’er-read
==5==(At your best leisure) this his humble suit.

**ART.**
==6==O Caesar, read mine first; for mine’s a suit
==7==That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.

**CAES.**
==8==What touches us ourself shall be last serv’d.

**ART.**
==9==Delay not, Caesar, read it instantly.

**CAES.**
==10==What, is the fellow mad?

**PUB.**
==10==              Sirrah, give place.

**CAS.**
==11==What, urge you your petitions in the street?
==12==Come to the Capitol.

*Caesar enters the Capitol, the rest following.*

**POP.**
==13==I wish your enterprise today may thrive.

**CAS.**
==14==What enterprise, Popilius?

**POP.**
==14==              Fare you well.

*Leaves him and joins Caesar.*

**BRU.**
==15==What said Popilius Lena?

**CAS.**
==16==He wish’d today our enterprise might thrive.
==17==I fear our purpose is discovered.

**BRU.**
==18==Look how he makes to Caesar; mark him.

**CAS.**
==19==Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
==20==Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
==21==Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
==22==For I will slay myself.

**BRU.**
==22==           Cassius, be constant;
==23==Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes,
==24==For look he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.

**CAS.**
==25==Trebonius knows his time; for look you, Brutus,
==26==He draws Mark Antony out of the way.

*Exeunt Antony and Trebonius.*

**DEC.**
==27==Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go
==28==And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.

**BRU.**
==29==He is address’d; press near and second him.

**CIN.**
==30==Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.

**CAES.**
==31==Are we all ready? What is now amiss
==32==That Caesar and his Senate must redress?

**MET.**
==33==Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
==34==Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
==35==An humble heart.

*Kneeling.*

**CAES.**
==35==           I must prevent thee, Cimber.
==36==These couchings and these lowly courtesies
==37==Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
==38==And turn preordinance and first decree
==39==Into the law of children. Be not fond
==40==To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
==41==That will be thaw’d from the true quality
==42==With that which melteth fools—I mean sweet words,
==43==Low-crooked curtsies, and base spaniel fawning.
==44==Thy brother by decree is banished;
==45==If thou dost bend, and pray, and fawn for him,
==46==I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
==47==Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
==48==Will he be satisfied.

**MET.**
==49==Is there no voice more worthy than my own,
==50==To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear
==51==For the repealing of my banish’d brother?

**BRU.**
==52==I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
==53==Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
==54==Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

**CAES.**
==55==What, Brutus?

**CAS.**
==55==        Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!
==56==As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
==57==To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

**CAES.**
==58==I could be well mov’d, if I were as you;
==59==If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;
==60==But I am constant as the northern star,
==61==Of whose true-fix’d and resting quality
==62==There is no fellow in the firmament.
==63==The skies are painted with unnumb’red sparks,
==64==They are all fire, and every one doth shine;
==65==But there’s but one in all doth hold his place.
==66==So in the world: ’tis furnish’d well with men,
==67==And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
==68==Yet in the number I do know but one
==69==That unassailable holds on his rank,
==70==Unshak’d of motion; and that I am he,
==71==Let me a little show it, even in this⁠—
==72==That I was constant Cimber should be banish’d,
==73==And constant do remain to keep him so.

**CIN.**
==74==O Caesar⁠—

**CAES.**
==74==        Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?

**DEC.**
==75==Great Caesar⁠—

**CAES.**
==75==        Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

**CASCA.**
==76==Speak hands for me!

*They stab Caesar.*

**CAES.**
==77==*Et tu, Brute?*—Then fall Caesar!

*Dies.*

**CIN.**
==78==Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
==79==Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.

**CAS.**
==80==Some to the common pulpits, and cry out,
==81==“Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!”

**BRU.**
==82==People and senators, be not affrighted;
==83==Fly not, stand still; ambition’s debt is paid.

**CASCA.**
==84==Go to the pulpit, Brutus.

**DEC.**
==84==              And Cassius too.

**BRU.**
==85==Where’s Publius?

**CIN.**
==86==Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

**MET.**
==87==Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s
==88==Should chance⁠—

**BRU.**
==89==Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,
==90==There is no harm intended to your person,
==91==Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.

**CAS.**
==92==And leave us, Publius, lest that the people,
==93==Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.

**BRU.**
==94==Do so, and let no man abide this deed,
==95==But we the doers.

*Exeunt all but the Conspirators.*

*Enter Trebonius.*

**CAS.**
==96==Where is Antony?

**TREB.**
==96==           Fled to his house amaz’d.
==97==Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run,
==98==As it were doomsday.

**BRU.**
==98==           Fates, we will know your pleasures.
==99==That we shall die, we know, ’tis but the time,
==100==And drawing days out, that men stand upon.

**CASCA.**
==101==Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
==102==Cuts off so many years of fearing death.

**BRU.**
==103==Grant that, and then is death a benefit;
==104==So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridg’d
==105==His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
==106==And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood
==107==Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;
==108==Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
==109==And waving our red weapons o’er our heads,
==110==Let’s all cry, “Peace, freedom, and liberty!”

**CAS.**
==111==Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence
==112==Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
==113==In states unborn and accents yet unknown!

**BRU.**
==114==How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
==115==That now on Pompey’s basis lies along
==116==No worthier than the dust!

**CAS.**
==116==              So oft as that shall be,
==117==So often shall the knot of us be call’d
==118==The men that gave their country liberty.

**DEC.**
==119==What, shall we forth?

**CAS.**
==119==           Ay, every man away.
==120==Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels
==121==With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

*Enter a Servant.*

**BRU.**
==122==Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s.

**CAES. SERV.**
==123==Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel;
==124==Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
==125==And being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
==126==Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
==127==Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.
==128==Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him;
==129==Say, I fear’d Caesar, honor’d him, and lov’d him.
==130==If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
==131==May safely come to him, and be resolv’d
==132==How Caesar hath deserv’d to lie in death,
==133==Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
==134==So well as Brutus living; but will follow
==135==The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
==136==Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
==137==With all true faith. So says my master Antony.

**BRU.**
==138==Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman,
==139==I never thought him worse.
==140==Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
==141==He shall be satisfied; and, by my honor,
==142==Depart untouch’d.

**CAES. SERV.**
==142==           I’ll fetch him presently.

*Exit Servant.*

**BRU.**
==143==I know that we shall have him well to friend.

**CAS.**
==144==I wish we may; but yet have I a mind
==145==That fears him much; and my misgiving still
==146==Falls shrewdly to the purpose.

*Enter Antony.*

**BRU.**
==147==But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony!

**ANT.**
==148==O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?
==149==Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
==150==Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well!
==151==I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
==152==Who else must be let blood, who else is rank;
==153==If I myself, there is no hour so fit
==154==As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument
==155==Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
==156==With the most noble blood of all this world.
==157==I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
==158==Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
==159==Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
==160==I shall not find myself so apt to die;
==161==No place will please me so, no mean of death,
==162==As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
==163==The choice and master spirits of this age.

**BRU.**
==164==O Antony! Beg not your death of us.
==165==Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
==166==As by our hands and this our present act
==167==You see we do, yet see you but our hands,
==168==And this the bleeding business they have done.
==169==Our hearts you see not, they are pitiful;
==170==And pity to the general wrong of Rome⁠—
==171==As fire drives out fire, so pity pity⁠—
==172==Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
==173==To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;
==174==Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts
==175==Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in
==176==With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.

**CAS.**
==177==Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s
==178==In the disposing of new dignities.

**BRU.**
==179==Only be patient till we have appeas’d
==180==The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
==181==And then we will deliver you the cause
==182==Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
==183==Have thus proceeded.

**ANT.**
==183==           I doubt not of your wisdom.
==184==Let each man render me his bloody hand.
==185==First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
==186==Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
==187==Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;
==188==Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
==189==Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.
==190==Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say?
==191==My credit now stands on such slippery ground
==192==That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
==193==Either a coward or a flatterer.
==194==That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true;
==195==If then thy spirit look upon us now,
==196==Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
==197==To see thy Antony making his peace,
==198==Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
==199==Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?
==200==Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
==201==Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
==202==It would become me better than to close
==203==In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
==204==Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay’d, brave hart,
==205==Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,
==206==Sign’d in thy spoil, and crimson’d in thy lethe.
==207==O world! Thou wast the forest to this hart,
==208==And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
==209==How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
==210==Dost thou here lie!

**CAS.**
==211==Mark Antony⁠—

**ANT.**
==211==        Pardon me, Caius Cassius!
==212==The enemies of Caesar shall say this:
==213==Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

**CAS.**
==214==I blame you not for praising Caesar so,
==215==But what compact mean you to have with us?
==216==Will you be prick’d in number of our friends,
==217==Or shall we on, and not depend on you?

**ANT.**
==218==Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed
==219==Sway’d from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
==220==Friends am I with you all, and love you all,
==221==Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
==222==Why, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous.

**BRU.**
==223==Or else were this a savage spectacle.
==224==Our reasons are so full of good regard
==225==That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
==226==You should be satisfied.

**ANT.**
==226==              That’s all I seek,
==227==And am, moreover, suitor that I may
==228==Produce his body to the market-place,
==229==And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
==230==Speak in the order of his funeral.

**BRU.**
==231==You shall, Mark Antony.

**CAS.**
==231==              Brutus, a word with you.
*(Aside to Brutus.)*
==232==You know not what you do. Do not consent
==233==That Antony speak in his funeral.
==234==Know you how much the people may be mov’d
==235==By that which he will utter?

**BRU.**
==235==              By your pardon⁠—
==236==I will myself into the pulpit first,
==237==And show the reason of our Caesar’s death.
==238==What Antony shall speak, I will protest
==239==He speaks by leave and by permission;
==240==And that we are contented Caesar shall
==241==Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
==242==It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

**CAS.**
==243==I know not what may fall, I like it not.

**BRU.**
==244==Mark Antony, here take you Caesar’s body.
==245==You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
==246==But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
==247==And say you do’t by our permission;
==248==Else shall you not have any hand at all
==249==About his funeral. And you shall speak
==250==In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
==251==After my speech is ended.

**ANT.**
==251==              Be it so;
==252==I do desire no more.

**BRU.**
==253==Prepare the body then, and follow us.

*Exeunt. Manet Antony.*

**ANT.**
==254==O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
==255==That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
==256==Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
==257==That ever lived in the tide of times.
==258==Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
==259==Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
==260==(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
==261==To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) 
==262==A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
==263==Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
==264==Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
==265==Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
==266==And dreadful objects so familiar,
==267==That mothers shall but smile when they behold
==268==Their infants quartered with the hands of war;
==269==All pity chok’d with custom of fell deeds;
==270==And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge,
==271==With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
==272==Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice
==273==Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war,
==274==That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
==275==With carrion men, groaning for burial.
*(Enter Octavius’s Attendant.)*
==276==You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?

**OCT. ATT.**
==277==I do, Mark Antony.

**ANT.**
==278==Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.

**OCT. ATT.**
==279==He did receive his letters, and is coming,
==280==And bid me say to you by word of mouth⁠—
==281==O Caesar!⁠—

*Seeing the body.*

**ANT.**
==282==Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.
==283==Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,
==284==Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
==285==Began to water. Is thy master coming?

**OCT. ATT.**
==286==He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.

**ANT.**
==287==Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanc’d.
==288==Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
==289==No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
==290==Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,
==291==Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
==292==Into the market-place. There shall I try,
==293==In my oration, how the people take
==294==The cruel issue of these bloody men,
==295==According to the which thou shalt discourse
==296==To young Octavius of the state of things.
==297==Lend me your hand.

*Exeunt with Caesar’s body.*
