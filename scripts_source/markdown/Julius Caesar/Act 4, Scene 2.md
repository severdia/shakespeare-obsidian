## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A camp near Sardis. Before Brutus’s tent.*

*Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Lucius, and the army. Titinius and Pindarus meet them.*

**BRU.**
==1== Stand ho!

**LUCIL.**
==2== Give the word ho! And stand.

**BRU.**
==3== What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?

**LUCIL.**
==4== He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
==5== To do you salutation from his master.

**BRU.**
==6== He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
==7== In his own change, or by ill officers,
==8== Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
==9== Things done undone; but if he be at hand
==10== I shall be satisfied.

**PIN.**
==10==            I do not doubt
==11== But that my noble master will appear
==12== Such as he is, full of regard and honor.

**BRU.**
==13== He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,
==14== How he receiv’d you; let me be resolv’d.

**LUCIL.**
==15== With courtesy and with respect enough,
==16== But not with such familiar instances,
==17== Nor with such free and friendly conference,
==18== As he hath us’d of old.

**BRU.**
==18==               Thou hast describ’d
==19== A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
==20== When love begins to sicken and decay
==21== It useth an enforced ceremony.
==22== There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
==23== But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
==24== Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
*(Low march within.)*
==25== But when they should endure the bloody spur,
==26== They fall their crests, and like deceitful jades
==27== Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?

**LUCIL.**
==28== They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter’d.
==29== The greater part, the horse in general,
==30== Are come with Cassius.

*Enter Cassius and his powers.*

**BRU.**
==31== Hark, he is arriv’d.
==32== March gently on to meet him.

**CAS.**
==33== Stand ho!

**BRU.**
==34== Stand ho! Speak the word along.

**1. SOLD.**
==35== Stand!

**2. SOLD.**
==36== Stand!

**3. SOLD.**
==37== Stand!

**CAS.**
==38== Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.

**BRU.**
==39== Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?
==40== And if not so, how should I wrong a brother?

**CAS.**
==41== Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,
==42== And when you do them⁠—

**BRU.**
==42==               Cassius, be content,
==43== Speak your griefs softly; I do know you well.
==44== Before the eyes of both our armies here
==45== (Which should perceive nothing but love from us) 
==46== Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;
==47== Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
==48== And I will give you audience.

**CAS.**
==48==                 Pindarus,
==49== Bid our commanders lead their charges off
==50== A little from this ground.

**BRU.**
==51== Lucius, do you the like, and let no man
==52== Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
==53== Let Lucilius and Titinius guard our door.

*Exeunt. Manent Brutus and Cassius, who withdraw into Brutus’ tent, while Lucilius and Titinius mount guard without.*
