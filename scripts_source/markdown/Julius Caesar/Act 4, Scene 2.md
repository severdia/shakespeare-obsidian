## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A camp near Sardis. Before Brutus’s tent.*

*Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Lucius, and the army. Titinius and Pindarus meet them.*

**BRU.**
Stand ho!

**LUCIL.**
Give the word ho! And stand.

**BRU.**
What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?

**LUCIL.**
He is at hand, and Pindarus is come
To do you salutation from his master.

**BRU.**
He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
In his own change, or by ill officers,
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
Things done undone; but if he be at hand
I shall be satisfied.

**PIN.**
           I do not doubt
But that my noble master will appear
Such as he is, full of regard and honor.

**BRU.**
He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,
How he receiv’d you; let me be resolv’d.

**LUCIL.**
With courtesy and with respect enough,
But not with such familiar instances,
Nor with such free and friendly conference,
As he hath us’d of old.

**BRU.**
              Thou hast describ’d
A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,
When love begins to sicken and decay
It useth an enforced ceremony.
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
*(Low march within.)*
But when they should endure the bloody spur,
They fall their crests, and like deceitful jades
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?

**LUCIL.**
They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter’d.
The greater part, the horse in general,
Are come with Cassius.

*Enter Cassius and his powers.*

**BRU.**
Hark, he is arriv’d.
March gently on to meet him.

**CAS.**
Stand ho!

**BRU.**
Stand ho! Speak the word along.

**1. SOLD.**
Stand!

**2. SOLD.**
Stand!

**3. SOLD.**
Stand!

**CAS.**
Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.

**BRU.**
Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?
And if not so, how should I wrong a brother?

**CAS.**
Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,
And when you do them⁠—

**BRU.**
              Cassius, be content,
Speak your griefs softly; I do know you well.
Before the eyes of both our armies here
(Which should perceive nothing but love from us) 
Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
And I will give you audience.

**CAS.**
                Pindarus,
Bid our commanders lead their charges off
A little from this ground.

**BRU.**
Lucius, do you the like, and let no man
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
Let Lucilius and Titinius guard our door.

*Exeunt. Manent Brutus and Cassius, who withdraw into Brutus’ tent, while Lucilius and Titinius mount guard without.*
