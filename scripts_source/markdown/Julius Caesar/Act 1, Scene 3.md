## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. A street.*

*Thunder and lightning.*

*Enter from opposite sides Casca with his sword drawn and Cicero.*

**CIC.**
==1==Good even, Casca; brought you Caesar home?
==2==Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?

**CASCA.**
==3==Are not you mov’d, when all the sway of earth
==4==Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
==5==I have seen tempests when the scolding winds
==6==Have riv’d the knotty oaks, and I have seen
==7==Th’ ambitious ocean swell, and rage, and foam,
==8==To be exalted with the threat’ning clouds;
==9==But never till tonight, never till now,
==10==Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
==11==Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
==12==Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
==13==Incenses them to send destruction.

**CIC.**
==14==Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?

**CASCA.**
==15==A common slave—you know him well by sight⁠—
==16==Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
==17==Like twenty torches join’d; and yet his hand,
==18==Not sensible of fire, remain’d unscorch’d.
==19==Besides—I ha’ not since put up my sword⁠—
==20==Against the Capitol I met a lion,
==21==Who glaz’d upon me, and went surly by,
==22==Without annoying me. And there were drawn
==23==Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
==24==Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw
==25==Men, all in fire, walk up and down the streets.
==26==And yesterday the bird of night did sit
==27==Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
==28==Howting and shrieking. When these prodigies
==29==Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,
==30==“These are their reasons, they are natural”;
==31==For I believe they are portentous things
==32==Unto the climate that they point upon.

**CIC.**
==33==Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time;
==34==But men may construe things after their fashion,
==35==Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
==36==Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?

**CASCA.**
==37==He doth; for he did bid Antonio
==38==Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.

**CIC.**
==39==Good night then, Casca; this disturbed sky
==40==Is not to walk in.

**CASCA.**
==40==           Farewell, Cicero.

*Exit Cicero.*

*Enter Cassius.*

**CAS.**
==41==Who’s there?

**CASCA.**
==41==        A Roman.

**CAS.**
==41==              Casca, by your voice.

**CASCA.**
==42==Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!

**CAS.**
==43==A very pleasing night to honest men.

**CASCA.**
==44==Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

**CAS.**
==45==Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
==46==For my part, I have walk’d about the streets,
==47==Submitting me unto the perilous night;
==48==And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
==49==Have bar’d my bosom to the thunder-stone;
==50==And when the cross blue lightning seem’d to open
==51==The breast of heaven, I did present myself
==52==Even in the aim and very flash of it.

**CASCA.**
==53==But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
==54==It is the part of men to fear and tremble
==55==When the most mighty gods by tokens send
==56==Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.

**CAS.**
==57==You are dull, Casca; and those sparks of life
==58==That should be in a Roman you do want,
==59==Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze,
==60==And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder,
==61==To see the strange impatience of the heavens;
==62==But if you would consider the true cause
==63==Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
==64==Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
==65==Why old men, fools, and children calculate,
==66==Why all these things change from their ordinance,
==67==Their natures, and preformed faculties,
==68==To monstrous quality—why, you shall find
==69==That heaven hath infus’d them with these spirits,
==70==To make them instruments of fear and warning
==71==Unto some monstrous state.
==72==Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
==73==Most like this dreadful night,
==74==That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
==75==As doth the lion in the Capitol⁠—
==76==A man no mightier than thyself, or me,
==77==In personal action, yet prodigious grown,
==78==And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.

**CASCA.**
==79==’Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?

**CAS.**
==80==Let it be who it is; for Romans now
==81==Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
==82==But woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead,
==83==And we are govern’d with our mothers’ spirits;
==84==Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.

**CASCA.**
==85==Indeed, they say, the senators tomorrow
==86==Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
==87==And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
==88==In every place, save here in Italy.

**CAS.**
==89==I know where I will wear this dagger then;
==90==Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.
==91==Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
==92==Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat;
==93==Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
==94==Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
==95==Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
==96==But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
==97==Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
==98==If I know this, know all the world besides,
==99==That part of tyranny that I do bear
==100==I can shake off at pleasure.

*Thunder still.*

**CASCA.**
==100==                So can I;
==101==So every bondman in his own hand bears
==102==The power to cancel his captivity.

**CAS.**
==103==And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
==104==Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf,
==105==But that he sees the Romans are but sheep;
==106==He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
==107==Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
==108==Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome?
==109==What rubbish and what offal? When it serves
==110==For the base matter to illuminate
==111==So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
==112==Where hast thou led me? I, perhaps, speak this
==113==Before a willing bondman; then I know
==114==My answer must be made. But I am arm’d,
==115==And dangers are to me indifferent.

**CASCA.**
==116==You speak to Casca, and to such a man
==117==That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand.
==118==Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
==119==And I will set this foot of mine as far
==120==As who goes farthest.

**CAS.**
==120==           There’s a bargain made.
==121==Now know you, Casca, I have mov’d already
==122==Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
==123==To undergo with me an enterprise
==124==Of honorable-dangerous consequence;
==125==And I do know, by this they stay for me
==126==In Pompey’s Porch; for now, this fearful night,
==127==There is no stir or walking in the streets;
==128==And the complexion of the element
==129==In favor’s like the work we have in hand,
==130==Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

*Enter Cinna.*

**CASCA.**
==131==Stand close a while, for here comes one in haste.

**CAS.**
==132==’Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait,
==133==He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?

**CIN.**
==134==To find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber?

**CAS.**
==135==No, it is Casca, one incorporate
==136==To our attempts. Am I not stay’d for, Cinna?

**CIN.**
==137==I am glad on’t. What a fearful night is this!
==138==There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.

**CAS.**
==139==Am I not stay’d for? Tell me.

**CIN.**
==139==                Yes, you are.
==140==O Cassius, if you could
==141==But win the noble Brutus to our party⁠—

**CAS.**
==142==Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,
==143==And look you lay it in the praetor’s chair,
==144==Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
==145==In at his window; set this up with wax
==146==Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done,
==147==Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us.
==148==Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

**CIN.**
==149==All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone
==150==To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
==151==And so bestow these papers as you bade me.

**CAS.**
==152==That done, repair to Pompey’s theatre.
*(Exit Cinna.)*
==153==Come, Casca, you and I will yet, ere day,
==154==See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him
==155==Is ours already, and the man entire
==156==Upon the next encounter yields him ours.

**CASCA.**
==157==O, he sits high in all the people’s hearts;
==158==And that which would appear offense in us,
==159==His countenance, like richest alchymy,
==160==Will change to virtue and to worthiness.

**CAS.**
==161==Him and his worth, and our great need of him,
==162==You have right well conceited. Let us go,
==163==For it is after midnight, and ere day
==164==We will awake him and be sure of him.

*Exeunt.*
