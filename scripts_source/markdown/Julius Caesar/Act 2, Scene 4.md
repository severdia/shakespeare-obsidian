## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. A street before the house of Brutus.*

*Enter Portia and Lucius.*

**POR.**
==1== I prithee, boy, run to the Senate-house;
==2== Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
==3== Why dost thou stay?

**LUC.**
==3==            To know my errand, madam.

**POR.**
==4== I would have had thee there and here again
==5== Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.⁠—
==6== O constancy, be strong upon my side,
==7== Set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue!
==8== I have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might.
==9== How hard it is for women to keep counsel!⁠—
==10== Art thou here yet?

**LUC.**
==10==            Madam, what should I do?
==11== Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
==12== And so return to you, and nothing else?

**POR.**
==13== Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
==14== For he went sickly forth; and take good note
==15== What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
==16== Hark, boy, what noise is that?

**LUC.**
==17== I hear none, madam.

**POR.**
==17==            Prithee listen well;
==18== I heard a bustling rumor, like a fray,
==19== And the wind brings it from the Capitol.

**LUC.**
==20== Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.

*Enter the Soothsayer.*

**POR.**
==21== Come hither, fellow; which way hast thou been?

**SOOTH.**
==22== At mine own house, good lady.

**POR.**
==23== What is’t a’ clock?

**SOOTH.**
==23==            About the ninth hour, lady.

**POR.**
==24== Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?

**SOOTH.**
==25== Madam, not yet; I go to take my stand,
==26== To see him pass on to the Capitol.

**POR.**
==27== Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?

**SOOTH.**
==28== That I have, lady, if it will please Caesar
==29== To be so good to Caesar as to hear me:
==30== I shall beseech him to befriend himself.

**POR.**
==31== Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?

**SOOTH.**
==32== None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
==33== Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow;
==34== The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
==35== Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
==36== Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
==37== I’ll get me to a place more void, and there
==38== Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

*Exit.*

**POR.**
==39== I must go in. Ay me! How weak a thing
==40== The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
==41== The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
==42== Sure the boy heard me.—Brutus hath a suit
==43== That Caesar will not grant.—O, I grow faint.⁠—
==44== Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord,
==45== Say I am merry. Come to me again,
==46== And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

*Exeunt severally.*
