## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. A street before the house of Brutus.*

*Enter Portia and Lucius.*

**POR.**
I prithee, boy, run to the Senate-house;
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
Why dost thou stay?

**LUC.**
           To know my errand, madam.

**POR.**
I would have had thee there and here again
Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.⁠—
O constancy, be strong upon my side,
Set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue!
I have a man’s mind, but a woman’s might.
How hard it is for women to keep counsel!⁠—
Art thou here yet?

**LUC.**
           Madam, what should I do?
Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
And so return to you, and nothing else?

**POR.**
Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
For he went sickly forth; and take good note
What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
Hark, boy, what noise is that?

**LUC.**
I hear none, madam.

**POR.**
           Prithee listen well;
I heard a bustling rumor, like a fray,
And the wind brings it from the Capitol.

**LUC.**
Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.

*Enter the Soothsayer.*

**POR.**
Come hither, fellow; which way hast thou been?

**SOOTH.**
At mine own house, good lady.

**POR.**
What is’t a’ clock?

**SOOTH.**
           About the ninth hour, lady.

**POR.**
Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?

**SOOTH.**
Madam, not yet; I go to take my stand,
To see him pass on to the Capitol.

**POR.**
Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?

**SOOTH.**
That I have, lady, if it will please Caesar
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me:
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.

**POR.**
Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him?

**SOOTH.**
None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow;
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.
I’ll get me to a place more void, and there
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

*Exit.*

**POR.**
I must go in. Ay me! How weak a thing
The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
Sure the boy heard me.—Brutus hath a suit
That Caesar will not grant.—O, I grow faint.⁠—
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord,
Say I am merry. Come to me again,
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

*Exeunt severally.*
