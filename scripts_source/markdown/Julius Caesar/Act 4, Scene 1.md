## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*A house in Rome.*

*Enter Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus.*

**ANT.**
==1== These many then shall die, their names are prick’d.

**OCT.**
==2== Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?

**LEP.**
==3== I do consent⁠—

**OCT.**
==3==         Prick him down, Antony.

**LEP.**
==4== Upon condition Publius shall not live,
==5== Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony.

**ANT.**
==6== He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
==7== But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house;
==8== Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
==9== How to cut off some charge in legacies.

**LEP.**
==10== What? Shall I find you here?

**OCT.**
==11== Or here or at the Capitol.

*Exit Lepidus.*

**ANT.**
==12== This is a slight unmeritable man,
==13== Meet to be sent on errands; is it fit,
==14== The threefold world divided, he should stand
==15== One of the three to share it?

**OCT.**
==15==               So you thought him,
==16== And took his voice who should be prick’d to die
==17== In our black sentence and proscription.

**ANT.**
==18== Octavius, I have seen more days than you,
==19== And though we lay these honors on this man
==20== To ease ourselves of diverse sland’rous loads,
==21== He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
==22== To groan and sweat under the business,
==23== Either led or driven, as we point the way;
==24== And having brought our treasure where we will,
==25== Then take we down his load, and turn him off
==26== (Like to the empty ass) to shake his ears
==27== And graze in commons.

**OCT.**
==27==               You may do your will;
==28== But he’s a tried and valiant soldier.

**ANT.**
==29== So is my horse, Octavius, and for that
==30== I do appoint him store of provender.
==31== It is a creature that I teach to fight,
==32== To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
==33== His corporal motion govern’d by my spirit;
==34== And in some taste is Lepidus but so:
==35== He must be taught, and train’d, and bid go forth;
==36== A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
==37== On objects, arts, and imitations,
==38== Which, out of use and stal’d by other men,
==39== Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him
==40== But as a property. And now, Octavius,
==41== Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius
==42== Are levying powers; we must straight make head;
==43== Therefore let our alliance be combin’d,
==44== Our best friends made, our means stretch’d,
==45== And let us presently go sit in council,
==46== How covert matters may be best disclos’d,
==47== And open perils surest answered.

**OCT.**
==48== Let us do so; for we are at the stake,
==49== And bay’d about with many enemies,
==50== And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
==51== Millions of mischiefs.

*Exeunt.*
