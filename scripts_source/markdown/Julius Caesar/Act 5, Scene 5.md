## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]]

*The plains of Philippi. Another part of the battlefield.*

*Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.*

**BRU.**
==1==Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.

**CLI.**
==2==Statilius show’d the torchlight, but, my lord,
==3==He came not back. He is or ta’en or slain.

**BRU.**
==4==Sit thee down, Clitus; slaying is the word,
==5==It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.

*Whispering.*

**CLI.**
==6==What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.

**BRU.**
==7==Peace then, no words.

**CLI.**
==7==              I’ll rather kill myself.

**BRU.**
==8==Hark thee, Dardanius.

*Whispering.*

**DAR.**
==8==              Shall I do such a deed?

**CLI.**
==9==O Dardanius!

**DAR.**
==10==O Clitus!

**CLI.**
==11==What ill request did Brutus make to thee?

**DAR.**
==12==To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.

**CLI.**
==13==Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
==14==That it runs over even at his eyes.

**BRU.**
==15==Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.

**VOL.**
==16==What says my lord?

**BRU.**
==16==           Why, this, Volumnius:
==17==The ghost of Caesar hath appear’d to me
==18==Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
==19==And this last night, here in Philippi fields.
==20==I know my hour is come.

**VOL.**
==20==              Not so, my lord.

**BRU.**
==21==Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
==22==Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
==23==Our enemies have beat us to the pit.
*(Low alarums.)*
==24==It is more worthy to leap in ourselves
==25==Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
==26==Thou know’st that we two went to school together;
==27==Even for that our love of old, I prithee
==28==Hold thou my sword—hilts, whilest I run on it.

**VOL.**
==29==That’s not an office for a friend, my lord.

*Alarum still.*

**CLI.**
==30==Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.

**BRU.**
==31==Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.
==32==Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
==33==Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
==34==My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
==35==I found no man but he was true to me.
==36==I shall have glory by this losing day
==37==More than Octavius and Mark Antony
==38==By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
==39==So fare you well at once, for Brutus’ tongue
==40==Hath almost ended his live’s history.
==41==Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest,
==42==That have but labor’d to attain this hour.

*Alarum. Cry within, “Fly, fly, fly!”*

**CLI.**
==43==Fly, my lord, fly.

**BRU.**
==43==           Hence! I will follow.
*(Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius.)*
==44==I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.
==45==Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
==46==Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.
==47==Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
==48==While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?

**STRA.**
==49==Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.

**BRU.**
==50==Farewell, good Strato.
*(Runs on his sword.)*
==51==Caesar, now be still,
==52==I kill’d not thee with half so good a will.

*Dies.*

*Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala, Lucilius, and the army.*

**OCT.**
==53==What man is that?

**MES.**
==54==My master’s man. Strato, where is thy master?

**STRA.**
==55==Free from the bondage you are in, Messala;
==56==The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
==57==For Brutus only overcame himself,
==58==And no man else hath honor by his death.

**LUCIL.**
==59==So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
==60==That thou hast prov’d Lucilius’ saying true.

**OCT.**
==61==All that serv’d Brutus, I will entertain them.
==62==Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?

**STRA.**
==63==Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.

**OCT.**
==64==Do so, good Messala.

**MES.**
==65==How died my master, Strato?

**STRA.**
==66==I held the sword, and he did run on it.

**MES.**
==67==Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
==68==That did the latest service to my master.

**ANT.**
==69==This was the noblest Roman of them all:
==70==All the conspirators, save only he,
==71==Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
==72==He, only in a general honest thought
==73==And common good to all, made one of them.
==74==His life was gentle, and the elements
==75==So mix’d in him that Nature might stand up
==76==And say to all the world, “This was a man!”

**OCT.**
==77==According to his virtue let us use him,
==78==With all respect and rites of burial.
==79==Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,
==80==Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.
==81==So call the field to rest, and let’s away,
==82==To part the glories of this happy day.

*Exeunt omnes.*
