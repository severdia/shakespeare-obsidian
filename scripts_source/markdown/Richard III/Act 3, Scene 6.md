## Act 3, Scene 6
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 7|Act 3, Scene 7 →]]

*London. A street.*

*Enter a Scrivener with a paper in his hand.*

**SCRIV.**
==1==Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings,
==2==Which in a set hand fairly is engross’d
==3==That it may be today read o’er in Paul’s.
==4==And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
==5==Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,
==6==For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;
==7==The precedent was full as long a-doing,
==8==And yet within these five hours Hastings liv’d,
==9==Untainted, unexamin’d, free, at liberty.
==10==Here’s a good world the while! Who is so gross
==11==That cannot see this palpable device?
==12==Yet who’s so bold but says he sees it not?
==13==Bad is the world, and all will come to nought,
==14==When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.

*Exit.*
