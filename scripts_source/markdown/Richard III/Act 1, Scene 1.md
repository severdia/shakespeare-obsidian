## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*London. A street.*

*Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester solus.*

**GLOU.**
==1==Now is the winter of our discontent
==2==Made glorious summer by this son of York;
==3==And all the clouds that low’r’d upon our house
==4==In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
==5==Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,
==6==Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,
==7==Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings,
==8==Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
==9==Grim-visag’d War hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;
==10==And now, in stead of mounting barbed steeds
==11==To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
==12==He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber
==13==To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
==14==But I, that am not shap’d for sportive tricks,
==15==Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
==16==I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty
==17==To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
==18==I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,
==19==Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
==20==Deform’d, unfinish’d, sent before my time
==21==Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
==22==And that so lamely and unfashionable
==23==That dogs bark at me as I halt by them⁠—
==24==Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
==25==Have no delight to pass away the time,
==26==Unless to see my shadow in the sun
==27==And descant on mine own deformity.
==28==And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover
==29==To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
==30==I am determined to prove a villain
==31==And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
==32==Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
==33==By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
==34==To set my brother Clarence and the King
==35==In deadly hate the one against the other;
==36==And if King Edward be as true and just
==37==As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
==38==This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up
==39==About a prophecy, which says that G
==40==Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.
==41==Dive, thoughts, down to my soul, here Clarence comes!
*(Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury, Lieutenant of the Tower.)*
==42==Brother, good day. What means this armed guard
==43==That waits upon your Grace?

**CLAR.**
==43==                His Majesty,
==44==Tend’ring my person’s safety, hath appointed
==45==This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

**GLOU.**
==46==Upon what cause?

**CLAR.**
==46==           Because my name is George.

**GLOU.**
==47==Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
==48==He should for that commit your godfathers.
==49==O, belike his Majesty hath some intent
==50==That you should be new christ’ned in the Tower.
==51==But what’s the matter, Clarence, may I know?

**CLAR.**
==52==Yea, Richard, when I know; but I protest
==53==As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,
==54==He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,
==55==And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,
==56==And says a wizard told him that by G
==57==His issue disinherited should be;
==58==And for my name of George begins with G,
==59==It follows in his thought that I am he.
==60==These (as I learn) and such-like toys as these
==61==Hath mov’d his Highness to commit me now.

**GLOU.**
==62==Why, this it is, when men are rul’d by women:
==63==’Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;
==64==My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she
==65==That tempers him to this extremity.
==66==Was it not she, and that good man of worship,
==67==Anthony Woodvile, her brother there,
==68==That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
==69==From whence this present day he is delivered?
==70==We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe.

**CLAR.**
==71==By heaven, I think there is no man is secure
==72==But the Queen’s kindred, and night-walking heralds
==73==That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.
==74==Heard you not what an humble suppliant
==75==Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?

**GLOU.**
==76==Humbly complaining to her deity
==77==Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.
==78==I’ll tell you what, I think it is our way,
==79==If we will keep in favor with the King,
==80==To be her men and wear her livery.
==81==The jealous o’erworn widow and herself,
==82==Since that our brother dubb’d them gentlewomen,
==83==Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.

**BRAK.**
==84==I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:
==85==His Majesty hath straitly given in charge
==86==That no man shall have private conference
==87==(Of what degree soever) with your brother.

**GLOU.**
==88==Even so? And please your worship, Brakenbury,
==89==You may partake of any thing we say:
==90==We speak no treason, man. We say the King
==91==Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
==92==Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
==93==We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,
==94==A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
==95==And that the Queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.
==96==How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?

**BRAK.**
==97==With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.

**GLOU.**
==98==Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,
==99==He that doth naught with her (excepting one) 
==100==Were best to do it secretly alone.

**BRAK.**
==101==What one, my lord?

**GLOU.**
==102==Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?

**BRAK.**
==103==I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal
==104==Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.

**CLAR.**
==105==We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.

**GLOU.**
==106==We are the Queen’s abjects, and must obey.
==107==Brother, farewell, I will unto the King,
==108==And whatsoe’er you will employ me in,
==109==Were it to call King Edward’s widow sister,
==110==I will perform it to enfranchise you.
==111==Mean time, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
==112==Touches me deeper than you can imagine.

**CLAR.**
==113==I know it pleaseth neither of us well.

**GLOU.**
==114==Well, your imprisonment shall not be long,
==115==I will deliver you, or else lie for you.
==116==Mean time, have patience.

**CLAR.**
==116==              I must perforce. Farewell.

*Exit Clarence with Brakenbury and Guard.*

**GLOU.**
==117==Go tread the path that thou shalt ne’er return:
==118==Simple plain Clarence, I do love thee so
==119==That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
==120==If heaven will take the present at our hands.
==121==But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?

*Enter Lord Hastings.*

**HAST.**
==122==Good time of day unto my gracious lord!

**GLOU.**
==123==As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!
==124==Well are you welcome to the open air.
==125==How hath your lordship brook’d imprisonment?

**HAST.**
==126==With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;
==127==But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
==128==That were the cause of my imprisonment.

**GLOU.**
==129==No doubt, no doubt, and so shall Clarence too,
==130==For they that were your enemies are his,
==131==And have prevail’d as much on him as you.

**HAST.**
==132==More pity that the eagles should be mew’d,
==133==Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.

**GLOU.**
==134==What news abroad?

**HAST.**
==135==No news so bad abroad as this at home:
==136==The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
==137==And his physicians fear him mightily.

**GLOU.**
==138==Now by Saint John, that news is bad indeed!
==139==O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
==140==And overmuch consum’d his royal person:
==141==’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
==142==Where is he? In his bed?

**HAST.**
==143==He is.

**GLOU.**
==144==Go you before, and I will follow you.
*(Exit Hastings.)*
==145==He cannot live, I hope, and must not die
==146==Till George be pack’d with post-horse up to heaven.
==147==I’ll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence
==148==With lies well steel’d with weighty arguments,
==149==And if I fail not in my deep intent,
==150==Clarence hath not another day to live:
==151==Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
==152==And leave the world for me to bustle in!
==153==For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.
==154==What though I kill’d her husband and her father?
==155==The readiest way to make the wench amends
==156==Is to become her husband and her father:
==157==The which will I, not all so much for love
==158==As for another secret close intent
==159==By marrying her which I must reach unto.
==160==But yet I run before my horse to market:
==161==Clarence still breathes, Edward still lives and reigns;
==162==When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

*Exit.*
