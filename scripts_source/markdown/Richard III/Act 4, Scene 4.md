## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*London. Before the palace.*

*Enter old Queen Margaret.*

**Q. MARG.**
==1== So now prosperity begins to mellow
==2== And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
==3== Here in these confines slyly have I lurk’d,
==4== To watch the waning of mine enemies.
==5== A dire induction am I witness to,
==6== And will to France, hoping the consequence
==7== Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
==8== Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret; who comes here?

*Retires.*

*Enter Duchess of York and Queen Elizabeth.*

**Q. ELIZ.**
==9== Ah, my poor princes! Ah, my tender babes!
==10== My unblown flow’rs, new-appearing sweets!
==11== If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
==12== And be not fix’d in doom perpetual,
==13== Hover about me with your aery wings
==14== And hear your mother’s lamentation!

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==15== Hover about her; say that right for right
==16== Hath dimm’d your infant morn to aged night.

**DUCH.**
==17== So many miseries have craz’d my voice
==18== That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.
==19== Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==20== Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet,
==21== Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==22== Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
==23== And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
==24== When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==25== When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.

**DUCH.**
==26== Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal-living ghost,
==27== Woe’s scene, world’s shame, grave’s due by life usurp’d,
==28== Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
==29== Rest thy unrest on England’s lawful earth,
*(Sitting down.)*
==30== Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==31== Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave
==32== As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
==33== Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
==34== Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?

*Sitting down by her.*

**Q. MARG.**
*(Coming forward.)*
==35== If ancient sorrow be most reverent,
==36== Give mine the benefit of seniory,
==37== And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.
==38== If sorrow can admit society,
*(Sitting down with them.)*
==39== Tell over your woes again by viewing mine:
==40== I had an Edward, till a Richard kill’d him;
==41== I had a Harry, till a Richard kill’d him:
==42== Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill’d him;
==43== Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill’d him.

**DUCH.**
==44== I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
==45== I had a Rutland too, thou help’st to kill him.

**Q. MARG.**
==46== Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill’d him.
==47== From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
==48== A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
==49== That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes
==50== To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
==51== That foul defacer of God’s handiwork,
==52== That excellent grand tyrant of the earth
==53== That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
==54== Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.
==55== O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
==56== How do I thank thee that this carnal cur
==57== Preys on the issue of his mother’s body,
==58== And makes her pew-fellow with others’ moan!

**DUCH.**
==59== O Harry’s wife, triumph not in my woes!
==60== God witness with me, I have wept for thine.

**Q. MARG.**
==61== Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
==62== And now I cloy me with beholding it.
==63== Thy Edward he is dead, that kill’d my Edward;
==64== Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
==65== Young York he is but boot, because both they
==66== Match’d not the high perfection of my loss.
==67== Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb’d my Edward,
==68== And the beholders of this frantic play,
==69== Th’ adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
==70== Untimely smoth’red in their dusky graves.
==71== Richard yet lives, hell’s black intelligencer,
==72== Only reserv’d their factor to buy souls
==73== And send them thither; but at hand, at hand,
==74== Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.
==75== Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,
==76== To have him suddenly convey’d from hence.
==77== Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,
==78== That I may live and say, “The dog is dead.”

**Q. ELIZ.**
==79== O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
==80== That I should wish for thee to help me curse
==81== That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back’d toad!

**Q. MARG.**
==82== I call’d thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
==83== I call’d thee then poor shadow, painted queen,
==84== The presentation of but what I was;
==85== The flattering index of a direful pageant;
==86== One heav’d a-high, to be hurl’d down below;
==87== A mother only mock’d with two fair babes;
==88== A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag
==89== To be the aim of every dangerous shot;
==90== A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble;
==91== A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
==92== Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?
==93== Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?
==94== Who sues, and kneels, and says, “God save the Queen”?
==95== Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?
==96== Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?
==97== Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
==98== For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
==99== For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
==100== For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
==101== For queen, a very caitiff crown’d with care;
==102== For she that scorn’d at me, now scorn’d of me;
==103== For she being feared of all, now fearing one;
==104== For she commanding all, obey’d of none.
==105== Thus hath the course of justice whirl’d about,
==106== And left thee but a very prey to time,
==107== Having no more but thought of what thou wast
==108== To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
==109== Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
==110== Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
==111== Now thy proud neck bears half my burden’d yoke,
==112== From which even here I slip my weary head,
==113== And leave the burden of it all on thee.
==114== Farewell, York’s wife, and queen of sad mischance,
==115== These English woes shall make me smile in France.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==116== O thou well skill’d in curses, stay awhile,
==117== And teach me how to curse mine enemies!

**Q. MARG.**
==118== Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
==119== Compare dead happiness with living woe;
==120== Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,
==121== And he that slew them fouler than he is.
==122== Bett’ring thy loss makes the bad causer worse;
==123== Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==124== My words are dull, O, quicken them with thine!

**Q. MARG.**
==125== Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.

*Exit Queen Margaret.*

**DUCH.**
==126== Why should calamity be full of words?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==127== Windy attorneys to their client’s woes,
==128== Aery succeeders of intestate joys,
==129== Poor breathing orators of miseries,
==130== Let them have scope! Though what they will impart
==131== Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.

**DUCH.**
==132== If so then, be not tongue-tied; go with me,
==133== And in the breath of bitter words let’s smother
==134== My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother’d.
==135== The trumpet sounds, be copious in exclaims.

*Enter King Richard and his Train marching, with Drums and Trumpets.*

**K. RICH.**
==136== Who intercepts me in my expedition?

**DUCH.**
==137== O, she that might have intercepted thee,
==138== By strangling thee in her accursed womb,
==139== From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==140== Hid’st thou that forehead with a golden crown
==141== Where should be branded, if that right were right,
==142== The slaughter of the prince that ow’d that crown,
==143== And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?
==144== Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?

**DUCH.**
==145== Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
==146== And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==147== Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

**DUCH.**
==148== Where is kind Hastings?

**K. RICH.**
==149== A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!
==150== Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
==151== Rail on the Lord’s anointed. Strike, I say!
*(Flourish. Alarums.)*
==152== Either be patient and entreat me fair,
==153== Or with the clamorous report of war
==154== Thus will I drown your exclamations.

**DUCH.**
==155== Art thou my son?

**K. RICH.**
==156== Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

**DUCH.**
==157== Then patiently hear my impatience.

**K. RICH.**
==158== Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
==159== That cannot brook the accent of reproof.

**DUCH.**
==160== O, let me speak!

**K. RICH.**
==160==            Do then, but I’ll not hear.

**DUCH.**
==161== I will be mild and gentle in my words.

**K. RICH.**
==162== And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.

**DUCH.**
==163== Art thou so hasty? I have stay’d for thee,
==164== God knows, in torment and in agony.

**K. RICH.**
==165== And came I not at last to comfort you?

**DUCH.**
==166== No, by the holy rood, thou know’st it well,
==167== Thou cam’st on earth to make the earth my hell.
==168== A grievous burden was thy birth to me,
==169== Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
==170== Thy school-days frightful, desp’rate, wild, and furious,
==171== Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;
==172== Thy age confirm’d, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,
==173== More mild, but yet more harmful—kind in hatred.
==174== What comfortable hour canst thou name
==175== That ever grac’d me with thy company?

**K. RICH.**
==176== Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call’d your Grace
==177== To breakfast once, forth of my company.
==178== If I be so disgracious in your eye,
==179== Let me march on and not offend you, madam.
==180== Strike up the drum.

**DUCH.**
==180==            I prithee hear me speak.

**K. RICH.**
==181== You speak too bitterly.

**DUCH.**
==181==               Hear me a word;
==182== For I shall never speak to thee again.

**K. RICH.**
==183== So.

**DUCH.**
==184== Either thou wilt die by God’s just ordinance
==185== Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
==186== Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
==187== And never more behold thy face again.
==188== Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,
==189== Which in the day of battle tire thee more
==190== Than all the complete armor that thou wear’st!
==191== My prayers on the adverse party fight,
==192== And there the little souls of Edward’s children
==193== Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
==194== And promise them success and victory.
==195== Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
==196== Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

*Exit.*

**Q. ELIZ.**
==197== Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
==198== Abides in me; I say amen to her.

**K. RICH.**
==199== Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==200== I have no more sons of the royal blood
==201== For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,
==202== They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
==203== And therefore level not to hit their lives.

**K. RICH.**
==204== You have a daughter call’d Elizabeth,
==205== Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==206== And must she die for this? O, let her live!
==207== And I’ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,
==208== Slander myself as false to Edward’s bed,
==209== Throw over her the veil of infamy.
==210== So she may live unscarr’d of bleeding slaughter,
==211== I will confess she was not Edward’s daughter.

**K. RICH.**
==212== Wrong not her birth, she is a royal princess.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==213== To save her life, I’ll say she is not so.

**K. RICH.**
==214== Her life is safest only in her birth.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==215== And only in that safety died her brothers.

**K. RICH.**
==216== Lo at their birth good stars were opposite.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==217== No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.

**K. RICH.**
==218== All unavoided is the doom of destiny.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==219== True—when avoided grace makes destiny:
==220== My babes were destin’d to a fairer death,
==221== If grace had blest thee with a fairer life.

**K. RICH.**
==222== You speak as if that I had slain my cousins!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==223== Cousins indeed, and by their uncle cozen’d
==224== Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
==225== Whose hand soever lanch’d their tender hearts,
==226== Thy head (all indirectly) gave direction.
==227== No doubt the murd’rous knife was dull and blunt
==228== Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart
==229== To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
==230== But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
==231== My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
==232== Till that my nails were anchor’d in thine eyes;
==233== And I, in such a desp’rate bay of death,
==234== Like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,
==235== Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

**K. RICH.**
==236== Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
==237== And dangerous success of bloody wars,
==238== As I intend more good to you and yours
==239== Than ever you or yours by me were harm’d!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==240== What good is cover’d with the face of heaven,
==241== To be discover’d, that can do me good?

**K. RICH.**
==242== Th’ advancement of your children, gentle lady.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==243== Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.

**K. RICH.**
==244== Unto the dignity and height of fortune,
==245== The high imperial type of this earth’s glory.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==246== Flatter my sorrow with report of it;
==247== Tell me, what state, what dignity, what honor,
==248== Canst thou demise to any child of mine?

**K. RICH.**
==249== Even all I have—ay, and myself and all⁠—
==250== Will I withal endow a child of thine;
==251== So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
==252== Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
==253== Which thou supposest I have done to thee.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==254== Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness
==255== Last longer telling than thy kindness’ date.

**K. RICH.**
==256== Then know that from my soul I love thy daughter.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==257== My daughter’s mother thinks it with her soul.

**K. RICH.**
==258== What do you think?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==259== That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul;
==260== So from thy soul’s love didst thou love her brothers,
==261== And from my heart’s love I do thank thee for it.

**K. RICH.**
==262== Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
==263== I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter,
==264== And do intend to make her Queen of England.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==265== Well then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

**K. RICH.**
==266== Even he that makes her queen. Who should be else?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==267== What, thou?

**K. RICH.**
==267==         Even so. How think you of it?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==268== How canst thou woo her?

**K. RICH.**
==268==               That would I learn of you,
==269== As one being best acquainted with her humor.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==270== And wilt thou learn of me?

**K. RICH.**
==270==               Madam, with all my heart.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==271== Send to her by the man that slew her brothers
==272== A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave
==273== “Edward” and “York”; then haply will she weep.
==274== Therefore present to her—as sometimes Margaret
==275== Did to thy father, steep’d in Rutland’s blood⁠—
==276== A handkercher, which, say to her, did drain
==277== The purple sap from her sweet brother’s body,
==278== And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.
==279== If this inducement move her not to love,
==280== Send her a letter of thy noble deeds:
==281== Tell her thou mad’st away her uncle Clarence,
==282== Her uncle Rivers, ay (and for her sake!),
==283== Mad’st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

**K. RICH.**
==284== You mock me, madam, this is not the way
==285== To win your daughter.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==285==            There is no other way,
==286== Unless thou couldst put on some other shape
==287== And not be Richard that hath done all this.

**K. RICH.**
==288== Say that I did all this for love of her.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==289== Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
==290== Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.

**K. RICH.**
==291== Look what is done cannot be now amended:
==292== Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
==293== Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.
==294== If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
==295== To make amends I’ll give it to your daughter;
==296== If I have kill’d the issue of your womb,
==297== To quicken your increase, I will beget
==298== Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.
==299== A grandam’s name is little less in love
==300== Than is the doting title of a mother;
==301== They are as children but one step below,
==302== Even of your metal, of your very blood;
==303== Of all one pain, save for a night of groans
==304== Endur’d of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
==305== Your children were vexation to your youth,
==306== But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
==307== The loss you have is but a son being king,
==308== And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
==309== I cannot make you what amends I would,
==310== Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
==311== Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
==312== Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
==313== This fair alliance quickly shall call home
==314== To high promotions and great dignity.
==315== The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,
==316== Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
==317== Again shall you be mother to a king;
==318== And all the ruins of distressful times
==319== Repair’d with double riches of content.
==320== What? We have many goodly days to see:
==321== The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
==322== Shall come again, transform’d to orient pearl,
==323== Advantaging their love with interest
==324== Of ten times double gain of happiness.
==325== Go then, my mother, to thy daughter go,
==326== Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
==327== Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale;
==328== Put in her tender heart th’ aspiring flame
==329== Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess
==330== With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys;
==331== And when this arm of mine hath chastised
==332== The petty rebel, dull-brain’d Buckingham,
==333== Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
==334== And lead thy daughter to a conqueror’s bed;
==335== To whom I will retail my conquest won,
==336== And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar’s Caesar.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==337== What were I best to say? Her father’s brother
==338== Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?
==339== Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
==340== Under what title shall I woo for thee,
==341== That God, the law, my honor, and her love
==342== Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?

**K. RICH.**
==343== Infer fair England’s peace by this alliance.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==344== Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.

**K. RICH.**
==345== Tell her the King, that may command, entreats.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==346== That at her hands which the King’s King forbids.

**K. RICH.**
==347== Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==348== To vail the title, as her mother doth.

**K. RICH.**
==349== Say I will love her everlastingly.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==350== But how long shall that title “ever” last?

**K. RICH.**
==351== Sweetly in force unto her fair live’s end.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==352== But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?

**K. RICH.**
==353== As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==354== As long as hell and Richard likes of it.

**K. RICH.**
==355== Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==356== But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

**K. RICH.**
==357== Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==358== An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

**K. RICH.**
==359== Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==360== Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.

**K. RICH.**
==361== Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==362== O no, my reasons are too deep and dead⁠—
==363== Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.

**K. RICH.**
==364== Harp not on that string, madam, that is past.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==365== Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.

**K. RICH.**
==366== Now by my George, my Garter, and my crown⁠—

**Q. ELIZ.**
==367== Profan’d, dishonor’d, and the third usurp’d.

**K. RICH.**
==368== I swear⁠—

**Q. ELIZ.**
==368==     By nothing, for this is no oath:
==369== Thy George, profan’d, hath lost his lordly honor;
==370== Thy Garter, blemish’d, pawn’d his knightly virtue;
==371== Thy crown, usurp’d, disgrac’d his kingly glory.
==372== If something thou wouldst swear to be believ’d,
==373== Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong’d.

**K. RICH.**
==374== Then by myself⁠—

**Q. ELIZ.**
==374==         Thyself is self-misus’d.

**K. RICH.**
==375== Now by the world⁠—

**Q. ELIZ.**
==375==            ’Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

**K. RICH.**
==376== My father’s death⁠—

**Q. ELIZ.**
==376==            Thy life hath it dishonor’d.

**K. RICH.**
==377== Why then, by God⁠—

**Q. ELIZ.**
==377==            God’s wrong is most of all:
==378== If thou didst fear to break an oath with him,
==379== The unity the King my husband made
==380== Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.
==381== If thou hadst fear’d to break an oath by him,
==382== Th’ imperial metal, circling now thy head,
==383== Had grac’d the tender temples of my child,
==384== And both the Princes had been breathing here,
==385== Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,
==386== Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.
==387== What canst thou swear by now?

**K. RICH.**
==387==                   The time to come.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==388== That thou hast wronged in the time o’erpast;
==389== For I myself have many tears to wash
==390== Hereafter time, for time past wrong’d by thee.
==391== The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter’d,
==392== Ungovern’d youth, to wail it in their age;
==393== The parents live whose children thou hast butcher’d,
==394== Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.
==395== Swear not by time to come, for that thou hast
==396== Misus’d ere us’d, by times ill-us’d o’erpast.

**K. RICH.**
==397== As I intend to prosper and repent,
==398== So thrive I in my dangerous affairs
==399== Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!
==400== Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
==401== Day, yield me not thy light, nor, night, thy rest!
==402== Be opposite all planets of good luck
==403== To my proceeding, if with dear heart’s love,
==404== Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
==405== I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
==406== In her consists my happiness and thine;
==407== Without her, follows to myself and thee,
==408== Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,
==409== Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.
==410== It cannot be avoided but by this;
==411== It will not be avoided but by this.
==412== Therefore, dear mother—I must call you so⁠—
==413== Be the attorney of my love to her.
==414== Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
==415== Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.
==416== Urge the necessity and state of times,
==417== And be not peevish-fond in great designs.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==418== Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

**K. RICH.**
==419== Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==420== Shall I forget myself to be myself?

**K. RICH.**
==421== Ay, if yourself’s remembrance wrong yourself.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==422== Yet thou didst kill my children.

**K. RICH.**
==423== But in your daughter’s womb I bury them;
==424== Where in that nest of spicery they will breed
==425== Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==426== Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

**K. RICH.**
==427== And be a happy mother by the deed.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==428== I go. Write to me very shortly,
==429== And you shall understand from me her mind.

**K. RICH.**
==430== Bear her my true love’s kiss; and so farewell.
*(Exit Queen Elizabeth.)*
==431== Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
*(Enter Ratcliffe, Catesby following.)*
==432== How now? What news?

**RAT.**
==433== Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast
==434== Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores
==435== Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
==436== Unarm’d, and unresolv’d to beat them back.
==437== ’Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
==438== And there they hull, expecting but the aid
==439== Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.

**K. RICH.**
==440== Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk;
==441== Ratcliffe, thyself—or Catesby—where is he?

**CATE.**
==442== Here, my good lord.

**K. RICH.**
==442==            Catesby, fly to the Duke.

**CATE.**
==443== I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.

**K. RICH.**
==444== Ratcliffe, come hither. Post to Salisbury;
==445== When thou com’st thither⁠—
*(To Catesby.)*
==445==               Dull unmindful villain,
==446== Why stay’st thou here, and go’st not to the Duke?

**CATE.**
==447== First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness’ pleasure,
==448== What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.

**K. RICH.**
==449== O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight
==450== The greatest strength and power that he can make,
==451== And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.

**CATE.**
==452== I go.

*Exit.*

**RAT.**
==453== What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?

**K. RICH.**
==454== Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?

**RAT.**
==455== Your Highness told me I should post before.

**K. RICH.**
==456== My mind is chang’d.
*(Enter Lord Stanley.)*
==456==            Stanley, what news with you?

**STAN.**
==457== None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing,
==458== Nor none so bad but well may be reported.

**K. RICH.**
==459== Hoy-day, a riddle! Neither good nor bad!
==460== What need’st thou run so many miles about,
==461== When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?
==462== Once more, what news?

**STAN.**
==462==               Richmond is on the seas.

**K. RICH.**
==463== There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
==464== White-liver’d runagate, what doth he there?

**STAN.**
==465== I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.

**K. RICH.**
==466== Well, as you guess?

**STAN.**
==467== Stirr’d up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,
==468== He makes for England, here to claim the crown.

**K. RICH.**
==469== Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway’d?
==470== Is the King dead? The empire unpossess’d?
==471== What heir of York is there alive but we?
==472== And who is England’s king but great York’s heir?
==473== Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?

**STAN.**
==474== Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

**K. RICH.**
==475== Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
==476== You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
==477== Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.

**STAN.**
==478== No, my good lord, therefore mistrust me not.

**K. RICH.**
==479== Where is thy power then, to beat him back?
==480== Where be thy tenants and thy followers?
==481== Are they not now upon the western shore,
==482== Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?

**STAN.**
==483== No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.

**K. RICH.**
==484== Cold friends to me! What do they in the north,
==485== When they should serve their sovereign in the west?

**STAN.**
==486== They have not been commanded, mighty King.
==487== Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,
==488== I’ll muster up my friends and meet your Grace
==489== Where and what time your Majesty shall please.

**K. RICH.**
==490== Ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond;
==491== But I’ll not trust thee.

**STAN.**
==491==            Most mighty sovereign,
==492== You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
==493== I never was nor never will be false.

**K. RICH.**
==494== Go then, and muster men; but leave behind
==495== Your son, George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,
==496== Or else his head’s assurance is but frail.

**STAN.**
==497== So deal with him as I prove true to you.

*Exit Stanley.*

*Enter First Messenger.*

**1. MESS.**
==498== My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
==499== As I by friends am well advertised,
==500== Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,
==501== Bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,
==502== With many more confederates, are in arms.

*Enter another Messenger.*

**2. MESS.**
==503== In Kent, my liege, the Guilfords are in arms,
==504== And every hour more competitors
==505== Flock to the rebels, and their power grows strong.

*Enter another Messenger.*

**3. MESS.**
==506== My lord, the army of great Buckingham⁠—

**K. RICH.**
==507== Out on you, owls! Nothing but songs of death?
*(He striketh him.)*
==508== There, take thou that, till thou bring better news.

**3. MESS.**
==509== The news I have to tell your Majesty
==510== Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
==511== Buckingham’s army is dispers’d and scatter’d,
==512== And he himself wand’red away alone,
==513== No man knows whither.

**K. RICH.**
==513==               I cry thee mercy;
==514== There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
==515== Hath any well-advised friend proclaim’d
==516== Reward to him that brings the traitor in?

**3. MESS.**
==517== Such proclamation hath been made, my lord.

*Enter another Messenger.*

**4. MESS.**
==518== Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquess Dorset,
==519== ’Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
==520== But this good comfort bring I to your Highness:
==521== The Britain navy is dispers’d by tempest.
==522== Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat
==523== Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
==524== If they were his assistants, yea or no;
==525== Who answer’d him, they came from Buckingham
==526== Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,
==527== Hois’d sail, and made his course again for Britain.

**K. RICH.**
==528== March on, march on, since we are up in arms,
==529== If not to fight with foreign enemies,
==530== Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

*Enter Catesby.*

**CATE.**
==531== My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken⁠—
==532== That is the best news. That the Earl of Richmond
==533== Is with a mighty power landed at Milford
==534== Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

**K. RICH.**
==535== Away towards Salisbury! While we reason here,
==536== A royal battle might be won and lost.
==537== Some one take order Buckingham be brought
==538== To Salisbury, the rest march on with me.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
