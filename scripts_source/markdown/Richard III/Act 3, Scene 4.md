## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*The Tower of London.*

*Enter Buckingham, Stanley, Earl of Derby, Hastings, Bishop of Ely, Norfolk, Ratcliffe, Lovel, with others, at a table.*

**HAST.**
==1==Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met
==2==Is to determine of the coronation.
==3==In God’s name speak, when is the royal day?

**BUCK.**
==4==Is all things ready for the royal time?

**STAN.**
==5==It is, and wants but nomination.

**ELY.**
==6==Tomorrow then I judge a happy day.

**BUCK.**
==7==Who knows the Lord Protector’s mind herein?
==8==Who is most inward with the noble Duke?

**ELY.**
==9==Your Grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.

**BUCK.**
==10==We know each other’s faces; for our hearts,
==11==He knows no more of mine than I of yours,
==12==Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.
==13==Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.

**HAST.**
==14==I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;
==15==But for his purpose in the coronation,
==16==I have not sounded him, nor he deliver’d
==17==His gracious pleasure any way therein.
==18==But you, my honorable lords, may name the time,
==19==And in the Duke’s behalf I’ll give my voice,
==20==Which I presume he’ll take in gentle part.

*Enter Gloucester.*

**ELY.**
==21==In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.

**GLOU.**
==22==My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
==23==I have been long a sleeper; but I trust
==24==My absence doth neglect no great design,
==25==Which by my presence might have been concluded.

**BUCK.**
==26==Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,
==27==William Lord Hastings had pronounc’d your part,
==28==I mean your voice for crowning of the King.

**GLOU.**
==29==Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder,
==30==His lordship knows me well and loves me well.
==31==My Lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn,
==32==I saw good strawberries in your garden there.
==33==I do beseech you send for some of them.

**ELY.**
==34==Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.

*Exit Bishop.*

**GLOU.**
==35==Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
*(Drawing him aside.)*
==36==Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
==37==And finds the testy gentleman so hot
==38==That he will lose his head ere give consent
==39==His master’s child, as worshipfully he terms it,
==40==Shall lose the royalty of England’s throne.

**BUCK.**
==41==Withdraw yourself a while, I’ll go with you.

*Exeunt Gloucester and Buckingham.*

**STAN.**
==42==We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
==43==Tomorrow, in my judgment, is too sudden,
==44==For I myself am not so well provided
==45==As else I would be, were the day prolong’d.

*Enter the Bishop of Ely.*

**ELY.**
==46==Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?
==47==I have sent for these strawberries.

**HAST.**
==48==His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning;
==49==There’s some conceit or other likes him well,
==50==When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.
==51==I think there’s never a man in Christendom
==52==Can lesser hide his love or hate than he,
==53==For by his face straight shall you know his heart.

**STAN.**
==54==What of his heart perceive you in his face
==55==By any livelihood he show’d today?

**HAST.**
==56==Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
==57==For were he, he had shown it in his looks.

**STAN.**
==58==I pray God he be not, I say.

*Enter Richard of Gloucester and Buckingham*

**GLOU.**
==59==I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
==60==That do conspire my death with devilish plots
==61==Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail’d
==62==Upon my body with their hellish charms?

**HAST.**
==63==The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,
==64==Makes me most forward in this princely presence
==65==To doom th’ offenders, whosoe’er they be:
==66==I say, my lord, they have deserved death.

**GLOU.**
==67==Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.
==68==Look how I am bewitch’d; behold, mine arm
==69==Is like a blasted sapling, wither’d up;
==70==And this is Edward’s wife, that monstrous witch,
==71==Consorted with that harlot, strumpet Shore,
==72==That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.

**HAST.**
==73==If they have done this deed, my noble lord⁠—

**GLOU.**
==74==If? Thou protector of this damned strumpet,
==75==Talk’st thou to me of “ifs”? Thou art a traitor.
==76==Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear
==77==I will not dine until I see the same.
==78==Lovel and Ratcliffe, look that it be done:
==79==The rest that love me, rise, and follow me.

*Exeunt. Manent Lovel and Ratcliffe with the Lord Hastings.*

**HAST.**
==80==Woe, woe for England, not a whit for me!
==81==For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
==82==Stanley did dream the boar did rase our helms,
==83==And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.
==84==Three times today my foot-cloth horse did scumble,
==85==And started when he look’d upon the Tower,
==86==As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
==87==O now I need the priest that spake to me!
==88==I now repent I told the pursuivant,
==89==As too triumphing, how mine enemies
==90==Today at Pomfret bloodily were butcher’d,
==91==And I myself secure, in grace and favor.
==92==O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
==93==Is lighted on poor Hastings’ wretched head!

**RAT.**
==94==Come, come, dispatch, the Duke would be at dinner,
==95==Make a short shrift, he longs to see your head.

**HAST.**
==96==O momentary grace of mortal men,
==97==Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
==98==Who builds his hope in air of your good looks
==99==Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
==100==Ready with every nod to tumble down
==101==Into the fatal bowels of the deep.

**LOV.**
==102==Come, come, dispatch, ’tis bootless to exclaim.

**HAST.**
==103==O bloody Richard! Miserable England!
==104==I prophesy the fearfull’st time to thee
==105==That ever wretched age hath look’d upon.
==106==Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
==107==They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.

*Exeunt.*
