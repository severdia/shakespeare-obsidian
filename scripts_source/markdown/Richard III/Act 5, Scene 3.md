## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Bosworth Field.*

*Enter at one door King Richard, in arms, with Norfolk, Ratcliffe, and the Earl of Surrey, with others.*

**K. RICH.**
==1== Here pitch our tent, even here in Bosworth field.
==2== My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?

**SUR.**
==3== My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.

**K. RICH.**
==4== My Lord of Norfolk⁠—

**NOR.**
==5== Here, most gracious liege.

**K. RICH.**
==6== Norfolk, we must have knocks. Ha, must we not?

**NOR.**
==7== We must both give and take, my loving lord.

**K. RICH.**
==8== Up with my tent! Here will I lie tonight
*(Soldiers begin to set up the King’s tent.)*
==9== But where tomorrow? Well, all’s one for that.
==10== Who hath descried the number of the traitors?

**NOR.**
==11== Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.

**K. RICH.**
==12== Why, our battalia trebles that account;
==13== Besides, the King’s name is a tower of strength,
==14== Which they upon the adverse faction want.
==15== Up with the tent! Come, noble gentlemen,
==16== Let us survey the vantage of the ground.
==17== Call for some men of sound direction:
==18== Let’s lack no discipline, make no delay,
==19== For, lords, tomorrow is a busy day.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter at the other door Richmond, Sir William Brandon, Oxford, and Dorset, Blunt, Herbert, and others. Some of the soldiers pitch Richmond’s tent.*

**RICHM.**
==20== The weary sun hath made a golden set,
==21== And by the bright tract of his fiery car
==22== Gives token of a goodly day tomorrow.
==23== Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
==24== Give me some ink and paper in my tent;
==25== I’ll draw the form and model of our battle,
==26== Limit each leader to his several charge,
==27== And part in just proportion our small power.
==28== My Lord of Oxford—you, Sir William Brandon⁠—
==29== And you, Sir Walter Herbert—stay with me.
==30== The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment;
==31== Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
==32== And by the second hour in the morning
==33== Desire the Earl to see me in my tent.
==34== Yet one thing more, good captain, do for me⁠—
==35== Where is Lord Stanley quarter’d, do you know?

**BLUNT.**
==36== Unless I have mista’en his colors much
==37== (Which well I am assur’d I have not done),
==38== His regiment lies half a mile at least
==39== South from the mighty power of the King.

**RICHM.**
==40== If without peril it be possible,
==41== Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him,
==42== And give him from me this most needful note.

**BLUNT.**
==43== Upon my life, my lord, I’ll undertake it,
==44== And so God give you quiet rest tonight!

**RICHM.**
==45== Good night, good Captain Blunt.
*(Exit Blunt.)*
==45==                   Come, gentlemen,
==46== Let us consult upon tomorrow’s business.
==47== In to my tent, the dew is raw and cold.

*They withdraw into the tent.*

*Enter to his tent King Richard, Ratcliffe, Norfolk, and Catesby.*

**K. RICH.**
==48== What is’t a’ clock?

**CATE.**
==48==            It’s supper-time, my lord,
==49== It’s nine a’ clock.

**K. RICH.**
==49==            I will not sup tonight.
==50== Give me some ink and paper.
==51== What? Is my beaver easier than it was?
==52== And all my armor laid into my tent?

**CATE.**
==53== It is, my liege, and all things are in readiness.

**K. RICH.**
==54== Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge,
==55== Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.

**NOR.**
==56== I go, my lord.

**K. RICH.**
==57== Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Norfolk.

**NOR.**
==58== I warrant you, my lord.

*Exit.*

**K. RICH.**
==59== Catesby!

**CATE.**
==60== My lord?

**K. RICH.**
==60==     Send out a pursuivant-at-arms
==61== To Stanley’s regiment, bid him bring his power
==62== Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
==63== Into the blind cave of eternal night.
*(Exit Catesby.)*
==64== Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
==65== Saddle white Surrey for the field tomorrow.
==66== Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
==67== Ratcliffe!

**RAT.**
==68== My lord?

**K. RICH.**
==69== Saw’st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?

**RAT.**
==70== Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,
==71== Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
==72== Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.

**K. RICH.**
==73== So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.
==74== I have not that alacrity of spirit
==75== Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.
*(Wine brought.)*
==76== Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?

**RAT.**
==77== It is, my lord.

**K. RICH.**
==77==         Bid my guard watch; leave me.
==78== Ratcliffe, about the mid of night come to my tent
==79== And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.

*Exit Ratcliffe. Richard sleeps.*

*Enter Stanley the Earl of Derby to Richmond in his tent, Lords and others attending.*

**STAN.**
==80== Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!

**RICHM.**
==81== All comfort that the dark night can afford
==82== Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
==83== Tell me, how fares our loving mother?

**STAN.**
==84== I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
==85== Who prays continually for Richmond’s good.
==86== So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
==87== And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
==88== In brief—for so the season bids us be⁠—
==89== Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
==90== And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
==91== Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
==92== I, as I may—that which I would I cannot⁠—
==93== With best advantage will deceive the time,
==94== And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms;
==95== But on thy side I may not be too forward,
==96== Lest being seen, thy brother, tender George,
==97== Be executed in his father’s sight.
==98== Farewell! The leisure and the fearful time
==99== Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
==100== And ample interchange of sweet discourse
==101== Which so long sund’red friends should dwell upon.
==102== God give us leisure for these rites of love!
==103== Once more, *adieu*! Be valiant, and speed well!

**RICHM.**
==104== Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.
==105== I’ll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,
==106== Lest leaden slumber peize me down tomorrow,
==107== When I should mount with wings of victory.
==108== Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
*(Exeunt. Manet Richmond.)*
==109== O Thou whose captain I account myself,
==110== Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
==111== Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
==112== That they may crush down with a heavy fall
==113== The usurping helmets of our adversaries;
==114== Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
==115== That we may praise thee in the victory!
==116== To thee I do commend my watchful soul
==117== Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
==118== Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

*Sleeps.*

*Enter the Ghost of young Prince Edward of Lancaster, son to Henry the Sixth, to Richard.*

**GHOST OF ED.**
*(To Richard.)*
==119== Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow!
==120== Think how thou stab’st me in my prime of youth
==121== At Tewksbury. Despair therefore and die!
*(To Richmond.)*
==122== Be cheerful, Richmond, for the wronged souls
==123== Of butchered princes fight in thy behalf.
==124== King Henry’s issue, Richmond, comforts thee.

*Enter the Ghost of King Henry the Sixth.*

**GHOST OF HENRY.**
*(To Richard.)*
==125== When I was mortal, my anointed body
==126== By thee was punched full of deadly holes.
==127== Think on the Tower and me. Despair and die!
==128== Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.
*(To Richmond.)*
==129== Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!
==130== Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be king,
==131== Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish!

*Enter the Ghost of Clarence.*

**GHOST OF C.**
*(To Richard.)*
==132== Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow,
==133== I that was wash’d to death with fulsome wine,
==134== Poor Clarence, by thy guile betray’d to death!
==135== Tomorrow in the battle think on me,
==136== And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!
*(To Richmond.)*
==137== Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,
==138== The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee.
==139== Good angels guard thy battle! Live and flourish!

*Enter the Ghosts of Rivers, Grey, Vaughan.*

**GHOST OF R.**
*(To Richard.)*
==140== Let me sit heavy in thy soul tomorrow,
==141== Rivers, that died at Pomfret! Despair and die!

**GHOST OF G.**
*(To Richard.)*
==142== Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!

**GHOST OF V.**
*(To Richard.)*
==143== Think upon Vaughan, and with guilty fear
==144== Let fall thy lance. Despair and die!

**ALL GHOSTS**
*(To Richmond.)*
==145== Awake and think our wrongs in Richard’s bosom
==146== Will conquer him! Awake and win the day!

*Enter the Ghosts of the two young Princes.*

**GHOSTS. PRINC.**
*(To Richard.)*
==147== Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower.
==148== Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,
==149== And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!
==150== Thy nephews’ souls bid thee despair and die!
*(To Richmond.)*
==151== Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace and wake in joy.
==152== Good angels guard thee from the boar’s annoy!
==153== Live and beget a happy race of kings!
==154== Edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.

*Enter the Ghost of Hastings.*

**GHOST OF H.**
*(To Richard.)*
==155== Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,
==156== And in a bloody battle end thy days!
==157== Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die!
*(To Richmond.)*
==158== Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!
==159== Arm, fight, and conquer for fair England’s sake!

*Enter the Ghost of Lady Anne, his wife.*

**GHOST OF LADY**
*(To Richard.)*
==160== Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,
==161== That never slept a quiet hour with thee,
==162== Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
==163== Tomorrow in the battle think on me,
==164== And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!
*(To Richmond.)*
==165== Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep,
==166== Dream of success and happy victory!
==167== Thy adversary’s wife doth pray for thee.

*Enter the Ghost of Buckingham.*

**GHOST OF BUCK.**
*(To Richard.)*
==168== The first was I that help’d thee to the crown;
==169== The last was I that felt thy tyranny.
==170== O, in the battle think on Buckingham,
==171== And die in terror of thy guiltiness!
==172== Dream on, dream on, of bloody deeds and death;
==173== Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
*(To Richmond.)*
==174== I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid,
==175== But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay’d.
==176== God and good angels fight on Richmond’s side,
==177== And Richard falls in height of all his pride!

*The Ghosts vanish. Richard starteth up out of a dream.*

**K. RICH.**
==178== Give me another horse! Bind up my wounds!
==179== Have mercy, Jesu! Soft, I did but dream.
==180== O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
==181== The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
==182== Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
==183== What do I fear? Myself? There’s none else by.
==184== Richard loves Richard, that is, I am I.
==185== Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am.
==186== Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why⁠—
==187== Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
==188== Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good
==189== That I myself have done unto myself?
==190== O no! Alas, I rather hate myself
==191== For hateful deeds committed by myself.
==192== I am a villain; yet I lie, I am not.
==193== Fool, of thyself speak well; fool, do not flatter:
==194== My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
==195== And every tongue brings in a several tale,
==196== And every tale condemns me for a villain.
==197== Perjury, perjury, in the highest degree;
==198== Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree;
==199== All several sins, all us’d in each degree,
==200== Throng to the bar, crying all, “Guilty! Guilty!”
==201== I shall despair; there is no creature loves me,
==202== And if I die no soul will pity me.
==203== And wherefore should they, since that I myself
==204== Find in myself no pity to myself?
==205== Methought the souls of all that I had murder’d
==206== Came to my tent, and every one did threat
==207== Tomorrow’s vengeance on the head of Richard.

*Enter Ratcliffe.*

**RAT.**
==208== My lord!

**K. RICH.**
==209== ’Zounds, who is there?

**RAT.**
==210== Ratcliffe, my lord, ’tis I. The early village cock
==211== Hath twice done salutation to the morn,
==212== Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.

**K. RICH.**
==213== O Ratcliffe, I have dream’d a fearful dream!
==214== What think’st thou—will our friends prove all true?

**RAT.**
==215== No doubt, my lord.

**K. RICH.**
==215==            O Ratcliffe, I fear, I fear!

**RAT.**
==216== Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.

**K. RICH.**
==217== By the apostle Paul, shadows tonight
==218== Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
==219== Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
==220== Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.
==221== ’Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me,
==222== Under our tents I’ll play the ease-dropper,
==223== To see if any mean to shrink from me.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter the Lords to Richmond sitting in his tent.*

**1. LORD. RICH.**
==224== Good morrow, Richmond!

**RICHM.**
==225== Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
==226== That you have ta’en a tardy sluggard here.

**2. LORD. RICH.**
==227== How have you slept, my lord?

**RICHM.**
==228== The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
==229== That ever ent’red in a drowsy head
==230== Have I since your departure had, my lords.
==231== Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder’d
==232== Came to my tent and cried on victory.
==233== I promise you, my soul is very jocund
==234== In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
==235== How far into the morning is it, lords?

**1. LORD. RICH.**
==236== Upon the stroke of four.

**RICHM.**
==237== Why, then ’tis time to arm and give direction.
*(His oration to his Soldiers.)*
==238== More than I have said, loving countrymen,
==239== The leisure and enforcement of the time
==240== Forbids to dwell upon, yet remember this:
==241== God and our good cause fight upon our side;
==242== The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
==243== Like high-rear’d bulwarks, stand before our faces.
==244== Richard except, those whom we fight against
==245== Had rather have us win than him they follow:
==246== For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
==247== A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
==248== One rais’d in blood, and one in blood established;
==249== One that made means to come by what he hath,
==250== And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;
==251== A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
==252== Of England’s chair, where he is falsely set;
==253== One that hath ever been God’s enemy.
==254== Then if you fight against God’s enemy,
==255== God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
==256== If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
==257== You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
==258== If you do fight against your country’s foes,
==259== Your country’s fat shall pay your pains the hire;
==260== If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
==261== Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
==262== If you do free your children from the sword,
==263== Your children’s children quits it in your age.
==264== Then in the name of God and all these rights,
==265== Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
==266== For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
==267== Shall be this cold corpse on the earth’s cold face;
==268== But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
==269== The least of you shall share his part thereof.
==270== Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully.
==271== God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!

*Exeunt.*

*Enter King Richard, Ratcliffe, Attendants, and forces.*

**K. RICH.**
==272== What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?

**RAT.**
==273== That he was never trained up in arms.

**K. RICH.**
==274== He said the truth, and what said Surrey then?

**RAT.**
==275== He smil’d and said, “The better for our purpose.”

**K. RICH.**
==276== He was in the right, and so indeed it is.
*(The clock striketh.)*
==277== Tell the clock there. Give me a calendar.
==278== Who saw the sun today?

**RAT.**
==278==               Not I, my lord.

**K. RICH.**
==279== Then he disdains to shine, for by the book
==280== He should have brav’d the east an hour ago.
==281== A black day will it be to somebody.
==282== Ratcliffe!

**RAT.**
==283== My lord?

**K. RICH.**
==283==     The sun will not be seen today,
==284== The sky doth frown and low’r upon our army.
==285== I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
==286== Not shine today? Why, what is that to me
==287== More than to Richmond? For the self-same heaven
==288== That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.

*Enter Norfolk.*

**NOR.**
==289== Arm, arm, my lord, the foe vaunts in the field.

**K. RICH.**
==290== Come, bustle, bustle! Caparison my horse!
==291== Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.
==292== I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
==293== And thus my battle shall be ordered:
==294== My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
==295== Consisting equally of horse and foot;
==296== Our archers shall be placed in the midst;
==297== John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
==298== Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
==299== They thus directed, we will follow
==300== In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
==301== Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
==302== This, and Saint George to boot! What think’st thou, Norfolk?

**NOR.**
==303== A good direction, warlike sovereign.
*(He sheweth him a paper.)*
==304== This found I on my tent this morning.
*(Reads.)*
==305== *“Jockey of Norfolk, be not so bold,*
==306== *For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.”*

**K. RICH.**
==307== A thing devised by the enemy.
==308== Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge.
==309== Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;
==310== Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
==311== Devis’d at first to keep the strong in awe:
==312== Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law!
==313== March on, join bravely, let us to it pell-mell;
==314== If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
*(His oration to his Army.)*
==315== What shall I say more than I have inferr’d?
==316== Remember whom you are to cope withal:
==317== A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
==318== A scum of Britains and base lackey peasants,
==319== Whom their o’ercloyed country vomits forth
==320== To desperate adventures and assur’d destruction.
==321== You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
==322== You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
==323== They would restrain the one, distain the other.
==324== And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
==325== Long kept in Britain at our mother’s cost?
==326== A milksop, one that never in his life
==327== Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
==328== Let’s whip these stragglers o’er the seas again;
==329== Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
==330== These famish’d beggars weary of their lives,
==331== Who (but for dreaming on this fond exploit) 
==332== For want of means, poor rats, had hang’d themselves.
==333== If we be conquered, let men conquer us,
==334== And not these bastard Britains, whom our fathers
==335== Have in their own land beaten, bobb’d, and thump’d,
==336== And in record left them the heirs of shame.
==337== Shall these enjoy our lands? Lie with our wives?
==338== Ravish our daughters?
*(Drum afar off.)*
==338==               Hark, I hear their drum.
==339== Fight, gentlemen of England! Fight, bold yeomen!
==340== Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
==341== Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
==342== Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
*(Enter a Messenger.)*
==343== What says Lord Stanley? Will he bring his power?

**5. MESS.**
==344== My lord, he doth deny to come.

**K. RICH.**
==345== Off with his son George’s head!

**NOR.**
==346== My lord, the enemy is past the marsh,
==347== After the battle let George Stanley die.

**K. RICH.**
==348== A thousand hearts are great within my bosom.
==349== Advance our standards, set upon our foes.
==350== Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
==351== Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
==352== Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.

*Exeunt.*
