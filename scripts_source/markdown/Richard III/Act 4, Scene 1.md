## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 7|← Act 3, Scene 7]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Outside the Tower.*

*Enter the Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of York, and Marquess Dorset at one door; Anne Duchess of Gloucester leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet, Clarence’s young daughter, at another door.*

**DUCH.**
==1==Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet,
==2==Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
==3==Now, for my life, she’s wand’ring to the Tower,
==4==On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender Prince.
==5==Daughter, well met.

**ANNE.**
==5==           God give your Graces both
==6==A happy and a joyful time of day!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==7==As much to you, good sister! Whither away?

**ANNE.**
==8==No farther than the Tower, and as I guess,
==9==Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
==10==To gratulate the gentle Princes there.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==11==Kind sister, thanks, we’ll enter all together.
*(Enter the Lieutenant Brakenbury.)*
==12==And in good time, here the Lieutenant comes.
==13==Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
==14==How doth the Prince and my young son of York?

**BRAK.**
==15==Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
==16==I may not suffer you to visit them,
==17==The King hath strictly charg’d the contrary.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==18==The King? Who’s that?

**BRAK.**
==18==              I mean the Lord Protector.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==19==The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
==20==Hath he set bounds between their love and me?
==21==I am their mother, who shall bar me from them?

**DUCH.**
==22==I am their father’s mother, I will see them.

**ANNE.**
==23==Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother;
==24==Then bring me to their sights. I’ll bear thy blame,
==25==And take thy office from thee on my peril.

**BRAK.**
==26==No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
==27==I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.

*Exit Lieutenant.*

*Enter Stanley.*

**STAN.**
==28==Let me but meet you, ladies, an hour hence,
==29==And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother
==30==And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.
*(To Anne.)*
==31==Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
==32==There to be crowned Richard’s royal queen.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==33==Ah, cut my lace asunder,
==34==That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
==35==Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!

**ANNE.**
==36==Despiteful tidings, O unpleasing news!

**DOR.**
==37==Be of good cheer. Mother, how fares your Grace?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==38==O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee gone!
==39==Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;
==40==Thy mother’s name is ominous to children.
==41==If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
==42==And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.
==43==Go hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
==44==Lest thou increase the number of the dead,
==45==And make me die the thrall of Margaret’s curse,
==46==Nor mother, wife, nor England’s counted queen.

**STAN.**
==47==Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam;
==48==Take all the swift advantage of the hours.
==49==You shall have letters from me to my son
==50==In your behalf, to meet you on the way.
==51==Be not ta’en tardy by unwise delay.

**DUCH.**
==52==O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
==53==O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
==54==A cockatrice hast thou hatch’d to the world,
==55==Whose unavoided eye is murderous.

**STAN.**
==56==Come, madam, come, I in all haste was sent.

**ANNE.**
==57==And I with all unwillingness will go.
==58==O would to God that the inclusive verge
==59==Of golden metal that must round my brow
==60==Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains!
==61==Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
==62==And die ere men can say, “God save the Queen!”

**Q. ELIZ.**
==63==Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory,
==64==To feed my humor wish thyself no harm.

**ANNE.**
==65==No! Why? When he that is my husband now
==66==Came to me as I follow’d Henry’s corse,
==67==When scarce the blood was well wash’d from his hands
==68==Which issued from my other angel husband,
==69==And that dear saint which then I weeping follow’d⁠—
==70==O, when, I say, I look’d on Richard’s face,
==71==This was my wish: “Be thou,” quoth I, “accurs’d
==72==For making me, so young, so old a widow!
==73==And when thou wed’st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
==74==And be thy wife—if any be so mad⁠—
==75==More miserable by the life of thee
==76==Than thou hast made me by my dear lord’s death!”
==77==Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
==78==Within so small a time, my woman’s heart
==79==Grossly grew captive to his honey words,
==80==And prov’d the subject of mine own soul’s curse,
==81==Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;
==82==For never yet one hour in his bed
==83==Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
==84==But with his timorous dreams was still awak’d.
==85==Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick,
==86==And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==87==Poor heart, *adieu*, I pity thy complaining.

**ANNE.**
==88==No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.

**DOR.**
==89==Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!

**ANNE.**
==90==*Adieu*, poor soul, that tak’st thy leave of it!

**DUCH.**
*(To Dorset.)*
==91==Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
*(To Anne.)*
==92==Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee!
*(To Queen Elizabeth.)*
==93==Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
==94==I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
==95==Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
==96==And each hour’s joy wrack’d with a week of teen.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==97==Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
==98==Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
==99==Whom envy hath immur’d within your walls⁠—
==100==Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
==101==Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
==102==For tender princes—use my babies well!
==103==So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.

*Exeunt.*
