## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*London. The Tower.*

*Enter Clarence and Keeper.*

**KEEP.**
==1== Why looks your Grace so heavily today?

**CLAR.**
==2== O, I have pass’d a miserable night,
==3== So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
==4== That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
==5== I would not spend another such a night
==6== Though ’twere to buy a world of happy days⁠—
==7== So full of dismal terror was the time.

**KEEP.**
==8== What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.

**CLAR.**
==9== Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower
==10== And was embark’d to cross to Burgundy,
==11== And in my company my brother Gloucester,
==12== Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
==13== Upon the hatches. Thence we look’d toward England,
==14== And cited up a thousand heavy times,
==15== During the wars of York and Lancaster,
==16== That had befall’n us. As we pac’d along
==17== Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
==18== Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
==19== Struck me (that thought to stay him) overboard
==20== Into the tumbling billows of the main.
==21== O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown!
==22== What dreadful noise of waters in my ears!
==23== What sights of ugly death within my eyes!
==24== Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks;
==25== A thousand men that fishes gnaw’d upon;
==26== Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
==27== Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
==28== All scatt’red in the bottom of the sea:
==29== Some lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes
==30== Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept
==31== (As ’twere in scorn of eyes) reflecting gems,
==32== That woo’d the slimy bottom of the deep,
==33== And mock’d the dead bones that lay scatt’red by.

**KEEP.**
==34== Had you such leisure in the time of death
==35== To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?

**CLAR.**
==36== Methought I had, and often did I strive
==37== To yield the ghost; but still the envious flood
==38== Stopp’d in my soul, and would not let it forth
==39== To find the empty, vast, and wand’ring air,
==40== But smother’d it within my panting bulk,
==41== Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.

**KEEP.**
==42== Awak’d you not in this sore agony?

**CLAR.**
==43== No, no, my dream was lengthen’d after life.
==44== O then began the tempest to my soul!
==45== I pass’d (methought) the melancholy flood,
==46== With that sour ferryman which poets write of,
==47== Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
==48== The first that there did greet my stranger soul
==49== Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
==50== Who spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury
==51== Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?”
==52== And so he vanish’d. Then came wand’ring by
==53== A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
==54== Dabbled in blood, and he shriek’d out aloud,
==55== “Clarence is come—false, fleeting, perjur’d Clarence,
==56== That stabb’d me in the field by Tewksbury:
==57== Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!”
==58== With that (methoughts) a legion of foul fiends
==59== Environ’d me, and howled in mine ears
==60== Such hideous cries that with the very noise
==61== I, trembling, wak’d, and for a season after
==62== Could not believe but that I was in hell,
==63== Such terrible impression made my dream.

**KEEP.**
==64== No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;
==65== I am afraid (methinks) to hear you tell it.

**KEEP.**
==66== Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things
==67== (That now give evidence against my soul) 
==68== For Edward’s sake, and see how he requites me!
==69== O God! If my deep pray’rs cannot appease thee,
==70== But thou wilt be aveng’d on my misdeeds,
==71== Yet execute thy wrath in me alone!
==72== O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
==73== Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile.
==74== My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

**KEEP.**
==75== I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest!

*Clarence sleeps.*

*Enter Brakenbury, the Lieutenant.*

**BRAK.**
==76== Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
==77== Makes the night morning and the noontide night:
==78== Princes have but their titles for their glories,
==79== An outward honor for an inward toil,
==80== And for unfelt imaginations
==81== They often feel a world of restless cares;
==82== So that between their titles and low name
==83== There’s nothing differs but the outward fame.

*Enter two Murderers.*

**1. MUR.**
==84== Ho, who’s here?

**BRAK.**
==85== What wouldst thou, fellow? And how cam’st thou hither?

**1. MUR.**
==86== I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.

**BRAK.**
==87== What, so brief?

**2. MUR.**
==88== ’Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let him see our commission, and talk no more.

*Brakenbury reads it.*

**BRAK.**
==89== I am in this commanded to deliver
==90== The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.
==91== I will not reason what is meant hereby,
==92== Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.
==93== There lies the Duke asleep, and there the keys.
==94== I’ll to the King and signify to him
==95== That thus I have resign’d to you my charge.

**1. MUR.**
==96== You may, sir, ’tis a point of wisdom. Fare you well.

*Exit Brakenbury with Keeper.*

**2. MUR.**
==97== What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?

**1. MUR.**
==98== No, he’ll say ’twas done cowardly when he wakes.

**2. MUR.**
==99== Why, he shall never wake until the great Judgment Day.

**1. MUR.**
==100== Why, then he’ll say we stabb’d him sleeping.

**2. MUR.**
==101== The urging of that word “judgment” hath bred a kind of remorse in me.

**1. MUR.**
==102== What? Art thou afraid?

**2. MUR.**
==103== Not to kill him, having a warrant, but to be damn’d for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.

**1. MUR.**
==104== I thought thou hadst been resolute.

**2. MUR.**
==105== So I am—to let him live.

**1. MUR.**
==106== I’ll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so.

**2. MUR.**
==107== Nay, I prithee stay a little. I hope this passionate humor of mine will change. It was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.

**1. MUR.**
==108== How dost thou feel thyself now?

**2. MUR.**
==109== Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.

**1. MUR.**
==110== Remember our reward when the deed’s done.

**2. MUR.**
==111== ’Zounds, he dies! I had forgot the reward.

**1. MUR.**
==112== Where’s thy conscience now?

**2. MUR.**
==113== O, in the Duke of Gloucester’s purse.

**1. MUR.**
==114== When he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.

**2. MUR.**
==115== ’Tis no matter, let it go. There’s few or none will entertain it.

**1. MUR.**
==116== What if it come to thee again?

**2. MUR.**
==117== I’ll not meddle with it, it makes a man a coward. A man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbor’s wife, but it detects him. ’Tis a blushing shame-fac’d spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom. It fills a man full of obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold that (by chance) I found. It beggars any man that keeps it. It is turn’d out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing, and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.

**1. MUR.**
==118== ’Zounds, ’tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the Duke.

**2. MUR.**
==119== Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.

**1. MUR.**
==120== I am strong-fram’d, he cannot prevail with me.

**2. MUR.**
==121== Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?

**1. MUR.**
==122== Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then throw him into the malmsey-butt in the next room.

**2. MUR.**
==123== O excellent device! And make a sop of him.

**1. MUR.**
==124== Soft, he wakes.

**2. MUR.**
==125== Strike!

**1. MUR.**
==126== No, we’ll reason with him.

**CLAR.**
==127== Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.

**2. MUR.**
==128== You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.

**CLAR.**
==129== In God’s name, what art thou?

**1. MUR.**
==130== A man, as you are.

**CLAR.**
==131== But not, as I am, royal.

**2. MUR.**
==132== Nor you, as we are, loyal.

**CLAR.**
==133== Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

**1. MUR.**
==134== My voice is now the King’s, my looks mine own.

**CLAR.**
==135== How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
==136== Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?
==137== Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

**BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.**
==138== To, to, to⁠—

**CLAR.**
==139== To murder me?

**BOTH 1. MUR. AND 2. MUR.**
==140== Ay, ay.

**CLAR.**
==141== You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
==142== And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
==143== Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

**1. MUR.**
==144== Offended us you have not, but the King.

**CLAR.**
==145== I shall be reconcil’d to him again.

**2. MUR.**
==146== Never, my lord, therefore prepare to die.

**CLAR.**
==147== Are you drawn forth among a world of men
==148== To slay the innocent? What is my offense?
==149== Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?
==150== What lawful quest have given their verdict up
==151== Unto the frowning judge? Or who pronounc’d
==152== The bitter sentence of poor Clarence’ death?
==153== Before I be convict by course of law,
==154== To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
==155== I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
==156== By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
==157== That you depart, and lay no hands on me.
==158== The deed you undertake is damnable.

**1. MUR.**
==159== What we will do, we do upon command.

**2. MUR.**
==160== And he that hath commanded is our King.

**CLAR.**
==161== Erroneous vassals, the great King of kings
==162== Hath in the table of his law commanded
==163== That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then
==164== Spurn at his edict, and fulfill a man’s?
==165== Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand,
==166== To hurl upon their heads that break his law.

**2. MUR.**
==167== And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
==168== For false forswearing and for murder too.
==169== Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight
==170== In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.

**1. MUR.**
==171== And like a traitor to the name of God
==172== Didst break that vow, and with thy treacherous blade
==173== Unrip’st the bowels of thy sov’reign’s son.

**2. MUR.**
==174== Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.

**1. MUR.**
==175== How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us,
==176== When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?

**CLAR.**
==177== Alas! For whose sake did I that ill deed?
==178== For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.
==179== He sends you not to murder me for this,
==180== For in that sin he is as deep as I.
==181== If God will be avenged for the deed,
==182== O, know you yet he doth it publicly.
==183== Take not the quarrel from his pow’rful arm;
==184== He needs no indirect or lawless course
==185== To cut off those that have offended him.

**1. MUR.**
==186== Who made thee then a bloody minister,
==187== When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
==188== That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?

**CLAR.**
==189== My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.

**1. MUR.**
==190== Thy brother’s love, our duty, and thy faults
==191== Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.

**CLAR.**
==192== O, if you love my brother, hate not me!
==193== I am his brother and I love him well.
==194== If you are hir’d for meed, go back again,
==195== And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
==196== Who shall reward you better for my life
==197== Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

**2. MUR.**
==198== You are deceiv’d, your brother Gloucester hates you.

**CLAR.**
==199== O no; he loves me and he holds me dear.
==200== Go you to him from me.

**1. MUR.**
==200==               Ay, so we will.

**CLAR.**
==201== Tell him, when that our princely father York
==202== Blest his three sons with his victorious arm,
==203== And charg’d us from his soul to love each other,) 
==204== He little thought of this divided friendship.
==205== Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

**1. MUR.**
==206== Ay, millstones, as he lesson’d us to weep.

**CLAR.**
==207== O, do not slander him, for he is kind.

**1. MUR.**
==208== Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you deceive yourself,
==209== ’Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.

**CLAR.**
==210== It cannot be, for he bewept my fortune,
==211== And hugg’d me in his arms, and swore with sobs
==212== That he would labor my delivery.

**1. MUR.**
==213== Why, so he doth, when he delivers you
==214== From this earth’s thralldom to the joys of heaven.

**2. MUR.**
==215== Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

**CLAR.**
==216== Have you that holy feeling in your souls
==217== To counsel me to make my peace with God,
==218== And are you yet to your own souls so blind
==219== That you will war with God by murd’ring me?
==220== O, sirs, consider, they that set you on
==221== To do this deed will hate you for the deed.

**2. MUR.**
==222== What shall we do?

**CLAR.**
==222==            Relent, and save your souls.
==223== Which of you, if you were a prince’s son,
==224== Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
==225== If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
==226== Would not entreat for life?

**1. MUR.**
==227== Relent? No: ’tis cowardly and womanish.

**CLAR.**
==228== Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
==229== My friend
*(To Second Murderer)*
==229==         I spy some pity in thy looks.
==230== O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
==231== Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
==232== As you would beg, were you in my distress.
==233== A begging prince what beggar pities not?

**2. MUR.**
==234== Look behind you, my lord.

**1. MUR.**
==235== Take that! And that!
*(Stabs him.)*
==235==            If all this will not do,
==236== I’ll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

*Exit with the body.*

**2. MUR.**
==237== A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch’d!
==238== How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
==239== Of this most grievous murder!

*Enter First Murderer.*

**1. MUR.**
==240== How now? What mean’st thou, that thou help’st me not?
==241== By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have been!

**2. MUR.**
==242== I would he knew that I had sav’d his brother!
==243== Take thou the fee and tell him what I say,
==244== For I repent me that the Duke is slain.

*Exit.*

**1. MUR.**
==245== So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.
==246== Well, I’ll go hide the body in some hole
==247== Till that the Duke give order for his burial;
==248== And when I have my meed, I will away,
==249== For this will out, and then I must not stay.

*Exit.*
