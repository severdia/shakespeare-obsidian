## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Pomfret Castle.*

*Enter Sir Richard Ratcliffe with Halberdiers, carrying the nobles Rivers, Grey, and Vaughan to death at Pomfret.*

**RAT.**
==1==Come, bring forth the prisoners.

**RIV.**
==2==Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this:
==3==Today shalt thou behold a subject die
==4==For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.

**GREY.**
==5==God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!
==6==A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.

**VAUG.**
==7==You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.

**RAT.**
==8==Dispatch, the limit of your lives is out.

**RIV.**
==9==O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison!
==10==Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
==11==Within the guilty closure of thy walls
==12==Richard the Second here was hack’d to death;
==13==And for more slander to thy dismal seat,
==14==We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.

**GREY.**
==15==Now Margaret’s curse is fall’n upon our heads,
==16==When she exclaim’d on Hastings, you, and I,
==17==For standing by when Richard stabb’d her son.

**RIV.**
==18==Then curs’d she Richard, then curs’d she Buckingham,
==19==Then curs’d she Hastings. O, remember, God,
==20==To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!
==21==And for my sister and her princely sons,
==22==Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
==23==Which, as thou know’st, unjustly must be spilt.

**RAT.**
==24==Make haste, the hour of death is expiate.

**RIV.**
==25==Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us here embrace.
==26==Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.

*Exeunt.*
