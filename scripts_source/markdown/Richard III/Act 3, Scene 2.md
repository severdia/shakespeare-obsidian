## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Before Lord Hastings’ house.*

*Enter a Messenger to the door of Hastings.*

**STAN. MESS.**
==1== My lord! My lord!

**HAST.**
*(Within.)*
==2== Who knocks?

**STAN. MESS.**
==3== One from the Lord Stanley.

**HAST.**
*(Within.)*
==4== What is’t a’ clock?

**STAN. MESS.**
==5== Upon the stroke of four.

*Enter Lord Hastings.*

**HAST.**
==6== Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights?

**STAN. MESS.**
==7== So it appears by that I have to say:
==8== First, he commends him to your noble self.

**HAST.**
==9== What then?

**STAN. MESS.**
==10== Then certifies your lordship that this night
==11== He dreamt the boar had rased off his helm.
==12== Besides, he says there are two Councils kept;
==13== And that may be determin’d at the one
==14== Which may make you and him to rue at th’ other.
==15== Therefore he sends to know your lordship’s pleasure,
==16== If you will presently take horse with him,
==17== And with all speed post with him toward the north,
==18== To shun the danger that his soul divines.

**HAST.**
==19== Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord,
==20== Bid him not fear the separated Council:
==21== His honor and myself are at the one,
==22== And at the other is my good friend Catesby;
==23== Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
==24== Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
==25== Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;
==26== And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple
==27== To trust the mock’ry of unquiet slumbers.
==28== To fly the boar before the boar pursues
==29== Were to incense the boar to follow us,
==30== And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
==31== Go, bid thy master rise and come to me,
==32== And we will both together to the Tower,
==33== Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly.

**STAN. MESS.**
==34== I’ll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.

*Exit.*

*Enter Catesby.*

**CATE.**
==35== Many good morrows to my noble lord!

**HAST.**
==36== Good morrow, Catesby, you are early stirring.
==37== What news, what news, in this our tott’ring state?

**CATE.**
==38== It is a reeling world indeed, my lord,
==39== And I believe will never stand upright
==40== Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.

**HAST.**
==41== How? Wear the garland? Dost thou mean the crown?

**CATE.**
==42== Ay, my good lord.

**HAST.**
==43== I’ll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
==44== Before I’ll see the crown so foul misplac’d.
==45== But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?

**CATE.**
==46== Ay, on my life, and hopes to find you forward
==47== Upon his party for the gain thereof;
==48== And thereupon he sends you this good news,
==49== That this same very day your enemies,
==50== The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.

**HAST.**
==51== Indeed I am no mourner for that news,
==52== Because they have been still my adversaries;
==53== But that I’ll give my voice on Richard’s side
==54== To bar my master’s heirs in true descent,
==55== God knows I will not do it, to the death!

**CATE.**
==56== God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!

**HAST.**
==57== But I shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence,
==58== That they which brought me in my master’s hate,
==59== I live to look upon their tragedy.
==60== Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,
==61== I’ll send some packing that yet think not on’t.

**CATE.**
==62== ’Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
==63== When men are unprepar’d and look not for it.

**HAST.**
==64== O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out
==65== With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so ’twill do
==66== With some men else, that think themselves as safe
==67== As thou and I, who (as thou know’st) are dear
==68== To princely Richard and to Buckingham.

**CATE.**
==69== The princes both make high account of you⁠—
*(Aside.)*
==70== For they account his head upon the bridge.

**HAST.**
==71== I know they do, and I have well deserv’d it.
*(Enter Lord Stanley.)*
==72== Come on, come on, where is your boar-spear, man?
==73== Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?

**STAN.**
==74== My lord, good morrow, good morrow, Catesby.
==75== You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
==76== I do not like these several Councils, I.

**HAST.**
==77== My lord,
==78== I hold my life as dear as you do yours,
==79== And never in my days, I do protest,
==80== Was it so precious to me as ’tis now.
==81== Think you, but that I know our state secure,
==82== I would be so triumphant as I am?

**STAN.**
==83== The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
==84== Were jocund, and suppos’d their states were sure,
==85== And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
==86== But yet you see how soon the day o’ercast.
==87== This sudden stab of rancor I misdoubt;
==88== Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
==89== What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.

**HAST.**
==90== Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
==91== Today the lords you talk’d of are beheaded.

**STAN.**
==92== They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
==93== Than some that have accus’d them wear their hats.
==94== But come, my lord, let’s away.

*Enter a Pursuivant, also named Hastings.*

**HAST.**
==95== Go on before, I’ll talk with this good fellow.
*(Exeunt Lord Stanley and Catesby.)*
==96== How now, sirrah? How goes the world with thee?

**PURS.**
==97== The better that your lordship please to ask.

**HAST.**
==98== I tell thee, man, ’tis better with me now
==99== Than when thou met’st me last where now we meet.
==100== Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
==101== By the suggestion of the Queen’s allies;
==102== But now I tell thee (keep it to thyself) 
==103== This day those enemies are put to death,
==104== And I in better state than e’er I was.

**PURS.**
==105== God hold it, to your honor’s good content!

**HAST.**
==106== Gramercy, fellow. There, drink that for me.

*Throws him his purse.*

**PURS.**
==107== I thank your honor.

*Exit Pursuivant.*

*Enter Sir John, a Priest.*

**PRIEST.**
==108== Well met, my lord, I am glad to see your honor.

**HAST.**
==109== I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
==110== I am in your debt for your last exercise;
==111== Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.

*He whispers in his ear.*

**PRIEST.**
==112== I’ll wait upon your lordship.

*Enter Buckingham.*

**BUCK.**
==113== What, talking with a priest, Lord Chamberlain?
==114== Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest,
==115== Your honor hath no shriving work in hand.

**HAST.**
==116== Good faith, and when I met this holy man
==117== The men you talk of came into my mind.
==118== What, go you toward the Tower?

**BUCK.**
==119== I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there.
==120== I shall return before your lordship thence.

**HAST.**
==121== Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.

**BUCK.**
*(Aside.)*
==122== And supper too, although thou know’st it not.⁠—
==123== Come, will you go?

**HAST.**
==123==            I’ll wait upon your lordship.

*Exeunt.*
