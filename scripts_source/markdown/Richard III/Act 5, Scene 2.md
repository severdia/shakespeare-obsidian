## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The camp near Tamworth.*

*Enter Richmond, Oxford, Sir James Blunt, Sir Walter Herbert, and others, with Drum and Colors.*

**RICHM.**
==1== Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
==2== Bruis’d underneath the yoke of tyranny,
==3== Thus far into the bowels of the land
==4== Have we march’d on without impediment;
==5== And here receive we from our father Stanley
==6== Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
==7== The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
==8== That spoil’d your summer fields and fruitful vines,
==9== Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
==10== In your embowell’d bosoms—this foul swine
==11== Is now even in the center of this isle,
==12== Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
==13== From Tamworth thither is but one day’s march.
==14== In God’s name cheerly on, courageous friends,
==15== To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
==16== By this one bloody trial of sharp war.

**OXF.**
==17== Every man’s conscience is a thousand men,
==18== To fight against this guilty homicide.

**HERB.**
==19== I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.

**BLUNT.**
==20== He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,
==21== Which in his dearest need will fly from him.

**RICHM.**
==22== All for our vantage. Then in God’s name march!
==23== True hope is swift and flies with swallow’s wings,
==24== Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

*Exeunt omnes.*
