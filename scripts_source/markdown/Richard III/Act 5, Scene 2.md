## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The camp near Tamworth.*

*Enter Richmond, Oxford, Sir James Blunt, Sir Walter Herbert, and others, with Drum and Colors.*

**RICHM.**
Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
Bruis’d underneath the yoke of tyranny,
Thus far into the bowels of the land
Have we march’d on without impediment;
And here receive we from our father Stanley
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
That spoil’d your summer fields and fruitful vines,
Swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
In your embowell’d bosoms—this foul swine
Is now even in the center of this isle,
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
From Tamworth thither is but one day’s march.
In God’s name cheerly on, courageous friends,
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.

**OXF.**
Every man’s conscience is a thousand men,
To fight against this guilty homicide.

**HERB.**
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.

**BLUNT.**
He hath no friends but what are friends for fear,
Which in his dearest need will fly from him.

**RICHM.**
All for our vantage. Then in God’s name march!
True hope is swift and flies with swallow’s wings,
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.

*Exeunt omnes.*
