## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Salisbury. An open place.*

*Enter Buckingham, with Halberds and the Sheriff, led to execution.*

**BUCK.**
==1==Will not King Richard let me speak with him?

**SHER.**
==2==No, my good lord, therefore be patient.

**BUCK.**
==3==Hastings, and Edward’s children, Grey and Rivers,
==4==Holy King Henry and thy fair son Edward,
==5==Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
==6==By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
==7==If that your moody discontented souls
==8==Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
==9==Even for revenge mock my destruction!
==10==This is All-Souls’ day, fellow, is it not?

**SHER.**
==11==It is, my lord.

**BUCK.**
==12==Why then All-Souls’ day is my body’s doomsday.
==13==This is the day which, in King Edward’s time,
==14==I wish’d might fall on me when I was found
==15==False to his children and his wive’s allies;
==16==This is the day wherein I wish’d to fall
==17==By the false faith of him whom most I trusted;
==18==This, this All-Souls’ day to my fearful soul,
==19==Is the determin’d respite of my wrongs.
==20==That high All-Seer, which I dallied with,
==21==Hath turn’d my feigned prayer on my head,
==22==And given in earnest what I begg’d in jest.
==23==Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
==24==To turn their own points in their masters’ bosoms;
==25==Thus Margaret’s curse falls heavy on my neck:
==26==“When he,” quoth she, “shall split thy heart with sorrow,
==27==Remember Margaret was a prophetess.”
==28==Come lead me, officers, to the block of shame;
==29==Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

*Exeunt Buckingham and Sheriff with Officers.*
