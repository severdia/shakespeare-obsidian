## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*London. A street.*

*Enter one Citizen at one door and another at the other.*

**1. CIT.**
==1== Good morrow, neighbor, whither away so fast?

**2. CIT.**
==2== I promise you, I scarcely know myself.
==3== Hear you the news abroad?

**1. CIT.**
==3==               Yes, that the King is dead.

**2. CIT.**
==4== Ill news, by’r lady—seldom comes the better.
==5== I fear, I fear ’twill prove a giddy world.

*Enter another Citizen.*

**3. CIT.**
==6== Neighbors, God speed!

**1. CIT.**
==6==               Give you good morrow, sir.

**3. CIT.**
==7== Doth the news hold of good King Edward’s death?

**2. CIT.**
==8== Ay, sir, it is too true, God help the while!

**3. CIT.**
==9== Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.

**1. CIT.**
==10== No, no, by God’s good grace his son shall reign.

**3. CIT.**
==11== Woe to that land that’s govern’d by a child!

**2. CIT.**
==12== In him there is a hope of government,
==13== Which in his nonage, council under him,
==14== And in his full and ripened years, himself,
==15== No doubt shall then, and till then, govern well.

**1. CIT.**
==16== So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
==17== Was crown’d in Paris but at nine months old.

**3. CIT.**
==18== Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot,
==19== For then this land was famously enrich’d
==20== With politic grave counsel; then the King
==21== Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.

**1. CIT.**
==22== Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother.

**3. CIT.**
==23== Better it were they all came by his father,
==24== Or by his father there were none at all;
==25== For emulation who shall now be nearest
==26== Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
==27== O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester,
==28== And the Queen’s sons and brothers haught and proud!
==29== And were they to be rul’d, and not to rule,
==30== This sickly land might solace as before.

**1. CIT.**
==31== Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be well.

**3. CIT.**
==32== When clouds are seen, wise men put on their cloaks;
==33== When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;
==34== When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
==35== Untimely storms makes men expect a dearth.
==36== All may be well; but if God sort it so,
==37== ’Tis more than we deserve or I expect.

**2. CIT.**
==38== Truly, the hearts of men are full of fear.
==39== You cannot reason (almost) with a man
==40== That looks not heavily and full of dread.

**3. CIT.**
==41== Before the days of change, still is it so.
==42== By a divine instinct men’s minds mistrust
==43== Ensuing danger; as by proof we see
==44== The water swell before a boist’rous storm.
==45== But leave it all to God. Whither away?

**2. CIT.**
==46== Marry, we were sent for to the justices.

**3. CIT.**
==47== And so was I. I’ll bear you company.

*Exeunt.*
