## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Flourish. Enter the King Edward sick, the Queen Elizabeth, Lord Marquess Dorset, Rivers, Hastings, Catesby, Buckingham, Grey, and others.*

**K. EDW.**
==1==Why, so: now have I done a good day’s work.
==2==You peers, continue this united league.
==3==I every day expect an embassage
==4==From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
==5==And more in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
==6==Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.
==7==Hastings and Rivers, take each other’s hand,
==8==Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.

**RIV.**
==9==By heaven, my soul is purg’d from grudging hate,
==10==And with my hand I seal my true heart’s love.

**HAST.**
==11==So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!

**K. EDW.**
==12==Take heed you dally not before your king,
==13==Lest He that is the supreme King of kings
==14==Confound your hidden falsehood and award
==15==Either of you to be the other’s end.

**HAST.**
==16==So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!

**RIV.**
==17==And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

**K. EDW.**
==18==Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;
==19==Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you;
==20==You have been factious one against the other.
==21==Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand,
==22==And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==23==There, Hastings, I will never more remember
==24==Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

**K. EDW.**
==25==Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord Marquess.

**DOR.**
==26==This interchange of love, I here protest,
==27==Upon my part shall be inviolable.

**HAST.**
==28==And so swear I.

*They embrace.*

**K. EDW.**
==29==Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
==30==With thy embracements to my wive’s allies,
==31==And make me happy in your unity.

**BUCK.**
==32==When ever Buckingham doth turn his hate
==33==Upon your Grace
*(To the Queen.)*
==34==But with all duteous love
==35==Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
==36==With hate in those where I expect most love!
==37==When I have most need to employ a friend,
==38==And most assured that he is a friend,
==39==Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile
==40==Be he unto me! This do I beg of God,
==41==When I am cold in love to you or yours.

*They embrace.*

**K. EDW.**
==42==A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
==43==Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
==44==There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here
==45==To make the blessed period of this peace.

**BUCK.**
==46==And in good time,
==47==Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the Duke.

*Enter Ratcliffe and Gloucester.*

**GLOU.**
==48==Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen,
==49==And, princely peers, a happy time of day!

**K. EDW.**
==50==Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.
==51==Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,
==52==Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,
==53==Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

**GLOU.**
==54==A blessed labor, my most sovereign lord.
==55==Among this princely heap, if any here
==56==By false intelligence or wrong surmise
==57==Hold me a foe⁠—
==58==If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
==59==Have aught committed that is hardly borne
==60==By any in this presence, I desire
==61==To reconcile me to his friendly peace.
==62==’Tis death to me to be at enmity;
==63==I hate it, and desire all good men’s love.
==64==First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
==65==Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
==66==Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
==67==If ever any grudge were lodg’d between us;
==68==Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,
==69==That all without desert have frown’d on me;
==70==Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen—indeed of all.
==71==I do not know that Englishman alive
==72==With whom my soul is any jot at odds
==73==More than the infant that is born tonight.
==74==I thank my God for my humility.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==75==A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
==76==I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
==77==My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness
==78==To take our brother Clarence to your grace.

**GLOU.**
==79==Why, madam, have I off’red love for this,
==80==To be so flouted in this royal presence?
==81==Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead?
*(They all start.)*
==82==You do him injury to scorn his corse.

**K. EDW.**
==83==Who knows not he is dead? Who knows he is?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==84==All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!

**BUCK.**
==85==Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

**DOR.**
==86==Ay, my good lord, and no man in the presence
==87==But his red color hath forsook his cheeks.

**K. EDW.**
==88==Is Clarence dead? The order was revers’d.

**GLOU.**
==89==But he, poor man, by your first order died,
==90==And that a winged Mercury did bear;
==91==Some tardy cripple bare the countermand,
==92==That came too lag to see him buried.
==93==God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
==94==Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
==95==Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
==96==And yet go current from suspicion!

*Enter Stanley, Earl of Derby.*

**STAN.**
==97==A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!

*Kneels.*

**K. EDW.**
==98==I prithee peace, my soul is full of sorrow.

**STAN.**
==99==I will not rise, unless your Highness hear me.

**K. EDW.**
==100==Then say at once what is it thou requests.

**STAN.**
==101==The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant’s life,
==102==Who slew today a riotous gentleman
==103==Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.

**K. EDW.**
==104==Have I a tongue to doom my brother’s death,
==105==And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?
==106==My brother kill’d no man, his fault was thought,
==107==And yet his punishment was bitter death.
==108==Who sued to me for him? Who (in my wrath) 
==109==Kneel’d at my feet and bid me be advis’d?
==110==Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?
==111==Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
==112==The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?
==113==Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury,
==114==When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
==115==And said, “Dear brother, live, and be a king”?
==116==Who told me, when we both lay in the field
==117==Frozen (almost) to death, how he did lap me
==118==Even in his own garments, and did give himself
==119==(All thin and naked) to the numb cold night?
==120==All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
==121==Sinfully pluck’d, and not a man of you
==122==Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
==123==But when your carters or your waiting vassals
==124==Have done a drunken slaughter, and defac’d
==125==The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
==126==You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon,
==127==And I (unjustly too) must grant it you.
*(Stanley rises.)*
==128==But for my brother not a man would speak,
==129==Nor I (ungracious) speak unto myself
==130==For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
==131==Have been beholding to him in his life;
==132==Yet none of you would once beg for his life.
==133==O God! I fear thy justice will take hold
==134==On me and you, and mine and yours, for this.
==135==Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!

*Exeunt some with King and Queen.*

**GLOU.**
==136==This is the fruits of rashness! Mark’d you not
==137==How that the guilty kindred of the Queen
==138==Look’d pale when they did hear of Clarence’ death?
==139==O, they did urge it still unto the King!
==140==God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go
==141==To comfort Edward with our company.

**BUCK.**
==142==We wait upon your Grace.

*Exeunt.*
