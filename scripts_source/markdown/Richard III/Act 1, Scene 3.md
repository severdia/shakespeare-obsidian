## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Enter the Queen Mother Elizabeth, Lord Rivers, Marquess of Dorset, and Lord Grey.*

**RIV.**
==1== Have patience, madam, there’s no doubt his Majesty
==2== Will soon recover his accustom’d health.

**GREY.**
==3== In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;
==4== Therefore for God’s sake entertain good comfort,
==5== And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==6== If he were dead, what would betide on me?

**GREY.**
==7== No other harm but loss of such a lord.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==8== The loss of such a lord includes all harms.

**GREY.**
==9== The heavens have blest you with a goodly son
==10== To be your comforter when he is gone.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==11== Ah! He is young; and his minority
==12== Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
==13== A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

**RIV.**
==14== Is it concluded he shall be Protector?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==15== It is determin’d, not concluded yet;
==16== But so it must be, if the King miscarry.

*Enter Buckingham and Lord Stanley, Earl of Derby.*

**GREY.**
==17== Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.

**BUCK.**
==18== Good time of day unto your royal Grace!

**STAN.**
==19== God make your Majesty joyful, as you have been!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==20== The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby,
==21== To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
==22== Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she’s your wife
==23== And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur’d
==24== I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

**STAN.**
==25== I do beseech you, either not believe
==26== The envious slanders of her false accusers;
==27== Or if she be accus’d on true report,
==28== Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds
==29== From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==30== Saw you the King today, my Lord of Derby?

**STAN.**
==31== But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
==32== Are come from visiting his Majesty.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==33== What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

**BUCK.**
==34== Madam, good hope, his Grace speaks cheerfully.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==35== God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

**BUCK.**
==36== Ay, madam, he desires to make atonement
==37== Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
==38== And between them and my Lord Chamberlain,
==39== And sent to warn them to his royal presence.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==40== Would all were well! But that will never be:
==41== I fear our happiness is at the height.

*Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester and Lord Hastings.*

**GLOU.**
==42== They do me wrong, and I will not endure it!
==43== Who is it that complains unto the King
==44== That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
==45== By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly
==46== That fill his ears with such dissentious rumors.
==47== Because I cannot flatter and look fair,
==48== Smile in men’s faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,
==49== Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
==50== I must be held a rancorous enemy.
==51== Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
==52== But thus his simple truth must be abus’d
==53== With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

**GREY.**
==54== To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?

**GLOU.**
==55== To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace:
==56== When have I injur’d thee? When done thee wrong?
==57== Or thee? Or thee? Or any of your faction?
==58== A plague upon you all! His royal Grace
==59== (Whom God preserve better than you would wish!) 
==60== Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while
==61== But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==62== Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter:
==63== The King, on his own royal disposition
==64== (And not provok’d by any suitor else),
==65== Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
==66== That in your outward action shows itself
==67== Against my children, brothers, and myself,
==68== Makes him to send, that he may learn the ground.

**GLOU.**
==69== I cannot tell, the world is grown so bad
==70== That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.
==71== Since every Jack became a gentleman,
==72== There’s many a gentle person made a Jack.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==73== Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloucester;
==74== You envy my advancement and my friends’.
==75== God grant we never may have need of you!

**GLOU.**
==76== Mean time, God grants that I have need of you.
==77== Our brother is imprison’d by your means,
==78== Myself disgrac’d, and the nobility
==79== Held in contempt, while great promotions
==80== Are daily given to ennoble those
==81== That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==82== By Him that rais’d me to this careful height
==83== From that contented hap which I enjoy’d,
==84== I never did incense his Majesty
==85== Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
==86== An earnest advocate to plead for him.
==87== My lord, you do me shameful injury
==88== Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

**GLOU.**
==89== You may deny that you were not the mean
==90== Of my Lord Hastings’ late imprisonment.

**RIV.**
==91== She may, my lord, for⁠—

**GLOU.**
==92== She may, Lord Rivers! Why, who knows not so?
==93== She may do more, sir, than denying that:
==94== She may help you to many fair preferments,
==95== And then deny her aiding hand therein
==96== And lay those honors on your high desert.
==97== What may she not, she may, ay, marry, may she.

**RIV.**
==98== What, marry, may she?

**GLOU.**
==99== What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,
==100== A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too:
==101== Iwis your grandam had a worser match.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==102== My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
==103== Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.
==104== By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty
==105== Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur’d.
==106== I had rather be a country servant maid
==107== Than a great queen with this condition,
==108== To be so baited, scorn’d, and stormed at.
*(Enter old Queen Margaret behind.)*
==109== Small joy have I in being England’s queen.

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==110== And less’ned be that small, God I beseech him!
==111== Thy honor, state, and seat is due to me.

**GLOU.**
==112== What? Threat you me with telling of the King?
==113== Tell him, and spare not. Look what I have said,
==114== I will avouch’t in presence of the King.
==115== I dare adventure to be sent to th’ Tow’r.
==116== ’Tis time to speak, my pains are quite forgot.

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==117== Out, devil! I do remember them too well:
==118== Thou kill’dst my husband Henry in the Tower,
==119== And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

**GLOU.**
==120== Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband king,
==121== I was a pack-horse in his great affairs:
==122== A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
==123== A liberal rewarder of his friends;
==124== To royalize his blood I spent mine own.

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==125== Ay, and much better blood than his or thine.

**GLOU.**
==126== In all which time you and your husband Grey
==127== Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
==128== And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
==129== In Margaret’s battle at Saint Albans slain?
==130== Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
==131== What you have been ere this, and what you are;
==132== Withal, what I have been, and what I am.

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==133== A murd’rous villain, and so still thou art.

**GLOU.**
==134== Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,
==135== Ay, and forswore himself—which Jesu pardon!⁠—

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==136== Which God revenge!

**GLOU.**
==137== To fight on Edward’s party for the crown,
==138== And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.
==139== I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward’s,
==140== Or Edward’s soft and pitiful, like mine:
==141== I am too childish-foolish for this world.

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==142== Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave this world,
==143== Thou cacodemon, there thy kingdom is.

**RIV.**
==144== My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days,
==145== Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
==146== We follow’d then our lord, our sovereign king.
==147== So should we you, if you should be our king.

**GLOU.**
==148== If I should be? I had rather be a pedlar:
==149== Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==150== As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
==151== You should enjoy, were you this country’s king⁠—
==152== As little joy you may suppose in me
==153== That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==154== A little joy enjoys the queen thereof,
==155== For I am she, and altogether joyless.
==156== I can no longer hold me patient.
*(Comes forward.)*
==157== Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
==158== In sharing that which you have pill’d from me!
==159== Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
==160== If not, that I am queen, you bow like subjects,
==161== Yet that, by you depos’d, you quake like rebels?
==162== Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!

**GLOU.**
==163== Foul wrinkled witch, what mak’st thou in my sight?

**Q. MARG.**
==164== But repetition of what thou hast marr’d,
==165== That will I make before I let thee go.

**GLOU.**
==166== Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

**Q. MARG.**
==167== I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
==168== Than death can yield me here by my abode.
==169== A husband and a son thou ow’st to me⁠—
==170== And thou a kingdom—all of you allegiance.
==171== This sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
==172== And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

**GLOU.**
==173== The curse my noble father laid on thee
==174== When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper,
==175== And with thy scorns drew’st rivers from his eyes,
==176== And then, to dry them, gav’st the Duke a clout
==177== Steep’d in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland⁠—
==178== His curses then, from bitterness of soul
==179== Denounc’d against thee, are all fall’n upon thee;
==180== And God, not we, hath plagu’d thy bloody deed.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==181== So just is God, to right the innocent.

**HAST.**
==182== O, ’twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
==183== And the most merciless, that e’er was heard of!

**RIV.**
==184== Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.

**DOR.**
==185== No man but prophesied revenge for it.

**BUCK.**
==186== Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

**Q. MARG.**
==187== What? Were you snarling all before I came,
==188== Ready to catch each other by the throat,
==189== And turn you all your hatred now on me?
==190== Did York’s dread curse prevail so much with heaven
==191== That Henry’s death, my lovely Edward’s death,
==192== Their kingdom’s loss, my woeful banishment,
==193== Should all but answer for that peevish brat?
==194== Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
==195== Why then give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
==196== Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,
==197== As ours by murder, to make him a king!
==198== Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,
==199== For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,
==200== Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
==201== Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
==202== Outlive thy glory like my wretched self!
==203== Long mayst thou live to wail thy children’s death,
==204== And see another, as I see thee now,
==205== Deck’d in thy rights as thou art stall’d in mine!
==206== Long die thy happy days before thy death,
==207== And after many length’ned hours of grief,
==208== Die neither mother, wife, nor England’s queen!
==209== Rivers and Dorset, you were standers-by,
==210== And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
==211== Was stabb’d with bloody daggers: God, I pray him
==212== That none of you may live his natural age,
==213== But by some unlook’d accident cut off!

**GLOU.**
==214== Have done thy charm, thou hateful with’red hag.

**Q. MARG.**
==215== And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
==216== If heaven have any grievous plague in store
==217== Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
==218== O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
==219== And then hurl down their indignation
==220== On thee, the troubler of the poor world’s peace!
==221== The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
==222== Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv’st,
==223== And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
==224== No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
==225== Unless it be while some tormenting dream
==226== Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
==227== Thou elvish-mark’d, abortive, rooting hog!
==228== Thou that wast seal’d in thy nativity
==229== The slave of nature and the son of hell!
==230== Thou slander of thy heavy mother’s womb!
==231== Thou loathed issue of thy father’s loins!
==232== Thou rag of honor! Thou detested⁠—

**GLOU.**
==233== Margaret.

**Q. MARG.**
==233==         Richard!

**GLOU.**
==233==               Ha!

**Q. MARG.**
==233==                   I call thee not.

**GLOU.**
==234== I cry thee mercy then; for I did think
==235== That thou hadst call’d me all these bitter names.

**Q. MARG.**
==236== Why, so I did, but look’d for no reply.
==237== O, let me make the period to my curse!

**GLOU.**
==238== ’Tis done by me, and ends in “Margaret.”

**Q. ELIZ.**
==239== Thus have you breath’d your curse against yourself.

**Q. MARG.**
==240== Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
==241== Why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider
==242== Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
==243== Fool, fool, thou whet’st a knife to kill thyself.
==244== The day will come that thou shalt wish for me
==245== To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back’d toad.

**HAST.**
==246== False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
==247== Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.

**Q. MARG.**
==248== Foul shame upon you, you have all mov’d mine.

**RIV.**
==249== Were you well serv’d, you would be taught your duty.

**Q. MARG.**
==250== To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
==251== Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
==252== O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!

**DOR.**
==253== Dispute not with her, she is lunatic.

**Q. MARG.**
==254== Peace, Master Marquess, you are malapert,
==255== Your fire-new stamp of honor is scarce current.
==256== O that your young nobility could judge
==257== What ’twere to lose it and be miserable!
==258== They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,
==259== And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

**GLOU.**
==260== Good counsel, marry! Learn it, learn it, Marquess.

**DOR.**
==261== It touches you, my lord, as much as me.

**GLOU.**
==262== Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,
==263== Our aery buildeth in the cedar’s top
==264== And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

**Q. MARG.**
==265== And turns the sun to shade—alas, alas!
==266== Witness my son, now in the shade of death,
==267== Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
==268== Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
==269== Your aery buildeth in our aery’s nest:
==270== O God that seest it, do not suffer it!
==271== As it is won with blood, lost be it so!

**BUCK.**
==272== Peace, peace, for shame! If not, for charity.

**Q. MARG.**
==273== Urge neither charity nor shame to me.
*(Turning to the others.)*
==274== Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
==275== And shamefully my hopes, by you, are butcher’d.
==276== My charity is outrage, life my shame,
==277== And in that shame still live my sorrow’s rage!

**BUCK.**
==278== Have done, have done.

**Q. MARG.**
==279== O princely Buckingham, I’ll kiss thy hand
==280== In sign of league and amity with thee.
==281== Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!
==282== Thy garments are not spotted with our blood;
==283== Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

**BUCK.**
==284== Nor no one here; for curses never pass
==285== The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

**Q. MARG.**
==286== I will not think but they ascend the sky,
==287== And there awake God’s gentle-sleeping peace.
==288== O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
==289== Look when he fawns he bites; and when he bites,
==290== His venom tooth will rankle to the death.
==291== Have not to do with him, beware of him;
==292== Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
==293== And all their ministers attend on him.

**GLOU.**
==294== What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

**BUCK.**
==295== Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

**Q. MARG.**
==296== What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
==297== And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
==298== O but remember this another day,
==299== When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
==300== And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
==301== Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
==302== And he to yours, and all of you to God’s!

*Exit.*

**BUCK.**
==303== My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.

**RIV.**
==304== And so doth mine. I muse why she’s at liberty.

**GLOU.**
==305== I cannot blame her; by God’s holy Mother,
==306== She hath had too much wrong, and I repent
==307== My part thereof that I have done to her.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==308== I never did her any to my knowledge.

**GLOU.**
==309== Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
==310== I was too hot to do somebody good
==311== That is too cold in thinking of it now.
==312== Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;
==313== He is frank’d up to fatting for his pains⁠—
==314== God pardon them that are the cause thereof!

**RIV.**
==315== A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion⁠—
==316== To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

**GLOU.**
==317== So do I ever⁠—
*(Speaks to himself.)*
==317==            being well advis’d;
==318== For had I curs’d now, I had curs’d myself.

*Enter Catesby.*

**CATE.**
==319== Madam, his Majesty doth call for you,
==320== And for your Grace, and yours, my gracious lord.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==321== Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go with me?

**RIV.**
==322== We wait upon your Grace.

*Exeunt all but Gloucester.*

**GLOU.**
==323== I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
==324== The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
==325== I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
==326== Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,
==327== I do beweep to many simple gulls⁠—
==328== Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham⁠—
==329== And tell them ’tis the Queen and her allies
==330== That stir the King against the Duke my brother.
==331== Now they believe it, and withal whet me
==332== To be reveng’d on Rivers, Dorset, Grey.
==333== But then I sigh, and, with a piece of scripture,
==334== Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
==335== And thus I clothe my naked villainy
==336== With odd old ends stol’n forth of holy writ,
==337== And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
*(Enter two Murderers.)*
==338== But soft, here come my executioners.
==339== How now, my hardy, stout, resolved mates,
==340== Are you now going to dispatch this thing?

**1. MUR.**
==341== We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant,
==342== That we may be admitted where he is.

**GLOU.**
==343== Well thought upon, I have it here about me.
*(Gives the warrant.)*
==344== When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
==345== But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
==346== Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
==347== For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
==348== May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

**1. MUR.**
==349== Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
==350== Talkers are no good doers. Be assur’d;
==351== We go to use our hands, and not our tongues.

**GLOU.**
==352== Your eyes drop millstones, when fools’ eyes fall tears.
==353== I like you, lads, about your business straight.
==354== Go, go, dispatch.

**1. MUR.**
==355== We will, my noble lord.

*Exeunt.*
