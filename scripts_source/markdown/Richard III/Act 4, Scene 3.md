## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Enter Tyrrel.*

**TYR.**
==1== The tyrannous and bloody act is done,
==2== The most arch deed of piteous massacre
==3== That ever yet this land was guilty of.
==4== Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn
==5== To do this piece of ruthless butchery,
==6== Albeit they were flesh’d villains, bloody dogs,
==7== Melted with tenderness and kind compassion,
==8== Wept like two children in their deaths’ sad story.
==9== “O, thus,” quoth Dighton, “lay the gentle babes.”
==10== “Thus, thus,” quoth Forrest, “girdling one another
==11== Within their alabaster innocent arms.
==12== Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
==13== Which in their summer beauty kiss’d each other.
==14== A book of prayers on their pillow lay,
==15== Which once,” quoth Forrest, “almost chang’d my mind;
==16== But O! The devil”—there the villain stopp’d;
==17== When Dighton thus told on, “We smothered
==18== The most replenished sweet work of Nature
==19== That from the prime creation e’er she framed.”
==20== Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse
==21== They could not speak; and so I left them both,
==22== To bear this tidings to the bloody King.
*(Enter King Richard.)*
==23== And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!

**K. RICH.**
==24== Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

**TYR.**
==25== If to have done the thing you gave in charge
==26== Beget your happiness, be happy then,
==27== For it is done.

**K. RICH.**
==27==         But didst thou see them dead?

**TYR.**
==28== I did, my lord.

**K. RICH.**
==28==         And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

**TYR.**
==29== The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them,
==30== But where (to say the truth) I do not know.

**K. RICH.**
==31== Come to me, Tyrrel, soon, at after-supper,
==32== When thou shalt tell the process of their death.
==33== Mean time, but think how I may do thee good,
==34== And be inheritor of thy desire.
==35== Farewell till then.

**TYR.**
==35==            I humbly take my leave.

*Exit.*

**K. RICH.**
==36== The son of Clarence have I pent up close,
==37== His daughter meanly have I match’d in marriage,
==38== The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham’s bosom,
==39== And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.
==40== Now for I know the Britain Richmond aims
==41== At young Elizabeth, my brother’s daughter,
==42== And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,
==43== To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.

*Enter Ratcliffe.*

**RAT.**
==44== My lord⁠—

**K. RICH.**
==45== Good or bad news, that thou com’st in so bluntly?

**RAT.**
==46== Bad news, my lord. Morton is fled to Richmond,
==47== And Buckingham, back’d with the hardy Welshmen,
==48== Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

**K. RICH.**
==49== Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
==50== Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
==51== Come, I have learn’d that fearful commenting
==52== Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
==53== Delay leads impotent and snail-pac’d beggary.
==54== Then fiery expedition be my wing,
==55== Jove’s Mercury, and herald for a king!
==56== Go muster men. My counsel is my shield;
==57== We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

*Exeunt.*
