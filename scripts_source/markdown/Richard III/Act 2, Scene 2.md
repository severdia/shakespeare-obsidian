## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Enter the old Duchess of York with the two children of Clarence (Edward and Margaret Plantagenet).*

**EDW.**
==1== Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?

**DUCH.**
==2== No, boy.

**MARG.**
==3== Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,
==4== And cry, “O Clarence, my unhappy son!”?

**EDW.**
==5== Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
==6== And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,
==7== If that our noble father were alive?

**DUCH.**
==8== My pretty cousins, you mistake me both:
==9== I do lament the sickness of the King,
==10== As loath to lose him, not your father’s death;
==11== It were lost sorrow to wail one that’s lost.

**EDW.**
==12== Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.
==13== The King mine uncle is to blame for it.
==14== God will revenge it, whom I will importune
==15== With earnest prayers all to that effect.

**MARG.**
==16== And so will I.

**DUCH.**
==17== Peace, children, peace, the King doth love you well.
==18== Incapable and shallow innocents,
==19== You cannot guess who caus’d your father’s death.

**EDW.**
==20== Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
==21== Told me the King, provok’d to it by the Queen,
==22== Devis’d impeachments to imprison him;
==23== And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
==24== And pitied me, and kindly kiss’d my cheek;
==25== Bade me rely on him as on my father,
==26== And he would love me dearly as a child.

**DUCH.**
==27== Ah! That deceit should steal such gentle shape,
==28== And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice!
==29== He is my son—ay, and therein my shame,
==30== Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

**EDW.**
==31== Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?

**DUCH.**
==32== Ay, boy.

**EDW.**
==33== I cannot think it. Hark, what noise is this?

*Enter the Queen Elizabeth with her hair about her ears; Rivers and Dorset after her.*

**Q. ELIZ.**
==34== Ah! Who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
==35== To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
==36== I’ll join with black despair against my soul,
==37== And to myself become an enemy.

**DUCH.**
==38== What means this scene of rude impatience?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==39== To make an act of tragic violence.
==40== Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead!
==41== Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
==42== Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
==43== If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
==44== That our swift-winged souls may catch the King’s,
==45== Or like obedient subjects follow him
==46== To his new kingdom of ne’er-changing night.

**DUCH.**
==47== Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
==48== As I had title in thy noble husband!
==49== I have bewept a worthy husband’s death,
==50== And liv’d with looking on his images;
==51== But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
==52== Are crack’d in pieces by malignant death,
==53== And I for comfort have but one false glass,
==54== That grieves me when I see my shame in him.
==55== Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
==56== And hast the comfort of thy children left;
==57== But death hath snatch’d my husband from mine arms,
==58== And pluck’d two crutches from my feeble hands,
==59== Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I
==60== (Thine being but a moi’ty of my moan) 
==61== To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!

**EDW.**
==62== Ah, aunt! You wept not for our father’s death;
==63== How can we aid you with our kindred tears?

**MARG.**
==64== Our fatherless distress was left unmoan’d,
==65== Your widow-dolor likewise be unwept!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==66== Give me no help in lamentation,
==67== I am not barren to bring forth complaints.
==68== All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
==69== That I being govern’d by the watery moon,
==70== May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
==71== Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!

**CHIL.**
==72== Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!

**DUCH.**
==73== Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==74== What stay had I but Edward? And he’s gone.

**CHIL.**
==75== What stay had we but Clarence? And he’s gone.

**DUCH.**
==76== What stays had I but they? And they are gone.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==77== Was never widow had so dear a loss.

**CHIL.**
==78== Were never orphans had so dear a loss.

**DUCH.**
==79== Was never mother had so dear a loss.
==80== Alas! I am the mother of these griefs:
==81== Their woes are parcell’d, mine is general.
==82== She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
==83== I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she;
==84== These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;
==85== I for an Edward weep, so do not they.
==86== Alas! You three on me, threefold distress’d,
==87== Pour all your tears. I am your sorrow’s nurse,
==88== And I will pamper it with lamentation.

**DOR.**
==89== Comfort, dear mother, God is much displeas’d
==90== That you take with unthankfulness his doing.
==91== In common worldly things ’tis call’d ungrateful
==92== With dull unwillingness to repay a debt,
==93== Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
==94== Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
==95== For it requires the royal debt it lent you.

**RIV.**
==96== Madam, bethink you like a careful mother
==97== Of the young Prince your son. Send straight for him,
==98== Let him be crown’d, in him your comfort lives.
==99== Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward’s grave,
==100== And plant your joys in living Edward’s throne.

*Enter Richard of Gloucester, Buckingham, Stanley Earl of Derby, Hastings, and Ratcliffe.*

**GLOU.**
==101== Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause
==102== To wail the dimming of our shining star;
==103== But none can help our harms by wailing them.
==104== Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy,
==105== I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee
==106== I crave your blessing.

**DUCH.**
==107== God bless thee, and put meekness in thy breast,
==108== Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!

**GLOU.**
==109== Amen!⁠—
*(Aside.)*
==109==     And make me die a good old man!
==110== That is the butt-end of a mother’s blessing.
==111== I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.

**BUCK.**
==112== You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers
==113== That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,
==114== Now cheer each other in each other’s love.
==115== Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
==116== We are to reap the harvest of his son.
==117== The broken rancor of your high-swoll’n hates,
==118== But lately splinter’d, knit, and join’d together,
==119== Must gently be preserv’d, cherish’d, and kept.
==120== Me seemeth good that, with some little train,
==121== Forthwith from Ludlow the young Prince be fet
==122== Hither to London, to be crown’d our king.

**RIV.**
==123== Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?

**BUCK.**
==124== Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude
==125== The new-heal’d wound of malice should break out,
==126== Which would be so much the more dangerous,
==127== By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern’d.
==128== Where every horse bears his commanding rein
==129== And may direct his course as please himself,
==130== As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
==131== In my opinion, ought to be prevented.

**GLOU.**
==132== I hope the King made peace with all of us,
==133== And the compact is firm and true in me.

**RIV.**
==134== And so in me, and so (I think) in all.
==135== Yet since it is but green, it should be put
==136== To no apparent likelihood of breach,
==137== Which haply by much company might be urg’d;
==138== Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
==139== That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.

**HAST.**
==140== And so say I.

**GLOU.**
==141== Then be it so, and go we to determine
==142== Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
==143== Madam, and you, my sister, will you go
==144== To give your censures in this business?

**Q. ELIZ. AND DUCH.**
==145== With all our hearts.

*Exeunt. Manent Buckingham and Richard.*

**BUCK.**
==146== My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
==147== For God sake let not us two stay at home;
==148== For by the way, I’ll sort occasion,
==149== As index to the story we late talk’d of,
==150== To part the Queen’s proud kindred from the Prince.

**GLOU.**
==151== My other self, my counsel’s consistory,
==152== My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,
==153== I, as a child, will go by thy direction.
==154== Toward Ludlow then, for we’ll not stay behind.

*Exeunt.*
