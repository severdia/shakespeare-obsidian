## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Sound a sennet. Enter Richard in pomp, crowned; Buckingham, Catesby, Ratcliffe, Lovel, a Page, and others.*

**K. RICH.**
==1== Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham⁠—

**BUCK.**
==2== My gracious sovereign?

**K. RICH.**
==3== Give me thy hand.
*(Here he ascendeth the throne. Sound.)*
==3==            Thus high, by thy advice
==4== And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
==5== But shall we wear these glories for a day?
==6== Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?

**BUCK.**
==7== Still live they, and forever let them last!

**K. RICH.**
==8== Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
==9== To try if thou be current gold indeed.
==10== Young Edward lives: think now what I would speak.

**BUCK.**
==11== Say on, my loving lord.

**K. RICH.**
==12== Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king.

**BUCK.**
==13== Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.

**K. RICH.**
==14== Ha? Am I king? ’Tis so—but Edward lives.

**BUCK.**
==15== True, noble prince.

**K. RICH.**
==15==            O bitter consequence,
==16== That Edward still should live true noble prince!
==17== Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.
==18== Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead,
==19== And I would have it suddenly perform’d.
==20== What say’st thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief.

**BUCK.**
==21== Your Grace may do your pleasure.

**K. RICH.**
==22== Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezes.
==23== Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

**BUCK.**
==24== Give me some little breath, some pause, dear lord,
==25== Before I positively speak in this.
==26== I will resolve you herein presently.

*Exit Buckingham.*

**CATE.**
*(Aside to a stander-by.)*
==27== The King is angry, see, he gnaws his lip.

**K. RICH.**
==28== I will converse with iron-witted fools
==29== And unrespective boys; none are for me
==30== That look into me with considerate eyes.
==31== High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
==32== Boy!

**PAGE.**
==33== My lord?

**K. RICH.**
==34== Know’st thou not any whom corrupting gold
==35== Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?

**PAGE.**
==36== I know a discontented gentleman
==37== Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.
==38== Gold were as good as twenty orators,
==39== And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.

**K. RICH.**
==40== What is his name?

**PAGE.**
==40==            His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

**K. RICH.**
==41== I partly know the man; go call him hither, boy.
*(Exit Page.)*
==42== The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
==43== No more shall be the neighbor to my counsels.
==44== Hath he so long held out with me untir’d,
==45== And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so.
*(Enter Stanley.)*
==46== How now, Lord Stanley, what’s the news?

**STAN.**
==47== Know, my loving lord,
==48== The Marquess Dorset, as I hear, is fled
==49== To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.

*Stands apart.*

**K. RICH.**
==50== Come hither, Catesby. Rumor it abroad
==51== That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;
==52== I will take order for her keeping close.
==53== Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,
==54== Whom I will marry straight to Clarence’ daughter;
==55== The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
==56== Look how thou dream’st! I say again, give out
==57== That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.
==58== About it, for it stands me much upon
==59== To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
*(Exit Catesby.)*
==60== I must be married to my brother’s daughter,
==61== Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
==62== Murder her brothers and then marry her⁠—
==63== Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
==64== So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
==65== Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
*(Enter Page with Sir James Tyrrel.)*
==66== Is thy name Tyrrel?

**TYR.**
==67== James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

**K. RICH.**
==68== Art thou indeed?

**TYR.**
==68==         Prove me, my gracious lord.

**K. RICH.**
==69== Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

**TYR.**
==70== Please you;
==71== But I had rather kill two enemies.

**K. RICH.**
==72== Why, there thou hast it; two deep enemies,
==73== Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep’s disturbers,
==74== Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
==75== Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

**TYR.**
==76== Let me have open means to come to them,
==77== And soon I’ll rid you from the fear of them.

**K. RICH.**
==78== Thou sing’st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.
==79== Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.
*(Whispers.)*
==80== There is no more but so; say it is done,
==81== And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.

**TYR.**
==82== I will dispatch it straight.

*Exit.*

*Enter Buckingham.*

**BUCK.**
==83== My lord, I have consider’d in my mind
==84== The late request that you did sound me in.

**K. RICH.**
==85== Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond.

**BUCK.**
==86== I hear the news, my lord.

**K. RICH.**
==87== Stanley, he is your wive’s son: well, look unto it.

**BUCK.**
==88== My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,
==89== For which your honor and your faith is pawn’d,
==90== Th’ earldom of Herford, and the moveables,
==91== Which you have promised I shall possess.

**K. RICH.**
==92== Stanley, look to your wife. If she convey
==93== Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

**BUCK.**
==94== What says your Highness to my just request?

**K. RICH.**
==95== I do remember me, Henry the Sixth
==96== Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
==97== When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
==98== A king—perhaps—perhaps⁠—

**BUCK.**
==99== My lord⁠—

**K. RICH.**
==100== How chance the prophet could not at that time
==101== Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?

**BUCK.**
==102== My lord, your promise for the earldom⁠—

**K. RICH.**
==103== Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
==104== The mayor in courtesy show’d me the castle,
==105== And call’d it Rouge-mount, at which name I started,
==106== Because a bard of Ireland told me once
==107== I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

**BUCK.**
==108== My lord⁠—

**K. RICH.**
==109== Ay, what’s a’ clock?

**BUCK.**
==110== I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind
==111== Of what you promis’d me.

**K. RICH.**
==111==               Well, but what’s a’ clock?

**BUCK.**
==112== Upon the stroke of ten.

**K. RICH.**
==112==               Well, let it strike.

**BUCK.**
==113== Why let it strike?

**K. RICH.**
==114== Because that like a Jack thou keep’st the stroke
==115== Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
==116== I am not in the giving vein today.

**BUCK.**
==117== May it please you to resolve me in my suit.

**K. RICH.**
==118== Thou troubles! Me, I am not in the vein.

*Exit with all but Buckingham.*

**BUCK.**
==119== And is it thus? Repays he my deep service
==120== With such contempt? Made I him king for this?
==121== O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
==122== To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!

*Exit.*
