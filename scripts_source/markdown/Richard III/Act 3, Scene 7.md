## Act 3, Scene 7
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Baynard’s castle.*

*Enter Richard of Gloucester and Buckingham at several doors.*

**GLOU.**
==1==How now, how now, what say the citizens?

**BUCK.**
==2==Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord,
==3==The citizens are mum, say not a word.

**GLOU.**
==4==Touch’d you the bastardy of Edward’s children?

**BUCK.**
==5==I did, with his contract with Lady Lucy,
==6==And his contract by deputy in France,
==7==Th’ unsatiate greediness of his desire,
==8==And his enforcement of the city wives,
==9==His tyranny for trifles, his own bastardy,
==10==As being got, your father then in France,
==11==And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.
==12==Withal I did infer your lineaments,
==13==Being the right idea of your father,
==14==Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
==15==Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
==16==Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,
==17==Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
==18==Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
==19==Untouch’d or slightly handled in discourse.
==20==And when mine oratory drew to an end,
==21==I bid them that did love their country’s good
==22==Cry, “God save Richard, England’s royal king!”

**GLOU.**
==23==And did they so?

**BUCK.**
==24==No, so God help me, they spake not a word,
==25==But like dumb statues, or breathing stones,
==26==Star’d each on other, and look’d deadly pale;
==27==Which when I saw, I reprehended them,
==28==And ask’d the Mayor what meant this willful silence.
==29==His answer was, the people were not used
==30==To be spoke to but by the Recorder.
==31==Then he was urg’d to tell my tale again:
==32==“Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr’d”⁠—
==33==But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
==34==When he had done, some followers of mine own,
==35==At lower end of the hall, hurl’d up their caps,
==36==And some ten voices cried, “God save King Richard!”
==37==And thus I took the vantage of those few:
==38==“Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,” quoth I,
==39==“This general applause and cheerful shout
==40==Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard”⁠—
==41==And even here brake off, and came away.

**GLOU.**
==42==What tongueless blocks were they! Would they not speak?

**BUCK.**
==43==No, by my troth, my lord.

**GLOU.**
==44==Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?

**BUCK.**
==45==The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear,
==46==Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit;
==47==And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
==48==And stand between two churchmen, good my lord⁠—
==49==For on that ground I’ll make a holy descant⁠—
==50==And be not easily won to our requests:
==51==Play the maid’s part, still answer nay, and take it.

**GLOU.**
==52==I go; and if you plead as well for them
==53==As I can say nay to thee for myself,
==54==No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.

**BUCK.**
==55==Go, go up to the leads, the Lord Mayor knocks.
*(Exit Gloucester.)*
*(Enter the Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens.)*
==56==Welcome, my lord! I dance attendance here;
==57==I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.
*(Enter Catesby.)*
==58==Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?

**CATE.**
==59==He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,
==60==To visit him tomorrow or next day.
==61==He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
==62==Divinely bent to meditation,
==63==And in no worldly suits would he be mov’d,
==64==To draw him from his holy exercise.

**BUCK.**
==65==Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke,
==66==Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen,
==67==In deep designs, in matter of great moment,
==68==No less importing than our general good,
==69==Are come to have some conference with his Grace.

**CATE.**
==70==I’ll signify so much unto him straight.

*Exit.*

**BUCK.**
==71==Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
==72==He is not lulling on a lewd love-bed,
==73==But on his knees at meditation;
==74==Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
==75==But meditating with two deep divines;
==76==Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
==77==But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.
==78==Happy were England, would this virtuous prince
==79==Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof,
==80==But sure I fear we shall not win him to it.

**MAY.**
==81==Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!

**BUCK.**
==82==I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.
*(Enter Catesby.)*
==83==Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?

**CATE.**
==84==My lord,
==85==He wonders to what end you have assembled
==86==Such troops of citizens to come to him,
==87==His Grace not being warn’d thereof before:
==88==He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.

**BUCK.**
==89==Sorry I am my noble cousin should
==90==Suspect me that I mean no good to him.
==91==By heaven, we come to him in perfit love,
==92==And so once more return and tell his Grace.
*(Exit Catesby.)*
==93==When holy and devout religious men
==94==Are at their beads, ’tis much to draw them thence,
==95==So sweet is zealous contemplation.

*Enter Richard of Gloucester aloft, between two Bishops. Catesby returns.*

**MAY.**
==96==See where his Grace stands, ’tween two clergymen!

**BUCK.**
==97==Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
==98==To stay him from the fall of vanity;
==99==And see, a book of prayer in his hand⁠—
==100==True ornaments to know a holy man.
==101==Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
==102==Lend favorable ear to our requests,
==103==And pardon us the interruption
==104==Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.

**GLOU.**
==105==My lord, there needs no such apology.
==106==I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,
==107==Who, earnest in the service of my God,
==108==Deferr’d the visitation of my friends.
==109==But leaving this, what is your Grace’s pleasure?

**BUCK.**
==110==Even that (I hope) which pleaseth God above
==111==And all good men of this ungovern’d isle.

**GLOU.**
==112==I do suspect I have done some offense
==113==That seems disgracious in the city’s eye,
==114==And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.

**BUCK.**
==115==You have, my lord. Would it might please your Grace,
==116==On our entreaties, to amend your fault!

**GLOU.**
==117==Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?

**BUCK.**
==118==Know then, it is your fault that you resign
==119==The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
==120==The scepterd office of your ancestors,
==121==Your state of fortune, and your due of birth,
==122==The lineal glory of your royal house,
==123==To the corruption of a blemish’d stock;
==124==Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
==125==Which here we waken to our country’s good,
==126==The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
==127==Her face defac’d with scars of infamy,
==128==Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
==129==And almost should’red in the swallowing gulf
==130==Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.
==131==Which to recure, we heartily solicit
==132==Your gracious self to take on you the charge
==133==And kingly government of this your land:
==134==Not as protector, steward, substitute,
==135==Or lowly factor for another’s gain;
==136==But as successively, from blood to blood,
==137==Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
==138==For this, consorted with the citizens,
==139==Your very worshipful and loving friends,
==140==And by their vehement instigation,
==141==In this just cause come I to move your Grace.

**GLOU.**
==142==I cannot tell if to depart in silence,
==143==Or bitterly to speak in your reproof,
==144==Best fitteth my degree or your condition.
==145==If not to answer, you might haply think
==146==Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
==147==To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
==148==Which fondly you would here impose on me.
==149==If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
==150==So season’d with your faithful love to me,
==151==Then on the other side, I check’d my friends.
==152==Therefore—to speak, and to avoid the first,
==153==And then, in speaking, not to incur the last⁠—
==154==Definitively thus I answer you:
==155==Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert
==156==Unmeritable shuns your high request.
==157==First, if all obstacles were cut away,
==158==And that my path were even to the crown,
==159==As the ripe revenue and due of birth,
==160==Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
==161==So mighty and so many my defects,
==162==That I would rather hide me from my greatness⁠—
==163==Being a bark to brook no mighty sea⁠—
==164==Than in my greatness covet to be hid
==165==And in the vapor of my glory smother’d.
==166==But God be thank’d, there is no need of me,
==167==And much I need to help you, were there need:
==168==The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
==169==Which mellow’d by the stealing hours of time,
==170==Will well become the seat of majesty,
==171==And make (no doubt) us happy by his reign.
==172==On him I lay that you would lay on me,
==173==The right and fortune of his happy stars,
==174==Which God defend that I should wring from him!

**BUCK.**
==175==My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,
==176==But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
==177==All circumstances well considered.
==178==You say that Edward is your brother’s son:
==179==So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife;
==180==For first was he contract to Lady Lucy⁠—
==181==Your mother lives a witness to his vow⁠—
==182==And afterward by substitute betroth’d
==183==To Bona, sister to the King of France.
==184==These both put off, a poor petitioner,
==185==A care-craz’d mother to a many sons,
==186==A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
==187==Even in the afternoon of her best days,
==188==Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,
==189==Seduc’d the pitch and height of his degree
==190==To base declension and loath’d bigamy.
==191==By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
==192==This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.
==193==More bitterly could I expostulate,
==194==Save that for reverence to some alive,
==195==I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
==196==Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
==197==This proffer’d benefit of dignity;
==198==If not to bless us and the land withal,
==199==Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
==200==From the corruption of abusing times
==201==Unto a lineal true-derived course.

**MAY.**
==202==Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.

**BUCK.**
==203==Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer’d love.

**CATE.**
==204==O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!

**GLOU.**
==205==Alas, why would you heap this care on me?
==206==I am unfit for state and majesty.
==207==I do beseech you take it not amiss,
==208==I cannot nor I will not yield to you.

**BUCK.**
==209==If you refuse it—as, in love and zeal,
==210==Loath to depose the child, your brother’s son;
==211==As well we know your tenderness of heart
==212==And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
==213==Which we have noted in you to your kindred
==214==And egally indeed to all estates⁠—
==215==Yet know, whe’er you accept our suit or no,
==216==Your brother’s son shall never reign our king,
==217==But we will plant some other in the throne,
==218==To the disgrace and downfall of your house;
==219==And in this resolution here we leave you.
==220==Come, citizens. ’Zounds, I’ll entreat no more.

**GLOU.**
==221==O, do not swear, my Lord of Buckingham.

*Exeunt Buckingham, Mayor, Aldermen, and Citizens.*

**CATE.**
==222==Call him again, sweet prince, accept their suit.
==223==If you deny them, all the land will rue it.

**GLOU.**
==224==Will you enforce me to a world of cares?
==225==Call them again, I am not made of stones,
==226==But penetrable to your kind entreaties,
==227==Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
*(Enter Buckingham and the rest.)*
==228==Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,
==229==Since you will buckle Fortune on my back,
==230==To bear her burden whe’er I will or no,
==231==I must have patience to endure the load;
==232==But if black scandal or foul-fac’d reproach
==233==Attend the sequel of your imposition,
==234==Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
==235==From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
==236==For God doth know, and you may partly see,
==237==How far I am from the desire of this.

**MAY.**
==238==God bless your Grace! We see it and will say it.

**GLOU.**
==239==In saying so you shall but say the truth.

**BUCK.**
==240==Then I salute you with this royal title⁠—
==241==Long live Richard, England’s worthy king!

**ALL. IN BAY.**
==242==Amen.

**BUCK.**
==243==Tomorrow may it please you to be crown’d?

**GLOU.**
==244==Even when you please, for you will have it so.

**BUCK.**
==245==Tomorrow then we will attend your Grace,
==246==And so most joyfully we take our leave.

**GLOU.**
*(To the Bishops.)*
==247==Come, let us to our holy work again.⁠—
==248==Farewell, my cousin, farewell, gentle friends.

*Exeunt.*
