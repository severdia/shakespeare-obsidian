## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*Another part of Bosworth Field.*

*Alarum. Excursions. Enter Norfolk and forces fighting; to him Catesby.*

**CATE.**
==1==Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
==2==The King enacts more wonders than a man,
==3==Daring an opposite to every danger.
==4==His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
==5==Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
==6==Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!

*Alarums. Enter King Richard.*

**K. RICH.**
==7==A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!

**CATE.**
==8==Withdraw, my lord, I’ll help you to a horse.

**K. RICH.**
==9==Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
==10==And I will stand the hazard of the die.
==11==I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
==12==Five have I slain today in stead of him.
==13==A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse!

*Exeunt.*
