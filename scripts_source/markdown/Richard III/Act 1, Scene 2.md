## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*London. Another street.*

*Enter the corpse of Henry the Sixth, with Halberds to guard it, Lady Anne being the mourner, attended by Tressel and Berkeley.*

**ANNE.**
==1==Set down, set down your honorable load,
==2==If honor may be shrouded in a hearse,
==3==Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
==4==Th’ untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
==5==Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,
==6==Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster,
==7==Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood,
==8==Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost
==9==To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,
==10==Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaught’red son,
==11==Stabb’d by the self-same hand that made these wounds!
==12==Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life
==13==I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
==14==O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!
==15==Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it!
==16==Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
==17==More direful hap betide that hated wretch
==18==That makes us wretched by the death of thee
==19==Than I can wish to wolves—to spiders, toads,
==20==Or any creeping venom’d thing that lives!
==21==If ever he have child, abortive be it,
==22==Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
==23==Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
==24==May fright the hopeful mother at the view,
==25==And that be heir to his unhappiness!
==26==If ever he have wife, let her be made
==27==More miserable by the life of him
==28==Than I am made by my young lord and thee!
==29==Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
==30==Taken from Paul’s to be interred there;
==31==And still as you are weary of this weight,
==32==Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry’s corse.

*Enter Richard Duke of Gloucester.*

**GLOU.**
==33==Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.

**ANNE.**
==34==What black magician conjures up this fiend
==35==To stop devoted charitable deeds?

**GLOU.**
==36==Villains, set down the corse, or, by Saint Paul,
==37==I’ll make a corse of him that disobeys.

**GENT.**
==38==My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.

**GLOU.**
==39==Unmanner’d dog, stand thou when I command.
==40==Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
==41==Or by Saint Paul I’ll strike thee to my foot,
==42==And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.

**ANNE.**
==43==What do you tremble? Are you all afraid?
==44==Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,
==45==And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.⁠—
==46==Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
==47==Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
==48==His soul thou canst not have. Therefore be gone.

**GLOU.**
==49==Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

**ANNE.**
==50==Foul devil, for God’s sake hence, and trouble us not,
==51==For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
==52==Fill’d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
==53==If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
==54==Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
==55==O gentlemen, see, see dead Henry’s wounds
==56==Open their congeal’d mouths and bleed afresh!
==57==Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
==58==For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood
==59==From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells.
==60==Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural
==61==Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
==62==O God! Which this blood mad’st, revenge his death!
==63==O earth! Which this blood drink’st, revenge his death!
==64==Either heav’n with lightning strike the murd’rer dead;
==65==Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick,
==66==As thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood,
==67==Which his hell-govern’d arm hath butchered!

**GLOU.**
==68==Lady, you know no rules of charity,
==69==Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.

**ANNE.**
==70==Villain, thou know’st nor law of God nor man:
==71==No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.

**GLOU.**
==72==But I know none, and therefore am no beast.

**ANNE.**
==73==O wonderful, when devils tell the troth!

**GLOU.**
==74==More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
==75==Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
==76==Of these supposed crimes, to give me leave
==77==By circumstance but to acquit myself.

**ANNE.**
==78==Vouchsafe, defus’d infection of a man,
==79==Of these known evils, but to give me leave
==80==By circumstance t’ accuse thy cursed self.

**GLOU.**
==81==Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
==82==Some patient leisure to excuse myself.

**ANNE.**
==83==Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
==84==No excuse current but to hang thyself.

**GLOU.**
==85==By such despair I should accuse myself.

**ANNE.**
==86==And by despairing shalt thou stand excused
==87==For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
==88==That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.

**GLOU.**
==89==Say that I slew them not?

**ANNE.**
==90==Then say they were not slain.
==91==But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.

**GLOU.**
==92==I did not kill your husband.

**ANNE.**
==92==              Why then he is alive.

**GLOU.**
==93==Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward’s hands.

**ANNE.**
==94==In thy foul throat thou li’st! Queen Margaret saw
==95==Thy murd’rous falchion smoking in his blood;
==96==The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
==97==But that thy brothers beat aside the point.

**GLOU.**
==98==I was provoked by her sland’rous tongue,
==99==That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.

**ANNE.**
==100==Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,
==101==That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.
==102==Didst thou not kill this king?

**GLOU.**
==102==                  I grant ye.

**ANNE.**
==103==Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then God grant me too
==104==Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
==105==O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!

**GLOU.**
==106==The better for the King of Heaven that hath him.

**ANNE.**
==107==He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.

**GLOU.**
==108==Let him thank me that help to send him thither;
==109==For he was fitter for that place than earth.

**ANNE.**
==110==And thou unfit for any place, but hell.

**GLOU.**
==111==Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

**ANNE.**
==112==Some dungeon.

**GLOU.**
==112==              Your bedchamber.

**ANNE.**
==113==Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

**GLOU.**
==114==So will it, madam, till I lie with you.

**ANNE.**
==115==I hope so.

**GLOU.**
==116==I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
==117==To leave this keen encounter of our wits
==118==And fall something into a slower method:
==119==Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
==120==Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
==121==As blameful as the executioner?

**ANNE.**
==122==Thou wast the cause, and most accurs’d effect.

**GLOU.**
==123==Your beauty was the cause of that effect⁠—
==124==Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep
==125==To undertake the death of all the world,
==126==So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

**ANNE.**
==127==If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
==128==These nails should rent that beauty from my cheeks.

**GLOU.**
==129==These eyes could not endure that beauty’s wrack;
==130==You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
==131==As all the world is cheered by the sun,
==132==So I by that; it is my day, my life.

**ANNE.**
==133==Black night o’ershade thy day, and death thy life!

**GLOU.**
==134==Curse not thyself, fair creature—thou art both.

**ANNE.**
==135==I would I were, to be reveng’d on thee.

**GLOU.**
==136==It is a quarrel most unnatural,
==137==To be reveng’d on him that loveth thee.

**ANNE.**
==138==It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
==139==To be reveng’d on him that kill’d my husband.

**GLOU.**
==140==He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
==141==Did it to help thee to a better husband.

**ANNE.**
==142==His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

**GLOU.**
==143==He lives, that loves thee better than he could.

**ANNE.**
==144==Name him.

**GLOU.**
==144==        Plantagenet.

**ANNE.**
==144==                Why, that was he.

**GLOU.**
==145==The self-same name, but one of better nature.

**ANNE.**
==146==Where is he?

**GLOU.**
==146==        Here.
*(She spits at him.)*
==146==              Why dost thou spit at me?

**ANNE.**
==147==Would it were mortal poison for thy sake!

**GLOU.**
==148==Never came poison from so sweet a place.

**ANNE.**
==149==Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
==150==Out of my sight, thou dost infect mine eyes!

**GLOU.**
==151==Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

**ANNE.**
==152==Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!

**GLOU.**
==153==I would they were, that I might die at once;
==154==For now they kill me with a living death.
==155==Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
==156==Sham’d their aspects with store of childish drops:
==157==These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear⁠—
==158==No, when my father York and Edward wept
==159==To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
==160==When black-fac’d Clifford shook his sword at him;
==161==Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
==162==Told the sad story of my father’s death,
==163==And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
==164==That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
==165==Like trees bedash’d with rain—in that sad time
==166==My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
==167==And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
==168==Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
==169==I never sued to friend nor enemy;
==170==My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
==171==But now thy beauty is propos’d my fee,
==172==My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
*(She looks scornfully at him.)*
==173==Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made
==174==For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
==175==If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
==176==Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword,
==177==Which if thou please to hide in this true breast,
==178==And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
==179==I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
==180==And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
*(He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword.)*
==181==Nay, do not pause: for I did kill King Henry⁠—
==182==But ’twas thy beauty that provoked me.
==183==Nay, now dispatch: ’twas I that stabb’d young Edward
==184==But ’twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
*(She falls the sword.)*
==185==Take up the sword again, or take up me.

**ANNE.**
==186==Arise, dissembler! Though I wish thy death,
==187==I will not be thy executioner.

**GLOU.**
==188==Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

**ANNE.**
==189==I have already.

**GLOU.**
==189==           That was in thy rage.
==190==Speak it again, and even with the word
==191==This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,
==192==Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;
==193==To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.

**ANNE.**
==194==I would I knew thy heart.

**GLOU.**
==195==’Tis figur’d in my tongue.

**ANNE.**
==196==I fear me both are false.

**GLOU.**
==197==Then never was man true.

**ANNE.**
==198==Well, well, put up your sword.

**GLOU.**
==199==Say then my peace is made.

**ANNE.**
==200==That shalt thou know hereafter.

**GLOU.**
==201==But shall I live in hope?

**ANNE.**
==202==All men, I hope, live so.

**GLOU.**
==203==Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

**ANNE.**
==204==To take is not to give.

*Gloucester slips the ring on her finger.*

**GLOU.**
==205==Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,
==206==Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart:
==207==Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
==208==And if thy poor devoted servant may
==209==But beg one favor at thy gracious hand,
==210==Thou dost confirm his happiness forever.

**ANNE.**
==211==What is it?

**GLOU.**
==212==That it may please you leave these sad designs
==213==To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,
==214==And presently repair to Crosby House;
==215==Where (after I have solemnly interr’d
==216==At Chertsey monast’ry this noble king,
==217==And wet his grave with my repentant tears) 
==218==I will with all expedient duty see you.
==219==For diverse unknown reasons, I beseech you,
==220==Grant me this boon.

**ANNE.**
==221==With all my heart, and much it joys me too,
==222==To see you are become so penitent.
==223==Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.

**GLOU.**
==224==Bid me farewell.

**ANNE.**
==224==           ’Tis more than you deserve;
==225==But since you teach me how to flatter you,
==226==Imagine I have said farewell already.

*Exeunt two, Tressel and Berkeley, with Anne.*

**GLOU.**
==227==Sirs, take up the corse.

**GENT.**
==227==           Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

**GLOU.**
==228==No; to White-Friars, there attend my coming.
*(Exit corpse with Halberdiers.)*
==229==Was ever woman in this humor woo’d?
==230==Was ever woman in this humor won?
==231==I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long.
==232==What? I, that kill’d her husband and his father,
==233==To take her in her heart’s extremest hate,
==234==With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
==235==The bleeding witness of my hatred by,
==236==Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,
==237==And I no friends to back my suit at all
==238==But the plain devil and dissembling looks?
==239==And yet to win her! All the world to nothing!
==240==Hah!
==241==Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
==242==Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
==243==Stabb’d in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
==244==A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
==245==Fram’d in the prodigality of nature⁠—
==246==Young, valiant, wise, and (no doubt) right royal⁠—
==247==The spacious world cannot again afford.
==248==And will she yet abase her eyes on me,
==249==That cropp’d the golden prime of this sweet prince
==250==And made her widow to a woeful bed?
==251==On me, whose all not equals Edward’s moi’ty?
==252==On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
==253==My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
==254==I do mistake my person all this while!
==255==Upon my life, she finds (although I cannot) 
==256==Myself to be a marv’lous proper man.
==257==I’ll be at charges for a looking-glass,
==258==And entertain a score or two of tailors
==259==To study fashions to adorn my body:
==260==Since I am crept in favor with myself,
==261==I will maintain it with some little cost.
==262==But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave,
==263==And then return lamenting to my love.
==264==Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
==265==That I may see my shadow as I pass.

*Exit.*
