## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]]

*Another part of Bosworth Field.*

*Alarum. Enter King Richard and Richmond; they fight; Richard is slain.*

*Then, retreat being sounded, flourish, and enter Richmond, Stanley the Earl of Derby, bearing the crown, with other Lords, etc.*

**RICHM.**
==1==God and your arms be prais’d, victorious friends,
==2==The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.

**STAN.**
==3==Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
==4==Lo here this long-usurped royalty
==5==From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
==6==Have I pluck’d off to grace thy brows withal.
==7==Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.

**RICHM.**
==8==Great God of heaven, say amen to all!
==9==But tell me, is young George Stanley living?

**STAN.**
==10==He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,
==11==Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.

**RICHM.**
==12==What men of name are slain on either side?

**STAN.**
==13==John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,
==14==Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.

**RICHM.**
==15==Inter their bodies as become their births.
==16==Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
==17==That in submission will return to us,
==18==And then as we have ta’en the sacrament,
==19==We will unite the White Rose and the Red.
==20==Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
==21==That long have frown’d upon their enmity!
==22==What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
==23==England hath long been mad and scarr’d herself:
==24==The brother blindly shed the brother’s blood,
==25==The father rashly slaughter’d his own son,
==26==The son, compell’d, been butcher to the sire.
==27==All this divided York and Lancaster,
==28==Divided in their dire division,
==29==O now let Richmond and Elizabeth,
==30==The true succeeders of each royal house,
==31==By God’s fair ordinance conjoin together!
==32==And let their heirs (God, if thy will be so) 
==33==Enrich the time to come with smooth-fac’d peace,
==34==With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!
==35==Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
==36==That would reduce these bloody days again,
==37==And make poor England weep in streams of blood!
==38==Let them not live to taste this land’s increase
==39==That would with treason wound this fair land’s peace!
==40==Now civil wounds are stopp’d, peace lives again;
==41==That she may long live here, God say amen!

*Exeunt.*
