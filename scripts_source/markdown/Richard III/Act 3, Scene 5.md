## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 6|Act 3, Scene 6 →]]

*The Tower-walls.*

*Enter Richard of Gloucester and Buckingham in rotten armor, marvelous ill-favored.*

**GLOU.**
==1==Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy color,
==2==Murder thy breath in middle of a word,
==3==And then again begin, and stop again,
==4==As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?

**BUCK.**
==5==Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian,
==6==Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
==7==Tremble and start at wagging of a straw;
==8==Intending deep suspicion, ghastly looks
==9==Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
==10==And both are ready in their offices
==11==At any time to grace my stratagems.
==12==But what, is Catesby gone?

**GLOU.**
==13==He is, and see, he brings the Mayor along.

*Enter the Mayor and Catesby.*

**BUCK.**
==14==Lord Mayor⁠—

**GLOU.**
==15==Look to the drawbridge there!

**BUCK.**
==16==Hark, a drum!

**GLOU.**
==17==Catesby, o’erlook the walls.

**BUCK.**
==18==Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent⁠—

**GLOU.**
==19==Look back, defend thee, here are enemies!

**BUCK.**
==20==God and our innocence defend and guard us!

*Enter Lovel and Ratcliffe with Hastings’ head.*

**GLOU.**
==21==Be patient, they are friends—Ratcliffe and Lovel.

**LOV.**
==22==Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
==23==The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

**GLOU.**
==24==So dear I lov’d the man that I must weep.
==25==I took him for the plainest harmless creature
==26==That breath’d upon the earth a Christian;
==27==Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded
==28==The history of all her secret thoughts.
==29==So smooth he daub’d his vice with show of virtue
==30==That, his apparent open guilt omitted⁠—
==31==I mean, his conversation with Shore’s wife⁠—
==32==He liv’d from all attainder of suspects.

**BUCK.**
==33==Well, well, he was the covert’st shelt’red traitor
==34==That ever liv’d. Look ye, my Lord Mayor,
==35==Would you imagine, or almost believe,
==36==Were’t not that by great preservation
==37==We live to tell it, that the subtile traitor
==38==This day had plotted, in the Council-house,
==39==To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?

**MAY.**
==40==Had he done so?

**GLOU.**
==41==What? Think you we are Turks or infidels?
==42==Or that we would, against the form of law,
==43==Proceed thus rashly in the villain’s death,
==44==But that the extreme peril of the case,
==45==The peace of England, and our persons’ safety,
==46==Enforc’d us to this execution?

**MAY.**
==47==Now fair befall you! He deserv’d his death,
==48==And your good Graces both have well proceeded,
==49==To warn false traitors from the like attempts.

**BUCK.**
==50==I never look’d for better at his hands
==51==After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
==52==Yet had we not determin’d he should die
==53==Until your lordship came to see his end,
==54==Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
==55==Something against our meanings, have prevented;
==56==Because, my lord, I would have had you heard
==57==The traitor speak, and timorously confess
==58==The manner and the purpose of his treasons,
==59==That you might well have signified the same
==60==Unto the citizens, who haply may
==61==Misconster us in him and wail his death.

**MAY.**
==62==But, my good lord, your Grace’s words shall serve
==63==As well as I had seen, and heard him speak;
==64==And do not doubt, right noble princes both,
==65==That I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens
==66==With all your just proceedings in this cause.

**GLOU.**
==67==And to that end we wish’d your lordship here,
==68==T’ avoid the censures of the carping world.

**BUCK.**
==69==Which since you come too late of our intent,
==70==Yet witness what you hear we did intend.
==71==And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.

*Exit Mayor.*

**GLOU.**
==72==Go after, after, cousin Buckingham.
==73==The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post.
==74==There, at your meet’st advantage of the time,
==75==Infer the bastardy of Edward’s children.
==76==Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen
==77==Only for saying he would make his son
==78==Heir to the Crown—meaning indeed his house,
==79==Which by the sign thereof was termed so.
==80==Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
==81==And bestial appetite in change of lust,
==82==Which stretch’d unto their servants, daughters, wives,
==83==Even where his raging eye or savage heart,
==84==Without control, lusted to make a prey.
==85==Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
==86==Tell them, when that my mother went with child
==87==Of that insatiate Edward, noble York,
==88==My princely father, then had wars in France,
==89==And by true computation of the time,
==90==Found that the issue was not his begot;
==91==Which well appeared in his lineaments,
==92==Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.
==93==Yet touch this sparingly, as ’twere far off,
==94==Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.

**BUCK.**
==95==Doubt not, my lord, I’ll play the orator
==96==As if the golden fee for which I plead
==97==Were for myself—and so, my lord, *adieu*.

**GLOU.**
==98==If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard’s Castle,
==99==Where you shall find me well accompanied
==100==With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.

**BUCK.**
==101==I go, and towards three or four a’ clock
==102==Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.

*Exit Buckingham.*

**GLOU.**
==103==Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
*(To Catesby.)*
==104==Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
==105==Meet me within this hour at Baynard’s Castle.
*(Exeunt Lovel and Catesby.)*
*(To Ratcliffe.)*
==106==Now will I go to take some privy order
==107==To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,
==108==And to give order that no manner person
==109==Have any time recourse unto the Princes.

*Exeunt.*
