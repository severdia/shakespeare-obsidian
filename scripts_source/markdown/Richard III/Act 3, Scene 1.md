## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*London. A street.*

*The trumpets sound. Enter young Prince Edward, the Dukes of Gloucester and Buckingham, Lord Cardinal Bourchier, Catesby, with others.*

**BUCK.**
==1== Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your chamber.

**GLOU.**
==2== Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts’ sovereign,
==3== The weary way hath made you melancholy.

**PRINCE.**
==4== No, uncle, but our crosses on the way
==5== Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.
==6== I want more uncles here to welcome me.

**GLOU.**
==7== Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your years
==8== Hath not yet div’d into the world’s deceit;
==9== Nor more can you distinguish of a man
==10== Than of his outward show, which, God he knows,
==11== Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
==12== Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
==13== Your Grace attended to their sug’red words,
==14== But look’d not on the poison of their hearts.
==15== God keep you from them, and from such false friends!

**PRINCE.**
==16== God keep me from false friends!—but they were none.

**GLOU.**
==17== My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet you.

*Enter Lord Mayor and his Train.*

**MAY.**
==18== God bless your Grace with health and happy days!

**PRINCE.**
==19== I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.
*(Mayor and Train stand aside.)*
==20== I thought my mother and my brother York
==21== Would long ere this have met us on the way.
==22== Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
==23== To tell us whether they will come or no!

*Enter Lord Hastings.*

**BUCK.**
==24== And in good time, here comes the sweating lord.

**PRINCE.**
==25== Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?

**HAST.**
==26== On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
==27== The Queen your mother and your brother York
==28== Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince
==29== Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,
==30== But by his mother was perforce withheld.

**BUCK.**
==31== Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
==32== Is this of hers! Lord Cardinal, will your Grace
==33== Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York
==34== Unto his princely brother presently?
==35== If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
==36== And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.

**CARD.**
==37== My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
==38== Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
==39== Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
==40== To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
==41== We should infringe the holy privilege
==42== Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land
==43== Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.

**BUCK.**
==44== You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,
==45== Too ceremonious and traditional.
==46== Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
==47== You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
==48== The benefit thereof is always granted
==49== To those whose dealings have deserv’d the place
==50== And those who have the wit to claim the place.
==51== This prince hath neither claim’d it nor deserv’d it,
==52== And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.
==53== Then taking him from thence that is not there,
==54== You break no privilege nor charter there.
==55== Oft have I heard of sanctuary men,
==56== But sanctuary children never till now.

**CARD.**
==57== My lord, you shall overrule my mind for once.
==58== Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?

**HAST.**
==59== I go, my lord.

**PRINCE.**
==60== Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
*(Exeunt Cardinal and Lord Hastings.)*
==61== Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
==62== Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?

**GLOU.**
==63== Where it seems best unto your royal self.
==64== If I may counsel you, some day or two
==65== Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower;
==66== Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
==67== For your best health and recreation.

**PRINCE.**
==68== I do not like the Tower, of any place.
==69== Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?

**BUCK.**
==70== He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,
==71== Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.

**PRINCE.**
==72== Is it upon record, or else reported
==73== Successively from age to age, he built it?

**BUCK.**
==74== Upon record, my gracious lord.

**PRINCE.**
==75== But say, my lord, it were not regist’red,
==76== Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
==77== As ’twere retail’d to all posterity,
==78== Even to the general all-ending day.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside.)*
==79== So wise so young, they say do never live long.

**PRINCE.**
==80== What say you, uncle?

**GLOU.**
==81== I say, without characters fame lives long.
*(Aside.)*
==82== Thus, like the formal Vice, Iniquity,
==83== I moralize two meanings in one word.

**PRINCE.**
==84== That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
==85== With what his valor did enrich his wit,
==86== His wit set down to make his valor live.
==87== Death makes no conquest of this conqueror,
==88== For now he lives in fame though not in life.
==89== I’ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham⁠—

**BUCK.**
==90== What, my gracious lord?

**PRINCE.**
==91== And if I live until I be a man,
==92== I’ll win our ancient right in France again,
==93== Or die a soldier as I liv’d a king.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside.)*
==94== Short summers lightly have a forward spring.

*Enter young York, Hastings, Cardinal Bourchier.*

**BUCK.**
==95== Now in good time, here comes the Duke of York.

**PRINCE.**
==96== Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?

**YORK.**
==97== Well, my dread lord—so must I call you now.

**PRINCE.**
==98== Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours.
==99== Too late he died that might have kept that title,
==100== Which by his death hath lost much majesty.

**GLOU.**
==101== How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?

**YORK.**
==102== I thank you, gentle uncle. O my lord,
==103== You said that idle weeds are fast in growth:
==104== The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.

**GLOU.**
==105== He hath, my lord.

**YORK.**
==106== And therefore is he idle?

**GLOU.**
==107== O my fair cousin, I must not say so.

**YORK.**
==108== Then he is more beholding to you than I.

**GLOU.**
==109== He may command me as my sovereign,
==110== But you have power in me as in a kinsman.

**YORK.**
==111== I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.

**GLOU.**
==112== My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart.

**PRINCE.**
==113== A beggar, brother?

**YORK.**
==114== Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,
==115== And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.

**GLOU.**
==116== A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.

**YORK.**
==117== A greater gift? O, that’s the sword to it.

**GLOU.**
==118== Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.

**YORK.**
==119== O then I see you will part but with light gifts!
==120== In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.

**GLOU.**
==121== It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.

**YORK.**
==122== I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.

**GLOU.**
==123== What, would you have my weapon, little lord?

**YORK.**
==124== I would, that I might thank you as you call me.

**GLOU.**
==125== How?

**YORK.**
==126== Little.

**PRINCE.**
==127== My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.
==128== Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.

**YORK.**
==129== You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.
==130== Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me:
==131== Because that I am little, like an ape,
==132== He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.

**BUCK.**
*(Aside to Hastings)*
==133== With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
==134== To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
==135== He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
==136== So cunning and so young is wonderful.

**GLOU.**
==137== My lord, will’t please you pass along?
==138== Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
==139== Will to your mother, to entreat of her
==140== To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.

**YORK.**
==141== What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?

**PRINCE.**
==142== My Lord Protector needs will have it so.

**YORK.**
==143== I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.

**GLOU.**
==144== Why, what should you fear?

**YORK.**
==145== Marry, my uncle Clarence’ angry ghost.
==146== My grandam told me he was murd’red there.

**PRINCE.**
==147== I fear no uncles dead.

**GLOU.**
==148== Nor none that live, I hope.

**PRINCE.**
==149== And if they live, I hope I need not feat.
==150== But come, my lord; with a heavy heart,
==151== Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.

*A sennet. Exeunt Prince Edward, York, Hastings, Cardinal Bourchier, and others. Manent Richard, Buckingham, and Catesby.*

**BUCK.**
==152== Think you, my lord, this little prating York
==153== Was not incensed by his subtile mother
==154== To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?

**GLOU.**
==155== No doubt, no doubt. O, ’tis a perilous boy,
==156== Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable:
==157== He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.

**BUCK.**
==158== Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
==159== Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
==160== As closely to conceal what we impart.
==161== Thou know’st our reasons urg’d upon the way;
==162== What think’st thou? Is it not an easy matter
==163== To make William Lord Hastings of our mind
==164== For the installment of this noble Duke
==165== In the seat royal of this famous isle?

**CATE.**
==166== He for his father’s sake so loves the Prince
==167== That he will not be won to aught against him.

**BUCK.**
==168== What think’st thou then of Stanley? Will not he?

**CATE.**
==169== He will do all in all as Hastings doth.

**BUCK.**
==170== Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
==171== And as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings
==172== How he doth stand affected to our purpose,
==173== And summon him tomorrow to the Tower
==174== To sit about the coronation.
==175== If thou dost find him tractable to us,
==176== Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;
==177== If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,
==178== Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,
==179== And give us notice of his inclination;
==180== For we tomorrow hold divided Councils,
==181== Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ’d.

**GLOU.**
==182== Commend me to Lord William. Tell him, Catesby,
==183== His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
==184== Tomorrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle,
==185== And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,
==186== Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.

**BUCK.**
==187== Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.

**CATE.**
==188== My good lords both, with all the heed I can.

**GLOU.**
==189== Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?

**CATE.**
==190== You shall, my lord.

**GLOU.**
==191== At Crosby House, there shall you find us both.

*Exit Catesby.*

**BUCK.**
==192== Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive
==193== Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?

**GLOU.**
==194== Chop off his head! Something we will determine.
==195== And look when I am king, claim thou of me
==196== The earldom of Herford, and all the moveables
==197== Whereof the King my brother was possess’d.

**BUCK.**
==198== I’ll claim that promise at your Grace’s hand.

**GLOU.**
==199== And look to have it yielded with all kindness.
==200== Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
==201== We may digest our complots in some form.

*Exeunt.*
