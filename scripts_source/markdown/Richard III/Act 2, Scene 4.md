## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*London. The palace.*

*Enter Archbishop of York, the young Duke of York, the Queen Elizabeth, and the Duchess of York.*

**ARCH.**
==1==Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony-Stratford,
==2==And at Northampton they do rest tonight.
==3==Tomorrow, or next day, they will be here.

**DUCH.**
==4==I long with all my heart to see the Prince.
==5==I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==6==But I hear no; they say my son of York
==7==Has almost overta’en him in his growth.

**YORK.**
==8==Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.

**DUCH.**
==9==Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.

**YORK.**
==10==Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,
==11==My uncle Rivers talk’d how I did grow
==12==More than my brother. “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester,
==13==“Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace.”
==14==And since, methinks I would not grow so fast,
==15==Because sweet flow’rs are slow and weeds make haste.

**DUCH.**
==16==Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
==17==In him that did object the same to thee:
==18==He was the wretched’st thing when he was young,
==19==So long a-growing and so leisurely
==20==That if his rule were true, he should be gracious.

**ARCH.**
==21==And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.

**DUCH.**
==22==I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.

**YORK.**
==23==Now by my troth, if I had been rememb’red,
==24==I could have given my uncle’s Grace a flout,
==25==To touch his growth nearer than he touch’d mine.

**DUCH.**
==26==How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.

**YORK.**
==27==Marry (they say) my uncle grew so fast
==28==That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old;
==29==’Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
==30==Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.

**DUCH.**
==31==I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?

**YORK.**
==32==Grandam, his nurse.

**DUCH.**
==33==His nurse? Why, she was dead ere thou wast born.

**YORK.**
==34==If ’twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==35==A parlous boy! Go to, you are too shrewd.

**DUCH.**
==36==Good madam, be not angry with the child.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==37==Pitchers have ears.

*Enter Messenger to the Queen.*

**ARCH.**
==38==Here comes a messenger. What news?

**MESS. QUEEN.**
==39==Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==40==How doth the Prince?

**MESS. QUEEN.**
==40==           Well, madam, and in health.

**DUCH.**
==41==What is thy news?

**MESS. QUEEN.**
==42==Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
==43==And with them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.

**DUCH.**
==44==Who hath committed them?

**MESS. QUEEN.**
==44==                The mighty dukes,
==45==Gloucester and Buckingham.

**ARCH.**
==45==                For what offense?

**MESS. QUEEN.**
==46==The sum of all I can I have disclos’d.
==47==Why, or for what, the nobles were committed
==48==Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==49==Ay me! I see the ruin of my house:
==50==The tiger now hath seiz’d the gentle hind;
==51==Insulting tyranny begins to jut
==52==Upon the innocent and aweless throne.
==53==Welcome destruction, blood, and massacre!
==54==I see (as in a map) the end of all.

**DUCH.**
==55==Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
==56==How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
==57==My husband lost his life to get the crown,
==58==And often up and down my sons were toss’d
==59==For me to joy and weep their gain and loss;
==60==And being seated, and domestic broils
==61==Clean overblown, themselves, the conquerors,
==62==Make war upon themselves, brother to brother,
==63==Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous
==64==And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,
==65==Or let me die, to look on death no more!

**Q. ELIZ.**
==66==Come, come, my boy, we will to sanctuary.
==67==Madam, farewell.

**DUCH.**
==67==           Stay, I will go with you.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==68==You have no cause.

**ARCH.**
*(To the Queen.)*
==69==My gracious lady, go,
==70==And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
==71==For my part, I’ll resign unto your Grace
==72==The seal I keep, and so betide to me
==73==As well I tender you and all of yours!
==74==Go, I’ll conduct you to the sanctuary.

*Exeunt.*
