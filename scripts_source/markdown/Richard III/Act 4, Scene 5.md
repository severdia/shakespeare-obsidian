## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Lord Stanley’s house.*

*Enter Stanley the Earl of Derby, and Sir Christopher Urswick, a priest.*

**STAN.**
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
That in the sty of the most deadly boar
My son George Stanley is frank’d up in hold;
If I revolt, off goes young George’s head;
The fear of that holds off my present aid.
So get thee gone; commend me to thy lord.
Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented
He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

**CHRIS.**
At Pembroke or at Ha’rford-West in Wales.

**STAN.**
What men of name resort to him?

**CHRIS.**
Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier,
Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew,
And many other of great name and worth;
And towards London do they bend their power,
If by the way they be not fought withal.

**STAN.**
Well, hie thee to thy lord; I kiss his hand.
My letter will resolve him of my mind.
Farewell.

*Exeunt.*
