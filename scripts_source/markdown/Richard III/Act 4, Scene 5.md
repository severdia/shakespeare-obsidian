[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Lord Stanley’s house.*

*Enter Stanley the Earl of Derby, and Sir Christopher Urswick, a priest.*

**STAN.**
==1== Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
==2== That in the sty of the most deadly boar
==3== My son George Stanley is frank’d up in hold;
==4== If I revolt, off goes young George’s head;
==5== The fear of that holds off my present aid.
==6== So get thee gone; commend me to thy lord.
==7== Withal say that the Queen hath heartily consented
==8== He should espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
==9== But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

**CHRIS.**
==10== At Pembroke or at Ha’rford-West in Wales.

**STAN.**
==11== What men of name resort to him?

**CHRIS.**
==12== Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier,
==13== Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley,
==14== Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
==15== And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant crew,
==16== And many other of great name and worth;
==17== And towards London do they bend their power,
==18== If by the way they be not fought withal.

**STAN.**
==19== Well, hie thee to thy lord; I kiss his hand.
==20== My letter will resolve him of my mind.
==21== Farewell.

*Exeunt.*
