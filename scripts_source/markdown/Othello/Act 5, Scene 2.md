## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]]

*A bedchamber in the castle.*

*Enter Othello with a light and Desdemona in her bed asleep.*

**OTH.**
==1==It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul;
==2==Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars,
==3==It is the cause. Yet I’ll not shed her blood,
==4==Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
==5==And smooth as monumental alabaster.
==6==Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.
==7==Put out the light, and then put out the light:
==8==If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
==9==I can again thy former light restore,
==10==Should I repent me; but once put out thy light,
==11==Thou cunning’st pattern of excelling nature,
==12==I know not where is that Promethean heat
==13==That can thy light relume. When I have pluck’d thy rose,
==14==I cannot give it vital growth again,
==15==It needs must wither. I’ll smell thee on the tree.
*(Kisses her.)*
==16==O balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
==17==Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
==18==Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee
==19==And love thee after. One more, and that’s the last.
==20==So sweet was ne’er so fatal. I must weep,
==21==But they are cruel tears. This sorrow’s heavenly,
==22==It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

**DES.**
==23==Who’s there? Othello?

**OTH.**
==23==              Ay, Desdemona.

**DES.**
==24==Will you come to bed, my lord?

**OTH.**
==25==Have you pray’d tonight, Desdemon?

**DES.**
==25==                     Ay, my lord.

**OTH.**
==26==If you bethink yourself of any crime
==27==Unreconcil’d as yet to heaven and grace,
==28==Solicit for it straight.

**DES.**
==29==Alack, my lord, what may you mean by that?

**OTH.**
==30==Well, do it, and be brief, I will walk by.
==31==I would not kill thy unprepared spirit,
==32==No, heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

**DES.**
==33==Talk you of killing?

**OTH.**
==33==           Ay, I do.

**DES.**
==33==                  Then heaven
==34==Have mercy on me!

**OTH.**
==34==           Amen, with all my heart!

**DES.**
==35==If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

**OTH.**
==36==Humh!

**DES.**
==37==And yet I fear you; for you’re fatal then
==38==When your eyes roll so. Why I should fear I know not,
==39==Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

**OTH.**
==40==Think on thy sins.

**DES.**
==40==           They are loves I bear to you.

**OTH.**
==41==Ay, and for that thou di’st.

**DES.**
==42==That death’s unnatural that kills for loving.
==43==Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
==44==Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.
==45==These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
==46==They do not point on me.

**OTH.**
==46==              Peace, and be still!

**DES.**
==47==I will so. What’s the matter?

**OTH.**
==48==That handkerchief which I so lov’d, and gave thee,
==49==Thou gav’st to Cassio.

**DES.**
==49==              No, by my life and soul!
==50==Send for the man, and ask him.

**OTH.**
==50==                Sweet soul, take heed,
==51==Take heed of perjury, thou art on thy death-bed.

**DES.**
==52==Ay, but not yet to die.

**OTH.**
==52==              Yes, presently:
==53==Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
==54==For to deny each article with oath
==55==Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
==56==That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

**DES.**
==57==Then Lord have mercy on me!

**OTH.**
==57==                  I say, amen.

**DES.**
==58==And have you mercy too! I never did
==59==Offend you in my life; never lov’d Cassio
==60==But with such general warranty of heaven
==61==As I might love. I never gave him token.

**OTH.**
==62==By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in ’s hand.
==63==O perjur’d woman, thou dost stone my heart,
==64==And mak’st me call what I intend to do
==65==A murder, which I thought a sacrifice.
==66==I saw the handkerchief.

**DES.**
==66==              He found it then;
==67==I never gave it him. Send for him hither;
==68==Let him confess a truth.

**OTH.**
==68==              He hath confess’d.

**DES.**
==69==What, my lord?

**OTH.**
==70==That he hath us’d thee.

**DES.**
==70==              How? Unlawfully?

**OTH.**
==70==                         Ay.

**DES.**
==71==He will not say so.

**OTH.**
==71==           No—his mouth is stopp’d;
==72==Honest Iago hath ta’en order for’t.

**DES.**
==73==O, my fear interprets. What, is he dead?

**OTH.**
==74==Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
==75==Had stomach for them all.

**DES.**
==76==Alas, he is betray’d and I undone!

**OTH.**
==77==Out, strumpet! Weep’st thou for him to my face?

**DES.**
==78==O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

**OTH.**
==79==Down, strumpet!d

**DES.**
==80==Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight!

**OTH.**
==81==Nay, an’ you strive⁠—

**DES.**
==82==But half an hour!

**OTH.**
==82==           Being done, there is no pause.

**DES.**
==83==But while I say one prayer!

**OTH.**
==83==              It is too late.

*Smothers her.*

**DES.**
==84==O Lord, Lord, Lord!

**EMIL.**
*(At the door, within.)*
==85==My lord, my lord!
==86==What ho! My lord, my lord!

**OTH.**
==87==What noise is this? Not dead? Not yet quite dead?
==88==I that am cruel am yet merciful,
==89==I would not have thee linger in thy pain.
==90==So, so.

**EMIL.**
*(Within.)*
==90==    What ho! My lord, my lord!

**OTH.**
==90==                  Who’s there?

**EMIL.**
*(Within.)*
==91==O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

**OTH.**
==92==Yes.—’Tis Emilia.—By and by.—She’s dead.
==93==’Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio’s death;
==94==The noise was high. Hah, no more moving?
==95==Still as the grave. Shall she come in? Were’t good?
==96==I think she stirs again. No. What’s best to do?
==97==If she come in, she’ll sure speak to my wife.
==98==My wife, my wife! What wife? I have no wife.
==99==O insupportable! O heavy hour!
==100==Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
==101==Of sun and moon, and that th’ affrighted globe
==102==Did yawn at alteration.

**EMIL.**
*(Within.)*
==102==              I do beseech you
==103==That I may speak with you. O, good my lord!

**OTH.**
==104==I had forgot thee. O, come in, Emilia.⁠—
==105==Soft, by and by, let me the curtains draw.⁠—
==106==Where art thou?
*(Unlocks the door.)*
*(Enter Emilia.)*
==106==        What’s the matter with thee now?

**EMIL.**
==107==O, my good lord, yonder’s foul murders done!

**OTH.**
==108==What? Now?

**EMIL.**
==109==But now, my lord.

**OTH.**
==110==It is the very error of the moon,
==111==She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
==112==And makes men mad.

**EMIL.**
==113==Cassio, my lord, hath kill’d a young Venetian
==114==Call’d Roderigo.

**OTH.**
==114==        Roderigo kill’d?
==115==And Cassio kill’d?

**EMIL.**
==115==           No, Cassio is not kill’d.

**OTH.**
==116==Not Cassio kill’d? Then murder’s out of tune,
==117==And sweet revenge grows harsh.

**DES.**
==118==O, falsely, falsely murder’d!

**EMIL.**
==118==              O Lord, what cry is that?

**OTH.**
==119==That? What?

**EMIL.**
==120==Out, and alas, that was my lady’s voice.
==121==Help, help, ho, help! O lady, speak again!
==122==Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!

**DES.**
==123==A guiltless death I die.

**EMIL.**
==124==O, who hath done this deed?

**DES.**
==125==Nobody; I myself. Farewell!
==126==Commend me to my kind lord. O, farewell!

*Dies.*

**OTH.**
==127==Why, how should she be murd’red?

**EMIL.**
==127==                  Alas! Who knows?

**OTH.**
==128==You heard her say herself, it was not I.

**EMIL.**
==129==She said so; I must needs report the truth.

**OTH.**
==130==She’s like a liar gone to burning hell:
==131==’Twas I that kill’d her.

**EMIL.**
==131==           O, the more angel she,
==132==And you the blacker devil!

**OTH.**
==133==She turn’d to folly, and she was a whore.

**EMIL.**
==134==Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

**OTH.**
==135==She was false as water.

**EMIL.**
==135==           Thou art rash as fire to say
==136==That she was false. O, she was heavenly true!

**OTH.**
==137==Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
==138==O, I were damn’d beneath all depth in hell
==139==But that I did proceed upon just grounds
==140==To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

**EMIL.**
==141==My husband?

**OTH.**
==142==Thy husband.

**EMIL.**
==143==That she was false to wedlock?

**OTH.**
==144==Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
==145==If heaven would make me such another world
==146==Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,
==147==I’ld not have sold her for it.

**EMIL.**
==147==                My husband?

**OTH.**
==148==Ay, ’twas he that told me on her first.
==149==An honest man he is, and hates the slime
==150==That sticks on filthy deeds.

**EMIL.**
==150==                My husband?

**OTH.**
==151==What needs this iterance, woman? I say thy husband.

**EMIL.**
==152==O mistress, villainy hath made mocks with love!
==153==My husband say she was false?

**OTH.**
==153==                  He, woman:
==154==I say thy husband; dost understand the word?
==155==My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

**EMIL.**
==156==If he say so, may his pernicious soul
==157==Rot half a grain a day! He lies to th’ heart.
==158==She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

**OTH.**
==159==Hah?

**EMIL.**
==160==Do thy worst!
==161==This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
==162==Than thou wast worthy her.

**OTH.**
==162==              Peace, you were best.

**EMIL.**
==163==Thou hast not half that pow’r to do me harm
==164==As I have to be hurt. O gull, O dolt,
==165==As ignorant as dirt! Thou hast done a deed⁠—
==166==I care not for thy sword, I’ll make thee known,
==167==Though I lost twenty lives. Help, help, ho, help!
==168==The Moor hath kill’d my mistress! Murder, murder!

*Enter Montano, Gratiano, and Iago, with others.*

**MON.**
==169==What is the matter? How now, general?

**EMIL.**
==170==O, are you come, Iago? You have done well,
==171==That men must lay their murders on your neck.

**GRA.**
==172==What is the matter?

**EMIL.**
==173==Disprove this villain, if thou be’st a man.
==174==He says thou toldst him that his wife was false.
==175==I know thou didst not; thou’rt not such a villain.
==176==Speak, for my heart is full.

**IAGO.**
==177==I told him what I thought, and told no more
==178==Than what he found himself was apt and true.

**EMIL.**
==179==But did you ever tell him she was false?

**IAGO.**
==180==I did.

**EMIL.**
==181==You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
==182==Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
==183==She false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio?

**IAGO.**
==184==With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.

**EMIL.**
==185==I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak.
==186==My mistress here lies murdered in her bed⁠—

**ALL.**
==187==O heavens forfend!

**EMIL.**
==188==And your reports have set the murder on.

**OTH.**
==189==Nay, stare not, masters, it is true indeed.

**GRA.**
==190==’Tis a strange truth.

**MON.**
==191==O monstrous act!

**EMIL.**
==191==           Villainy, villainy, villainy!
==192==I think upon’t, I think—I smell’t—O villainy!
==193==I thought so then—I’ll kill myself for grief⁠—
==194==O villainy! Villainy!

**IAGO.**
==195==What, are you mad? I charge you get you home.

**EMIL.**
==196==Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak.
==197==’Tis proper I obey him; but not now.
==198==Perchance, Iago, I will ne’er go home.

**OTH.**
==199==O, O, O!

*Othello falls on the bed.*

**EMIL.**
==199==        Nay, lay thee down and roar;
==200==For thou hast kill’d the sweetest innocent
==201==That e’er did lift up eye.

**OTH.**
*(Rising.)*
==201==              O, she was foul!
==202==I scarce did know you, uncle; there lies your niece,
==203==Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp’d.
==204==I know this act shows horrible and grim.

**GRA.**
==205==Poor Desdemon! I am glad thy father’s dead.
==206==Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
==207==Shore his old thread in twain. Did he live now,
==208==This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
==209==Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
==210==And fall to reprobance.

**OTH.**
==211==’Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
==212==That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
==213==A thousand times committed. Cassio confess’d it,
==214==And she did gratify his amorous works
==215==With that recognizance and pledge of love
==216==Which I first gave her. I saw it in his hand;
==217==It was a handkerchief, an antique token
==218==My father gave my mother.

**EMIL.**
==219==O God! O heavenly God!

**IAGO.**
==220==’Zounds, hold your peace.

**EMIL.**
==220==              ’Twill out, ’twill out! I peace?
==221==No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
==222==Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
==223==All, all, cry shame against me, yet I’ll speak.

**IAGO.**
==224==Be wise, and get you home.

**EMIL.**
==224==                I will not.

*Iago offers to stab Emilia.*

**GRA.**
==224==                         Fie,
==225==Your sword upon a woman?

**EMIL.**
==226==O thou dull Moor, that handkerchief thou speak’st of
==227==I found by fortune, and did give my husband;
==228==For often, with a solemn earnestness
==229==(More than indeed belong’d to such a trifle),
==230==He begg’d of me to steal’t.

**IAGO.**
==230==              Villainous whore!

**EMIL.**
==231==She give it Cassio? No, alas, I found it,
==232==And I did give’t my husband.

**IAGO.**
==232==                Filth, thou liest!

**EMIL.**
==233==By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
==234==O murd’rous coxcomb, what should such a fool
==235==Do with so good a wife?

**OTH.**
==235==              Are there no stones in heaven
==236==But what serves for the thunder?—Precious villain!

*The Moor runs at Iago; Montano disarms Othello.*

*Iago kills his wife.*

**GRA.**
==237==The woman falls; sure he hath kill’d his wife.

**EMIL.**
==238==Ay, ay! O, lay me by my mistress’ side.

*Exit Iago.*

**GRA.**
==239==He’s gone, but his wife’s kill’d.

**MON.**
==240==’Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon
==241==Which I have here recover’d from the Moor.
==242==Come guard the door without; let him not pass,
==243==But kill him rather. I’ll after that same villain,
==244==For ’tis a damned slave.

*Exit with all but Othello and Emilia.*

**OTH.**
==244==              I am not valiant neither,
==245==But every puny whipster gets my sword.
==246==But why should honor outlive honesty?
==247==Let it go all.

**EMIL.**
==247==        What did thy song bode, lady?
==248==Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan,
==249==And die in music.
*(Sings.)*
==250== *Willow, willow, willow.*
==251==Moor, she was chaste; she lov’d thee, cruel Moor;
==252==So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
==253==So speaking as I think, alas, I die.

*Dies.*

**OTH.**
==254==I have another weapon in this chamber;
==255==It was a sword of Spain, the ice-brook’s temper⁠—
==256==O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.

**GRA.**
*(Within.)*
==257==If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:
==258==Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.

**OTH.**
==259==Look in upon me then and speak with me,
==260==Or naked as I am I will assault thee.

*Enter Gratiano.*

**GRA.**
==261==What is the matter?

**OTH.**
==261==           Behold, I have a weapon;
==262==A better never did itself sustain
==263==Upon a soldier’s thigh. I have seen the day
==264==That with this little arm, and this good sword,
==265==I have made my way through more impediments
==266==Than twenty times your stop. But (O vain boast!) 
==267==Who can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.
==268==Be not afraid though you do see me weapon’d;
==269==Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt
==270==And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
==271==Do you go back dismay’d? ’Tis a lost fear;
==272==Man but a rush against Othello’s breast,
==273==And he retires. Where should Othello go?
==274==Now—how dost thou look now? O ill-starr’d wench,
==275==Pale as thy smock! When we shall meet at compt,
==276==This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
==277==And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl?
==278==Even like thy chastity. O cursed, cursed slave!
==279==Whip me, ye devils,
==280==From the possession of this heavenly sight!
==281==Blow me about in winds! Roast me in sulfur!
==282==Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
==283==O Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! Dead!
==284==O, O!

*Enter Lodovico, Cassio in a chair, Montano, and Iago guarded, with Officers.*

**LOD.**
==285==Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

**OTH.**
==286==That’s he that was Othello; here I am.

**LOD.**
==287==Where is that viper? Bring the villain forth.

**OTH.**
==288==I look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.
==289==If that thou be’st a devil, I cannot kill thee.

*Wounds Iago.*

**LOD.**
==290==Wrench his sword from him.

**IAGO.**
==290==              I bleed, sir, but not kill’d.

**OTH.**
==291==I am not sorry neither, I’ld have thee live;
==292==For in my sense, ’tis happiness to die.

**LOD.**
==293==O thou Othello, that was once so good,
==294==Fall’n in the practice of a damned slave,
==295==What shall be said to thee?

**OTH.**
==295==              Why, any thing:
==296==An honorable murderer, if you will;
==297==For nought I did in hate, but all in honor.

**LOD.**
==298==This wretch hath part confess’d his villainy.
==299==Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?

**OTH.**
==300==Ay.

**CAS.**
==301==Dear general, I never gave you cause.

**OTH.**
==302==I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
==303==Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
==304==Why he hath thus ensnar’d my soul and body?

**IAGO.**
==305==Demand me nothing; what you know, you know:
==306==From this time forth I never will speak word.

**LOD.**
==307==What? Not to pray?

**GRA.**
==307==           Torments will ope your lips.

**OTH.**
==308==Well, thou dost best.

**LOD.**
==309==Sir, you shall understand what hath befall’n,
==310==Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
==311==Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,
==312==And here another. The one of them imports
==313==The death of Cassio to be undertook
==314==By Roderigo.

**OTH.**
==315==O villain!

**CAS.**
==315==        Most heathenish and most gross!

**LOD.**
==316==Now here’s another discontented paper,
==317==Found in his pocket too; and this it seems
==318==Roderigo meant t’ have sent this damned villain;
==319==But that, belike, Iago in the nick
==320==Came in and satisfied him.

**OTH.**
==320==              O thou pernicious caitiff!⁠—
==321==How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
==322==That was my wive’s?

**CAS.**
==322==           I found it in my chamber:
==323==And he himself confess’d it but even now,
==324==That there he dropp’d it for a special purpose
==325==Which wrought to his desire.

**OTH.**
==325==                O fool, fool, fool!

**CAS.**
==326==There is besides, in Roderigo’s letter,
==327==How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
==328==Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came
==329==That I was cast; and even but now he spake
==330==(After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,
==331==Iago set him on.

**LOD.**
==332==You must forsake this room and go with us.
==333==Your power and your command is taken off,
==334==And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
==335==If there be any cunning cruelty
==336==That can torment him much, and hold him long,
==337==It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
==338==Till that the nature of your fault be known
==339==To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.

**OTH.**
==340==Soft you; a word or two before you go.
==341==I have done the state some service, and they know’t⁠—
==342==No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
==343==When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
==344==Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
==345==Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak
==346==Of one that lov’d not wisely but too well;
==347==Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,
==348==Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand
==349==(Like the base Indian) threw a pearl away
==350==Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu’d eyes,
==351==Albeit unused to the melting mood,
==352==Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees
==353==Their medicinable gum. Set you down this;
==354==And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
==355==Where a malignant and a turban’d Turk
==356==Beat a Venetian and traduc’d the state,
==357==I took by th’ throat the circumcised dog,
==358==And smote him—thus.

*He stabs himself.*

**LOD.**
==359==O bloody period!

**GRA.**
==359==           All that is spoke is marr’d.

**OTH.**
==360==I kiss’d thee ere I kill’d thee. No way but this,
==361==Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

*Falls on the bed and dies.*

**CAS.**
==362==This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
==363==For he was great of heart.

**LOD.**
*(To Iago.)*
==363==              O Spartan dog,
==364==More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
==365==Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
==366==This is thy work. The object poisons sight,
==367==Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
==368==And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
==369==For they succeed on you. To you, Lord Governor,
==370==Remains the censure of this hellish villain,
==371==The time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it!
==372==Myself will straight aboard, and to the state
==373==This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

*Exeunt.*
