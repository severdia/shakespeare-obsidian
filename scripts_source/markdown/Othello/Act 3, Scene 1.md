## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Cyprus. Before the castle.*

*Enter Cassio with Musicians.*

**CAS.**
==1== Masters, play here, I will content your pains;
==2== Something that’s brief; and bid “Good morrow, general.”

*They play, and enter the Clown.*

**CLO.**
==3== Why, masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i’ th’ nose thus?

**1. MUS.**
==4== How, sir? How?

**CLO.**
==5== Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?

**1. MUS.**
==6== Ay, marry, are they, sir.

**CLO.**
==7== O, thereby hangs a tail.

**1. MUS.**
==8== Whereby hangs a tale, sir?

**CLO.**
==9== Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I know. But, masters, here’s money for you; and the general so likes your music, that he desires you for love’s sake to make no more noise with it.

**1. MUS.**
==10== Well, sir, we will not.

**CLO.**
==11== If you have any music that may not be heard, to’t again; but (as they say) to hear music the general does not greatly care.

**1. MUS.**
==12== We have none such, sir.

**CLO.**
==13== Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I’ll away. Go, vanish into air, away!

*Exeunt Musicians.*

**CAS.**
==14== Dost thou hear, mine honest friend?

**CLO.**
==15== No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.

**CAS.**
==16== Prithee keep up thy quillets. There’s a poor piece of gold for thee. If the gentlewoman that attends the general’s wife be stirring, tell her there’s one Cassio entreats her a little favor of speech. Wilt thou do this?

**CLO.**
==17== She is stirring, sir. If she will stir hither, I shall seem to notify unto her.

**CAS.**
==18== Do, good my friend.
*(Exit Clown.)*
*(Enter Iago.)*
==18==               In happy time, Iago.

**IAGO.**
==19== You have not been a-bed then?

**CAS.**
==20== Why, no; the day had broke
==21== Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
==22== To send in to your wife. My suit to her
==23== Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona
==24== Procure me some access.

**IAGO.**
==24==               I’ll send her to you presently;
==25== And I’ll devise a mean to draw the Moor
==26== Out of the way, that your converse and business
==27== May be more free.

**CAS.**
==28== I humbly thank you for’t.
*(Exit Iago.)*
==29== I never knew a Florentine more kind and honest.

*Enter Emilia.*

**EMIL.**
==30== Good morrow, good lieutenant. I am sorry
==31== For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
==32== The general and his wife are talking of it,
==33== And she speaks for you stoutly. The Moor replies
==34== That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
==35== And great affinity; and that in wholesome wisdom
==36== He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loves you,
==37== And needs no other suitor but his likings
==38== To take the safest occasion by the front
==39== To bring you in again.

**CAS.**
==39==            Yet I beseech you,
==40== If you think fit, or that it may be done,
==41== Give me advantage of some brief discourse
==42== With Desdemon alone.

**EMIL.**
==42==               Pray you come in.
==43== I will bestow you where you shall have time
==44== To speak your bosom freely.

**CAS.**
==44==               I am much bound to you.

*Exeunt.*
