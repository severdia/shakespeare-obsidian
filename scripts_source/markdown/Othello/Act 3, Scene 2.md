## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Cyprus. A room in the castle.*

*Enter Othello, Iago, and Gentlemen.*

**OTH.**
These letters give, Iago, to the pilot,
And by him do my duties to the Senate.
That done, I will be walking on the works;
Repair there to me.

**IAGO.**
           Well, my good lord, I’ll do’t.

**OTH.**
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see’t?

**GENTLEMEN.**
We’ll wait upon your lordship.

*Exeunt.*
