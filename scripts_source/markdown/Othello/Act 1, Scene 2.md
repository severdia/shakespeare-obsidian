## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Venice. Another street.*

*Enter Othello, Iago, Attendants with torches.*

**IAGO.**
==1== Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
==2== Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ th’ conscience
==3== To do no contriv’d murder. I lack iniquity
==4== Sometime to do me service. Nine or ten times
==5== I had thought t’ have yerk’d him here under the ribs.

**OTH.**
==6== ’Tis better as it is.

**IAGO.**
==6==            Nay, but he prated,
==7== And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
==8== Against your honor,
==9== That with the little godliness I have
==10== I did full hard forbear him. But I pray you, sir,
==11== Are you fast married? Be assur’d of this,
==12== That the magnifico is much belov’d,
==13== And hath in his effect a voice potential
==14== As double as the Duke’s. He will divorce you,
==15== Or put upon you what restraint or grievance
==16== The law (with all his might to enforce it on) 
==17== Will give him cable.

**OTH.**
==17==            Let him do his spite;
==18== My services which I have done the signiory
==19== Shall out—tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know⁠—
==20== Which, when I know that boasting is an honor,
==21== I shall provulgate—I fetch my life and being
==22== From men of royal siege, and my demerits
==23== May speak, unbonneted, to as proud a fortune
==24== As this that I have reach’d; for know, Iago,
==25== But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
==26== I would not my unhoused free condition
==27== Put into circumscription and confine
==28== For the sea’s worth. But look, what lights come yond?

*Enter Cassio with Officers and torches.*

**IAGO.**
==29== Those are the raised father and his friends.
==30== You were best go in.

**OTH.**
==30==            Not I; I must be found.
==31== My parts, my title, and my perfect soul
==32== Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

**IAGO.**
==33== By Janus, I think no.

**OTH.**
==34== The servants of the Duke? And my lieutenant?
==35== The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
==36== What is the news?

**CAS.**
==36==         The Duke does greet you, general,
==37== And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
==38== Even on the instant.

**OTH.**
==38==            What is the matter, think you?

**CAS.**
==39== Something from Cyprus, as I may divine;
==40== It is a business of some heat. The galleys
==41== Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
==42== This very night at one another’s heels;
==43== And many of the consuls, rais’d and met,
==44== Are at the Duke’s already. You have been hotly call’d for;
==45== When, being not at your lodging to be found,
==46== The Senate hath sent about three several quests
==47== To search you out.

**OTH.**
==47==            ’Tis well I am found by you.
==48== I will but spend a word here in the house,
==49== And go with you.

*Exit.*

**CAS.**
==49==            Ancient, what makes he here?

**IAGO.**
==50== Faith, he tonight hath boarded a land carrack.
==51== If it prove lawful prize, he’s made forever.

**CAS.**
==52== I do not understand.

**IAGO.**
==52==            He’s married.

**CAS.**
==52==                      To who?

*Enter Othello.*

**IAGO.**
==53== Marry, to—Come, captain, will you go?

**OTH.**
==53==                      Have with you.

**CAS.**
==54== Here comes another troop to seek for you.

*Enter Brabantio, Roderigo, with Officers with torches and weapons.*

**IAGO.**
==55== It is Brabantio. General, be advis’d,
==56== He comes to bad intent.

**OTH.**
==56==               Holla, stand there!

**ROD.**
==57== *Signior*, it is the Moor.

**BRA.**
==57==               Down with him, thief!

*They draw on both sides.*

**IAGO.**
==58== You, Roderigo! Come, sir, I am for you.

**OTH.**
==59== Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
==60== Good *signior*, you shall more command with years
==61== Than with your weapons.

**BRA.**
==62== O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow’d my daughter?
==63== Damn’d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her,
==64== For I’ll refer me to all things of sense,
==65== If she in chains of magic were not bound,
==66== Whether a maid so tender, fair, and happy,
==67== So opposite to marriage that she shunn’d
==68== The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
==69== Would ever have, t’ incur a general mock,
==70== Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
==71== Of such a thing as thou—to fear, not to delight!
==72== Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense,
==73== That thou hast practic’d on her with foul charms,
==74== Abus’d her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
==75== That weakens motion. I’ll have’t disputed on,
==76== ’Tis probable, and palpable to thinking.
==77== I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
==78== For an abuser of the world, a practicer
==79== Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
==80== Lay hold upon him, if he do resist
==81== Subdue him at his peril.

**OTH.**
==81==               Hold your hands,
==82== Both you of my inclining, and the rest.
==83== Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
==84== Without a prompter. Whither will you that I go
==85== To answer this your charge?

**BRA.**
==85==                 To prison, till fit time
==86== Of law and course of direct session
==87== Call thee to answer.

**OTH.**
==87==            What if I do obey?
==88== How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,
==89== Whose messengers are here about my side,
==90== Upon some present business of the state,
==91== To bring me to him?

**OFF.**
==91==            ’Tis true, most worthy *signior*;
==92== The Duke’s in council, and your noble self
==93== I am sure is sent for.

**BRA.**
==93==            How? The Duke in council?
==94== In this time of the night? Bring him away;
==95== Mine’s not an idle cause. The Duke himself,
==96== Or any of my brothers of the state,
==97== Cannot but feel this wrong as ’twere their own;
==98== For if such actions may have passage free,
==99== Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

*Exeunt.*
