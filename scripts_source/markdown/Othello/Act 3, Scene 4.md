## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Cyprus. Before the castle.*

*Enter Desdemona, Emilia, and Clown.*

**DES.**
==1== Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

**CLO.**
==2== I dare not say he lies any where.

**DES.**
==3== Why, man?

**CLO.**
==4== He’s a soldier, and for me to say a soldier lies, ’tis stabbing.

**DES.**
==5== Go to! Where lodges he?

**CLO.**
==6== To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

**DES.**
==7== Can any thing be made of this?

**CLO.**
==8== I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here, or he lies there, were to lie in mine own throat.

**DES.**
==9== Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?

**CLO.**
==10== I will catechize the world for him, that is, make questions, and by them answer.

**DES.**
==11== Seek him, bid him come hither. Tell him I have mov’d my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

**CLO.**
==12== To do this is within the compass of man’s wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it.

*Exit Clown.*

**DES.**
==13== Where should I lose the handkerchief, Emilia?

**EMIL.**
==14== I know not, madam.

**DES.**
==15== Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
==16== Full of crusadoes; and but my noble Moor
==17== Is true of mind, and made of no such baseness
==18== As jealous creatures are, it were enough
==19== To put him to ill thinking.

**EMIL.**
==19==               Is he not jealous?

**DES.**
==20== Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
==21== Drew all such humors from him.

**EMIL.**
==21==                 Look where he comes.

*Enter Othello.*

**DES.**
==22== I will not leave him now till Cassio
==23== Be call’d to him.—How is’t with you, my lord?

**OTH.**
==24== Well, my good lady.
*(Aside.)*
==24==            O, hardness to dissemble!⁠—
==25== How do you, Desdemona?

**DES.**
==25==               Well, my good lord.

**OTH.**
==26== Give me your hand. This hand is moist, my lady.

**DES.**
==27== It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

**OTH.**
==28== This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart;
==29== Hot, hot, and moist. This hand of yours requires
==30== A sequester from liberty: fasting and prayer,
==31== Much castigation, exercise devout,
==32== For here’s a young and sweating devil here
==33== That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,
==34== A frank one.

**DES.**
==34==         You may, indeed, say so;
==35== For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.

**OTH.**
==36== A liberal hand. The hearts of old gave hands;
==37== But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

**DES.**
==38== I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

**OTH.**
==39== What promise, chuck?

**DES.**
==40== I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

**OTH.**
==41== I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
==42== Lend me thy handkerchief.

**DES.**
==42==               Here, my lord.

**OTH.**
==43== That which I gave you.

**DES.**
==43==               I have it not about me.

**OTH.**
==44== Not?

**DES.**
==44==     No, faith, my lord.

**OTH.**
==45== That’s a fault. That handkerchief
==46== Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
==47== She was a charmer, and could almost read
==48== The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it,
==49== ’Twould make her amiable, and subdue my father
==50== Entirely to her love; but if she lost it,
==51== Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye
==52== Should hold her loathed, and his spirits should hunt
==53== After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,
==54== And bid me, when my fate would have me wiv’d,
==55== To give it her. I did so; and take heed on’t,
==56== Make it a darling like your precious eye.
==57== To lose’t or give’t away were such perdition
==58== As nothing else could match.

**DES.**
==58==                 Is’t possible?

**OTH.**
==59== ’Tis true; there’s magic in the web of it.
==60== A sibyl, that had numb’red in the world
==61== The sun to course two hundred compasses,
==62== In her prophetic fury sew’d the work;
==63== The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,
==64== And it was dy’d in mummy which the skillful
==65== Conserv’d of maidens’ hearts.

**DES.**
==65==                 I’ faith! Is’t true?

**OTH.**
==66== Most veritable, therefore look to’t well.

**DES.**
==67== Then would to God that I had never seen’t!

**OTH.**
==68== Ha? Wherefore?

**DES.**
==69== Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

**OTH.**
==70== Is’t lost? Is’t gone? Speak, is’t out o’ th’ way?

**DES.**
==71== Heaven bless us!

**OTH.**
==72== Say you?

**DES.**
==73== It is not lost; but what and if it were?

**OTH.**
==74== How?

**DES.**
==75== I say, it is not lost.

**OTH.**
==75==            Fetch’t, let me see’t.

**DES.**
==76== Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
==77== This is a trick to put me from my suit.
==78== Pray you let Cassio be receiv’d again.

**OTH.**
==79== Fetch me the handkerchief, my mind misgives.

**DES.**
==80== Come, come;
==81== You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.

**OTH.**
==82== The handkerchief!

**DES.**
==82==            I pray talk me of Cassio.

**OTH.**
==83== The handkerchief!

**DES.**
==83==            A man that all his time
==84== Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
==85== Shar’d dangers with you⁠—

**OTH.**
==86== The handkerchief!

**DES.**
==87== I’ faith, you are to blame.

**OTH.**
==88== ’Zounds!

*Exit Othello.*

**EMIL.**
==89== Is not this man jealous?

**DES.**
==90== I nev’r saw this before.
==91== Sure, there’s some wonder in this handkerchief;
==92== I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

**EMIL.**
==93== ’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
==94== They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
==95== They eat us hungerly, and when they are full
==96== They belch us.
*(Enter Iago and Cassio.)*
==96==         Look you, Cassio and my husband!

**IAGO.**
==97== There is no other way: ’tis she must do’t;
==98== And lo the happiness! Go, and importune her.

**DES.**
==99== How now, good Cassio, what’s the news with you?

**CAS.**
==100== Madam, my former suit. I do beseech you
==101== That by your virtuous means I may again
==102== Exist, and be a member of his love
==103== Whom I, with all the office of my heart,
==104== Entirely honor. I would not be delay’d.
==105== If my offense be of such mortal kind
==106== That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
==107== Nor purpos’d merit in futurity,
==108== Can ransom me into his love again,
==109== But to know so must be my benefit;
==110== So shall I clothe me in a forc’d content,
==111== And shut myself up in some other course,
==112== To fortune’s alms.

**DES.**
==112==            Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio,
==113== My advocation is not now in tune.
==114== My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him
==115== Were he in favor as in humor alter’d.
==116== So help me every spirit sanctified,
==117== As I have spoken for you all my best,
==118== And stood within the blank of his displeasure
==119== For my free speech! You must awhile be patient.
==120== What I can do, I will; and more I will
==121== Than for myself I dare. Let that suffice you.

**IAGO.**
==122== Is my lord angry?

**EMIL.**
==122==            He went hence but now;
==123== And certainly in strange unquietness.

**IAGO.**
==124== Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon
==125== When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
==126== And like the devil from his very arm
==127== Puff’d his own brother—and is he angry?
==128== Something of moment then. I will go meet him.
==129== There’s matter in’t indeed, if he be angry.

**DES.**
==130== I prithee do so.
*(Exit Iago.)*
==130==         Something sure of state,
==131== Either from Venice, or some unhatch’d practice
==132== Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
==133== Hath puddled his clear spirit; and in such cases
==134== Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,
==135== Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so;
==136== For let our finger ache, and it endues
==137== Our other healthful members even to a sense
==138== Of pain. Nay, we must think men are not gods,
==139== Nor of them look for such observancy
==140== As fits the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
==141== I was (unhandsome warrior as I am) 
==142== Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
==143== But now I find I had suborn’d the witness,
==144== And he’s indicted falsely.

**EMIL.**
==145== Pray heaven it be state matters, as you think,
==146== And no conception nor no jealous toy
==147== Concerning you.

**DES.**
==148== Alas the day, I never gave him cause.

**EMIL.**
==149== But jealous souls will not be answer’d so;
==150== They are not ever jealous for the cause,
==151== But jealous for they’re jealous. It is a monster
==152== Begot upon itself, born on itself.

**DES.**
==153== Heaven keep the monster from Othello’s mind!

**EMIL.**
==154== Lady, amen.

**DES.**
==155== I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout;
==156== If I do find him fit, I’ll move your suit
==157== And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

**CAS.**
==158== I humbly thank your ladyship.

*Exeunt Desdemona and Emilia.*

*Enter Bianca.*

**BIAN.**
==159== ’Save you, friend Cassio!

**CAS.**
==159==               What make you from home?
==160== How is’t with you, my most fair Bianca?
==161== I’faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

**BIAN.**
==162== And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
==163== What? Keep a week away? Seven days and nights?
==164== Eightscore eight hours? And lovers’ absent hours,
==165== More tedious than the dial eightscore times?
==166== O weary reck’ning!

**CAS.**
==166==            Pardon me, Bianca.
==167== I have this while with leaden thoughts been press’d,
==168== But I shall in a more continuate time
==169== Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
*(Giving her Desdemona’s handkerchief.)*
==170== Take me this work out.

**BIAN.**
==170==            O Cassio, whence came this?
==171== This is some token from a newer friend;
==172== To the felt absence now I feel a cause.
==173== Is’t come to this? Well, well.

**CAS.**
==173==                 Go to, woman!
==174== Throw your vild guesses in the devil’s teeth,
==175== From whence you have them. You are jealous now
==176== That this is from some mistress, some remembrance;
==177== No, by my faith, Bianca.

**BIAN.**
==177==               Why, whose is it?

**CAS.**
==178== I know not, neither; I found it in my chamber.
==179== I like the work well; ere it be demanded
==180== (As like enough it will) I would have it copied.
==181== Take it, and do’t, and leave me for this time.

**BIAN.**
==182== Leave you? Wherefore?

**CAS.**
==183== I do attend here on the general,
==184== And think it no addition, nor my wish,
==185== To have him see me woman’d.

**BIAN.**
==185==                 Why, I pray you?

**CAS.**
==186== Not that I love you not.

**BIAN.**
==186==            But that you do not love me.
==187== I pray you bring me on the way a little,
==188== And say if I shall see you soon at night.

**CAS.**
==189== ’Tis but a little way that I can bring you,
==190== For I attend here; but I’ll see you soon.

**BIAN.**
==191== ’Tis very good; I must be circumstanc’d.

*Exeunt omnes.*
