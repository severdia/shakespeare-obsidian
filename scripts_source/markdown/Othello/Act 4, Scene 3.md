## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Cyprus. Another room in the castle.*

*Enter Othello, Lodovico, Desdemona, Emilia, and Attendants.*

**LOD.**
==1== I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

**OTH.**
==2== O, pardon me; ’twill do me good to walk.

**LOD.**
==3== Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

**DES.**
==4== Your honor is most welcome.

**OTH.**
==4==                 Will you walk, sir?
==5== O, Desdemona!

**DES.**
==6== My lord?

**OTH.**
==7== Get you to bed on th’ instant, I will be return’d forthwith. Dismiss your attendant there. Look’t be done.

**DES.**
==8== I will, my lord.

*Exeunt Othello, Lodovico, and Attendants.*

**EMIL.**
==9== How goes it now? He looks gentler than he did.

**DES.**
==10== He says he will return incontinent,
==11== And hath commanded me to go to bed,
==12== And bid me to dismiss you.

**EMIL.**
==12==               Dismiss me?

**DES.**
==13== It was his bidding; therefore, good Emilia,
==14== Give me my nightly wearing, and *adieu*.
==15== We must not now displease him.

**EMIL.**
==16== I would you had never seen him!

**DES.**
==17== So would not I. My love doth so approve him,
==18== That even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns⁠—
==19== Prithee unpin me—have grace and favor in them.

**EMIL.**
==20== I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

**DES.**
==21== All’s one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
==22== If I do die before thee, prithee shroud me
==23== In one of these same sheets.

**EMIL.**
==23==                 Come, come; you talk.

**DES.**
==24== My mother had a maid call’d Barbary;
==25== She was in love, and he she lov’d prov’d mad,
==26== And did forsake her. She had a song of “Willow,”
==27== An old thing ’twas, but it express’d her fortune,
==28== And she died singing it. That song tonight
==29== Will not go from my mind; I have much to do
==30== But to go hang my head all at one side
==31== And sing it like poor Barbary. Prithee dispatch.

**EMIL.**
==32== Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

**DES.**
==32==                   No, unpin me here.
==33== This Lodovico is a proper man.

**EMIL.**
==34== A very handsome man.

**DES.**
==35== He speaks well.

**EMIL.**
==36== I know a lady in Venice would have walk’d barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

**DES.**
*(Singing.)*
==37== *“The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,*
==38== *Sing all a green willow;*
==39== *Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,*
==40== *Sing willow, willow, willow.*
==41== *The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur’d her moans,*
==42== *Sing willow, willow, willow;*
==43== *Her salt tears fell from her, and soft’ned the stones,*
==44== *Sing willow”⁠—*
==45== Lay by these⁠—
*(Singing.)*
==46== *“— willow, willow”⁠—*
==47== Prithee hie thee; he’ll come anon⁠—
*(Singing.)*
==48== *“Sing all a green willow must be my garland.*
==49== *Let nobody blame him, his scorn I approve”⁠—*
==50== Nay, that’s not next. Hark, who is’t that knocks?

**EMIL.**
==51== It’s the wind.

**DES.**
*(Singing.)*
==52== *“I call’d my love false love; but what said he then?*
==53== *Sing willow, willow, willow;*
==54== *If I court more women, you’ll couch with more men.”⁠—*
==55== So get thee gone, good night. Mine eyes do itch;
==56== Doth that bode weeping?

**EMIL.**
==56==               ’Tis neither here nor there.

**DES.**
==57== I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
==58== Dost thou in conscience think—tell me, Emilia⁠—
==59== That there be women do abuse their husbands
==60== In such gross kind?

**EMIL.**
==60==            There be some such, no question.

**DES.**
==61== Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

**EMIL.**
==62== Why, would not you?

**DES.**
==62==            No, by this heavenly light!

**EMIL.**
==63== Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
==64== I might do’t as well i’ th’ dark.

**DES.**
==65== Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

**EMIL.**
==66== The world’s a huge thing; it is a great price
==67== For a small vice.

**DES.**
==68== Good troth, I think thou wouldst not.

**EMIL.**
==69== By my troth, I think I should, and undo’t when I had done’t. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty exhibition; but, for all the whole world—’ud’s pity, who would not make her husband a cuckold to make him a monarch? I should venture purgatory for’t.

**DES.**
==70== Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
==71== For the whole world.

**EMIL.**
==72== Why, the wrong is but a wrong i’ th’ world; and having the world for your labor, ’tis a wrong in your own world, and you might quickly make it right.

**DES.**
==73== I do not think there is any such woman.

**EMIL.**
==74== Yes, a dozen; and as many to th’ vantage as would store the world they play’d for.
==75== But I do think it is their husbands’ faults
==76== If wives do fall. Say that they slack their duties,
==77== And pour our treasures into foreign laps;
==78== Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
==79== Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
==80== Or scant our former having in despite:
==81== Why, we have galls; and though we have some grace,
==82== Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
==83== Their wives have sense like them; they see, and smell,
==84== And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
==85== As husbands have. What is it that they do
==86== When they change us for others? Is it sport?
==87== I think it is. And doth affection breed it?
==88== I think it doth. Is’t frailty that thus errs?
==89== It is so too. And have not we affections,
==90== Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
==91== Then let them use us well; else let them know,
==92== The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

**DES.**
==93== Good night, good night. God me such uses send,
==94== Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend.

*Exeunt.*
