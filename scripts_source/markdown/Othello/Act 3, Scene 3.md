## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Cyprus. The garden of the castle.*

*Enter Desdemona, Cassio, and Emilia.*

**DES.**
==1== Be thou assur’d, good Cassio, I will do
==2== All my abilities in thy behalf.

**EMIL.**
==3== Good madam, do. I warrant it grieves my husband
==4== As if the cause were his.

**DES.**
==5== O, that’s an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
==6== But I will have my lord and you again
==7== As friendly as you were.

**CAS.**
==7==               Bounteous madam,
==8== What ever shall become of Michael Cassio,
==9== He’s never any thing but your true servant.

**DES.**
==10== I know’t; I thank you. You do love my lord;
==11== You have known him long, and be you well assur’d
==12== He shall in strangeness stand no farther off
==13== Than in a politic distance.

**CAS.**
==13==               Ay, but, lady,
==14== That policy may either last so long,
==15== Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
==16== Or breed itself so out of circumstances,
==17== That I being absent and my place supplied,
==18== My general will forget my love and service.

**DES.**
==19== Do not doubt that; before Emilia here,
==20== I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,
==21== If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it
==22== To the last article. My lord shall never rest,
==23== I’ll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;
==24== His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift,
==25== I’ll intermingle every thing he does
==26== With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,
==27== For thy solicitor shall rather die
==28== Than give thy cause away.

*Enter Othello and Iago.*

**EMIL.**
==29== Madam, here comes my lord.

**CAS.**
==30== Madam, I’ll take my leave.

**DES.**
==31== Why, stay, and hear me speak.

**CAS.**
==32== Madam, not now; I am very ill at ease,
==33== Unfit for mine own purposes.

**DES.**
==34== Well, do your discretion.

*Exit Cassio.*

**IAGO.**
==35== Hah? I like not that.

**OTH.**
==35==               What dost thou say?

**IAGO.**
==36== Nothing, my lord; or if—I know not what.

**OTH.**
==37== Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

**IAGO.**
==38== Cassio, my lord? No, sure, I cannot think it,
==39== That he would steal away so guilty-like,
==40== Seeing your coming.

**OTH.**
==40==            I do believe ’twas he.

**DES.**
==41== How now, my lord?
==42== I have been talking with a suitor here,
==43== A man that languishes in your displeasure.

**OTH.**
==44== Who is’t you mean?

**DES.**
==45== Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
==46== If I have any grace or power to move you,
==47== His present reconciliation take;
==48== For if he be not one that truly loves you,
==49== That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
==50== I have no judgment in an honest face.
==51== I prithee call him back.

**OTH.**
==51==               Went he hence now?

**DES.**
==52== Yes, faith; so humbled
==53== That he hath left part of his grief with me
==54== To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

**OTH.**
==55== Not now, sweet Desdemon, some other time.

**DES.**
==56== But shall’t be shortly?

**OTH.**
==56==            The sooner, sweet, for you.

**DES.**
==57== Shall’t be tonight at supper?

**OTH.**
==57==                 No, not tonight.

**DES.**
==58== Tomorrow dinner then?

**OTH.**
==58==               I shall not dine at home;
==59== I meet the captains at the citadel.

**DES.**
==60== Why then tomorrow night, or Tuesday morn;
==61== On Tuesday noon, or night; on We’n’sday morn.
==62== I prithee name the time, but let it not
==63== Exceed three days. In faith, he’s penitent;
==64== And yet his trespass, in our common reason
==65== (Save that they say the wars must make example
==66== Out of her best), is not almost a fault
==67== T’ incur a private check. When shall he come?
==68== Tell me, Othello. I wonder in my soul
==69== What you would ask me that I should deny,
==70== Or stand so mamm’ring on. What? Michael Cassio,
==71== That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
==72== When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
==73== Hath ta’en your part—to have so much to do
==74== To bring him in! By’r lady, I could do much⁠—

**OTH.**
==75== Prithee no more; let him come when he will;
==76== I will deny thee nothing.

**DES.**
==76==               Why, this is not a boon;
==77== ’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
==78== Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
==79== Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
==80== To your own person. Nay, when I have a suit
==81== Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
==82== It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,
==83== And fearful to be granted.

**OTH.**
==83==               I will deny thee nothing;
==84== Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
==85== To leave me but a little to myself.

**DES.**
==86== Shall I deny you? No. Farewell, my lord.

**OTH.**
==87== Farewell, my Desdemona, I’ll come to thee straight.

**DES.**
==88== Emilia, come.—Be as your fancies teach you;
==89== What e’er you be, I am obedient.

*Exit with Emilia.*

**OTH.**
==90== Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul
==91== But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,
==92== Chaos is come again.

**IAGO.**
==93== My noble lord⁠—

**OTH.**
==93==            What dost thou say, Iago?

**IAGO.**
==94== Did Michael Cassio, when you woo’d my lady,
==95== Know of your love?

**OTH.**
==96== He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?

**IAGO.**
==97== But for a satisfaction of my thought,
==98== No further harm.

**OTH.**
==98==            Why of thy thought, Iago?

**IAGO.**
==99== I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

**OTH.**
==100== O yes, and went between us very oft.

**IAGO.**
==101== Indeed!

**OTH.**
==102== Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discern’st thou aught in that?
==103== Is he not honest?

**IAGO.**
==103==            Honest, my lord?

**OTH.**
==104== Honest? Ay, honest.

**IAGO.**
==104==               My lord, for aught I know.

**OTH.**
==105== What dost thou think?

**IAGO.**
==105==            Think, my lord?

**OTH.**
==106== Think, my lord? By heaven, thou echo’st me,
==107== As if there were some monster in thy thought
==108== Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.
==109== I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,
==110== When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?
==111== And when I told thee he was of my counsel
==112== In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, “Indeed!”
==113== And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
==114== As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
==115== Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me,
==116== Show me thy thought.

**IAGO.**
==117== My lord, you know I love you.

**OTH.**
==117==                   I think thou dost;
==118== And for I know thou’rt full of love and honesty,
==119== And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,
==120== Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;
==121== For such things in a false disloyal knave
==122== Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just
==123== They’re close dilations, working from the heart,
==124== That passion cannot rule.

**IAGO.**
==124==               For Michael Cassio,
==125== I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

**OTH.**
==126== I think so too.

**IAGO.**
==126==         Men should be what they seem,
==127== Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

**OTH.**
==128== Certain, men should be what they seem.

**IAGO.**
==129== Why then I think Cassio’s an honest man.

**OTH.**
==130== Nay, yet there’s more in this.
==131== I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings,
==132== As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
==133== The worst of words.

**IAGO.**
==133==            Good my lord, pardon me:
==134== Though I am bound to every act of duty,
==135== I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
==136== Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vild and false,
==137== As where’s that palace whereinto foul things
==138== Sometimes intrude not? Who has that breast so pure
==139== But some uncleanly apprehensions
==140== Keep leets and law-days and in sessions sit
==141== With meditations lawful?

**OTH.**
==142== Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
==143== If thou but think’st him wrong’d, and mak’st his ear
==144== A stranger to thy thoughts.

**IAGO.**
==144==               I do beseech you,
==145== Though I perchance am vicious in my guess
==146== (As I confess it is my nature’s plague
==147== To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
==148== Shapes faults that are not), that your wisdom then,
==149== From one that so imperfectly conjects,
==150== Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
==151== Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
==152== It were not for your quiet nor your good,
==153== Nor for my manhood, honesty, and wisdom,
==154== To let you know my thoughts.

**OTH.**
==155== ’Zounds, what dost thou mean?

**IAGO.**
==156== Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
==157== Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
==158== Who steals my purse steals trash; ’tis something, nothing;
==159== ’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
==160== But he that filches from me my good name
==161== Robs me of that which not enriches him,
==162== And makes me poor indeed.

**OTH.**
==163== By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.

**IAGO.**
==164== You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,
==165== Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.

**OTH.**
==166== Ha?

**IAGO.**
==166==     O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
==167== It is the green-ey’d monster which doth mock
==168== The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss
==169== Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
==170== But O, what damned minutes tells he o’er
==171== Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!

**OTH.**
==172== O misery!

**IAGO.**
==173== Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,
==174== But riches fineless is as poor as winter
==175== To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
==176== Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend
==177== From jealousy!

**OTH.**
==177==         Why? Why is this?
==178== Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy?
==179== To follow still the changes of the moon
==180== With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt
==181== Is once to be resolv’d. Exchange me for a goat,
==182== When I shall turn the business of my soul
==183== To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
==184== Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous
==185== To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
==186== Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;
==187== Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.
==188== Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
==189== The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,
==190== For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,
==191== I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
==192== And on the proof, there is no more but this⁠—
==193== Away at once with love or jealousy!

**IAGO.**
==194== I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason
==195== To show the love and duty that I bear you
==196== With franker spirit; therefore (as I am bound) 
==197== Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
==198== Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio,
==199== Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.
==200== I would not have your free and noble nature,
==201== Out of self-bounty, be abus’d; look to’t.
==202== I know our country disposition well:
==203== In Venice they do let God see the pranks
==204== They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
==205== Is not to leave’t undone, but keep’t unknown.

**OTH.**
==206== Dost thou say so?

**IAGO.**
==207== She did deceive her father, marrying you,
==208== And when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,
==209== She lov’d them most.

**OTH.**
==209==            And so she did.

**IAGO.**
==209==                      Why, go to then.
==210== She that so young could give out such a seeming
==211== To seel her father’s eyes up, close as oak,
==212== He thought ’twas witchcraft—but I am much to blame;
==213== I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
==214== For too much loving you.

**OTH.**
==214==            I am bound to thee forever.

**IAGO.**
==215== I see this hath a little dash’d your spirits.

**OTH.**
==216== Not a jot, not a jot.

**IAGO.**
==216==               I’ faith, I fear it has.
==217== I hope you will consider what is spoke
==218== Comes from my love. But I do see y’ are mov’d.
==219== I am to pray you not to strain my speech
==220== To grosser issues nor to larger reach
==221== Than to suspicion.

**OTH.**
==222== I will not.

**IAGO.**
==222==         Should you do so, my lord,
==223== My speech should fall into such vild success
==224== Which my thoughts aim’d not. Cassio’s my worthy friend⁠—
==225== My lord, I see y’ are mov’d.

**OTH.**
==225==               No, not much mov’d:
==226== I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.

**IAGO.**
==227== Long live she so! And long live you to think so!

**OTH.**
==228== And yet how nature erring from itself⁠—

**IAGO.**
==229== Ay, there’s the point; as (to be bold with you) 
==230== Not to affect many proposed matches
==231== Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
==232== Whereto we see in all things nature tends⁠—
==233== Foh, one may smell in such, a will most rank,
==234== Foul disproportions, thoughts unnatural.
==235== But (pardon me) I do not in position
==236== Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear
==237== Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
==238== May fall to match you with her country forms,
==239== And happily repent.

**OTH.**
==239==            Farewell, farewell!
==240== If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
==241== Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.

**IAGO.**
*(Going.)*
==242== My lord, I take my leave.

**OTH.**
==243== Why did I marry? This honest creature, doubtless,
==244== Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

**IAGO.**
*(Returning.)*
==245== My lord, I would I might entreat your honor
==246== To scan this thing no farther; leave it to time.
==247== Although ’tis fit that Cassio have his place⁠—
==248== For sure he fills it up with great ability⁠—
==249== Yet if you please to hold him off awhile,
==250== You shall by that perceive him and his means.
==251== Note if your lady strain his entertainment
==252== With any strong or vehement importunity;
==253== Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
==254== Let me be thought too busy in my fears
==255== (As worthy cause I have to fear I am) 
==256== And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.

**OTH.**
==257== Fear not my government.

**IAGO.**
==258== I once more take my leave.

*Exit.*

**OTH.**
==259== This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,
==260== And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
==261== Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
==262== Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings,
==263== I’ld whistle her off, and let her down the wind
==264== To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,
==265== And have not those soft parts of conversation
==266== That chamberers have, or for I am declin’d
==267== Into the vale of years (yet that’s not much),
==268== She’s gone. I am abus’d, and my relief
==269== Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage!
==270== That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
==271== And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad
==272== And live upon the vapor of a dungeon
==273== Than keep a corner in the thing I love
==274== For others’ uses. Yet ’tis the plague of great ones,
==275== Prerogativ’d are they less than the base;
==276== ’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death.
==277== Even then this forked plague is fated to us
==278== When we do quicken. Look where she comes:
*(Enter Desdemona and Emilia.)*
==279== If she be false, O then heaven mocks itself!
==280== I’ll not believe’t.

**DES.**
==280==         How now, my dear Othello?
==281== Your dinner, and the generous islanders
==282== By you invited, do attend your presence.

**OTH.**
==283== I am to blame.

**DES.**
==283==         Why do you speak so faintly?
==284== Are you not well?

**OTH.**
==285== I have a pain upon my forehead, here.

**DES.**
==286== Faith, that’s with watching, ’twill away again.
==287== Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
==288== It will be well.

**OTH.**
==288==         Your napkin is too little;
*(He puts the handkerchief from him, and it drops.)*
==289== Let it alone. Come, I’ll go in with you.

**DES.**
==290== I am very sorry that you are not well.

*Exit with Othello.*

**EMIL.**
==291== I am glad I have found this napkin;
==292== This was her first remembrance from the Moor.
==293== My wayward husband hath a hundred times
==294== Woo’d me to steal it; but she so loves the token
==295== (For he conjur’d her she should ever keep it) 
==296== That she reserves it evermore about her
==297== To kiss and talk to. I’ll have the work ta’en out,
==298== And give’t Iago. What he will do with it
==299== Heaven knows, not I;
==300== I nothing but to please his fantasy.

*Enter Iago.*

**IAGO.**
==301== How now? What do you here alone?

**EMIL.**
==302== Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

**IAGO.**
==303== You have a thing for me? It is a common thing⁠—

**EMIL.**
==304== Hah?

**IAGO.**
==305== To have a foolish wife.

**EMIL.**
==306== O, is that all? What will you give me now
==307== For that same handkerchief?

**IAGO.**
==307==                 What handkerchief?

**EMIL.**
==308== What handkerchief?
==309== Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona,
==310== That which so often you did bid me steal.

**IAGO.**
==311== Hast stol’n it from her?

**EMIL.**
==312== No, faith; she let it drop by negligence,
==313== And to th’ advantage, I, being here, took’t up.
==314== Look, here ’tis.

**IAGO.**
==314==         A good wench, give it me.

**EMIL.**
==315== What will you do with’t, that you have been so earnest
==316== To have me filch it?

**IAGO.**
*(Snatching it.)*
==316==            Why, what is that to you?

**EMIL.**
==317== If it be not for some purpose of import,
==318== Give’t me again. Poor lady, she’ll run mad
==319== When she shall lack it.

**IAGO.**
==320== Be not acknown on’t; I have use for it.
==321== Go, leave me.
*(Exit Emilia.)*
==322== I will in Cassio’s lodging lose this napkin,
==323== And let him find it. Trifles light as air
==324== Are to the jealous confirmations strong
==325== As proofs of holy writ; this may do something.
==326== The Moor already changes with my poison:
==327== Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons,
==328== Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
==329== But with a little act upon the blood
==330== Burn like the mines of sulphur.
*(Enter Othello.)*
==330==                   I did say so.
==331== Look where he comes! Not poppy, nor mandragora,
==332== Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world
==333== Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
==334== Which thou ow’dst yesterday.

**OTH.**
==334==                 Ha, ha, false to me?

**IAGO.**
==335== Why, how now, general? No more of that.

**OTH.**
==336== Avaunt, be gone! Thou hast set me on the rack.
==337== I swear ’tis better to be much abus’d
==338== Than but to know’t a little.

**IAGO.**
==338==                 How now, my lord?

**OTH.**
==339== What sense had I in her stol’n hours of lust?
==340== I saw’t not, thought it not; it harm’d not me.
==341== I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry;
==342== I found not Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
==343== He that is robb’d, not wanting what is stol’n,
==344== Let him not know’t, and he’s not robb’d at all.

**IAGO.**
==345== I am sorry to hear this.

**OTH.**
==346== I had been happy, if the general camp,
==347== Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
==348== So I had nothing known. O now, forever
==349== Farewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!
==350== Farewell the plumed troops and the big wars
==351== That makes ambition virtue! O, farewell!
==352== Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,
==353== The spirit-stirring drum, th’ ear-piercing fife,
==354== The royal banner, and all quality,
==355== Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
==356== And O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
==357== Th’ immortal Jove’s dread clamors counterfeit,
==358== Farewell! Othello’s occupation’s gone.

**IAGO.**
==359== Is’t possible, my lord?

**OTH.**
==360== Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore;
*(Taking him by the throat.)*
==361== Be sure of it. Give me the ocular proof,
==362== Or by the worth of mine eternal soul,
==363== Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
==364== Than answer my wak’d wrath!

**IAGO.**
==364==                 Is’t come to this?

**OTH.**
==365== Make me to see’t; or (at the least) so prove it
==366== That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
==367== To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

**IAGO.**
==368== My noble lord⁠—

**OTH.**
==369== If thou dost slander her and torture me,
==370== Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
==371== On horror’s head horrors accumulate;
==372== Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amaz’d;
==373== For nothing canst thou to damnation add
==374== Greater than that.

**IAGO.**
==374==            O grace! O heaven forgive me!
==375== Are you a man? Have you a soul? Or sense?
==376== God buy you; take mine office. O wretched fool,
==377== That lov’st to make thine honesty a vice!
==378== O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
==379== To be direct and honest is not safe.
==380== I thank you for this profit, and from hence
==381== I’ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offense.

**OTH.**
==382== Nay, stay. Thou shouldst be honest.

**IAGO.**
==383== I should be wise—for honesty’s a fool
==384== And loses that it works for.

**OTH.**
==384==               By the world,
==385== I think my wife be honest, and think she is not;
==386== I think that thou art just, and think thou art not.
==387== I’ll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
==388== As Dian’s visage, is now begrim’d and black
==389== As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
==390== Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
==391== I’ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

**IAGO.**
==392== I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion;
==393== I do repent me that I put it to you.
==394== You would be satisfied?

**OTH.**
==394==               Would? Nay, and I will.

**IAGO.**
==395== And may; but how? How satisfied, my lord?
==396== Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on?
==397== Behold her topp’d?

**OTH.**
==397==            Death and damnation! O!

**IAGO.**
==398== It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
==399== To bring them to that prospect; damn them then,
==400== If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
==401== More than their own. What then? How then?
==402== What shall I say? Where’s satisfaction?
==403== It is impossible you should see this,
==404== Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
==405== As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
==406== As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
==407== If imputation and strong circumstances
==408== Which lead directly to the door of truth
==409== Will give you satisfaction, you might have’t.

**OTH.**
==410== Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.

**IAGO.**
==411== I do not like the office;
==412== But sith I am ent’red in this cause so far
==413== (Prick’d to’t by foolish honesty and love),
==414== I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,
==415== And being troubled with a raging tooth,
==416== I could not sleep.
==417== There are a kind of men, so loose of soul,
==418== That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs;
==419== One of this kind is Cassio.
==420== In sleep I heard him say, “Sweet Desdemona,
==421== Let us be wary, let us hide our loves”;
==422== And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand;
==423== Cry, “O sweet creature!” then kiss me hard,
==424== As if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots
==425== That grew upon my lips; then laid his leg
==426== Over my thigh, and sigh’d, and kiss’d, and then
==427== Cried, “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!”

**OTH.**
==428== O monstrous! Monstrous!

**IAGO.**
==428==               Nay, this was but his dream.

**OTH.**
==429== But this denoted a foregone conclusion.

**IAGO.**
==430== ’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream,
==431== And this may help to thicken other proofs
==432== That do demonstrate thinly.

**OTH.**
==432==               I’ll tear her all to pieces.

**IAGO.**
==433== Nay, yet be wise; yet we see nothing done;
==434== She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
==435== Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
==436== Spotted with strawberries in your wive’s hand?

**OTH.**
==437== I gave her such a one; ’twas my first gift.

**IAGO.**
==438== I know not that; but such a handkerchief
==439== (I am sure it was your wive’s) did I today
==440== See Cassio wipe his beard with.

**OTH.**
==440==                   If it be that⁠—

**IAGO.**
==441== If it be that, or any that was hers,
==442== It speaks against her with the other proofs.

**OTH.**
==443== O that the slave had forty thousand lives!
==444== One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
==445== Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago,
==446== All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
==447== ’Tis gone.
==448== Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!
==449== Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
==450== To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
==451== For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!

**IAGO.**
==451==               Yet be content.

**OTH.**
==452== O blood, blood, blood!

**IAGO.**
==453== Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

**OTH.**
==454== Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,
==455== Whose icy current and compulsive course
==456== Nev’r feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
==457== To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
==458== Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
==459== Shall nev’r look back, nev’r ebb to humble love,
==460== Till that a capable and wide revenge
==461== Swallow them up.
*(He kneels.)*
==462== Now by yond marble heaven,
==463== In the due reverence of a sacred vow
==464== I here engage my words.

**IAGO.**
==464==               Do not rise yet.
*(Iago kneels.)*
==465== Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
==466== You elements that clip us round about,
==467== Witness that here Iago doth give up
==468== The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
==469== To wrong’d Othello’s service! Let him command,
==470== And to obey shall be in me remorse,
==471== What bloody business ever.

*They rise.*

**OTH.**
==471==                 I greet thy love,
==472== Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
==473== And will upon the instant put thee to’t:
==474== Within these three days let me hear thee say
==475== That Cassio’s not alive.

**IAGO.**
==476== My friend is dead; ’tis done at your request.
==477== But let her live.

**OTH.**
==478== Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her, damn her!
==479== Come go with me apart, I will withdraw
==480== To furnish me with some swift means of death
==481== For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

**IAGO.**
==482== I am your own forever.

*Exeunt.*
