## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Cyprus. A street.*

*Enter Iago and Roderigo.*

**IAGO.**
==1==Here, stand behind this bulk, straight will he come.
==2==Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home.
==3==Quick, quick, fear nothing; I’ll be at thy elbow.
==4==It makes us, or it mars us, think on that,
==5==And fix most firm thy resolution.

**ROD.**
==6==Be near at hand, I may miscarry in’t.

**IAGO.**
==7==Here, at thy hand; be bold, and take thy stand.

*Retires.*

**ROD.**
==8==I have no great devotion to the deed,
==9==And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons.
==10==’Tis but a man gone. Forth my sword; he dies.

**IAGO.**
==11==I have rubb’d this young quat almost to the sense,
==12==And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
==13==Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
==14==Every way makes my gain. Live Roderigo,
==15==He calls me to a restitution large
==16==Of gold and jewels that I bobb’d from him
==17==As gifts to Desdemona;
==18==It must not be. If Cassio do remain,
==19==He hath a daily beauty in his life
==20==That makes me ugly; and besides, the Moor
==21==May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril.
==22==No, he must die. Be’t so. I hear him coming.

*Enter Cassio.*

**ROD.**
==23==I know his gait, ’tis he.—Villain, thou diest!

*Makes a pass at Cassio.*

**CAS.**
==24==That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
==25==But that my coat is better than thou know’st.
==26==I will make proof of thine.

*Draws, and wounds Roderigo.*

**ROD.**
==26==                O, I am slain.

*Iago from behind wounds Cassio in the leg, and exit.*

**CAS.**
==27==I am maim’d forever. Help ho! Murder, murder!

*Falls.*

*Enter Othello.*

**OTH.**
==28==The voice of Cassio! Iago keeps his word.

**ROD.**
==29==O, villain that I am!

**OTH.**
==29==              It is even so.

**CAS.**
==30==O, help ho! Light! A surgeon!

**OTH.**
==31==’Tis he!—O brave Iago, honest and just,
==32==That hast such noble sense of thy friend’s wrong!
==33==Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
==34==And your unblest fate hies. Strumpet, I come.
==35==Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
==36==Thy bed, lust-stain’d, shall with lust’s blood be spotted.

*Exit Othello.*

*Enter Lodovico and Gratiano.*

**CAS.**
==37==What ho! No watch? No passage? Murder, murder!

**GRA.**
==38==’Tis some mischance, the voice is very direful.

**CAS.**
==39==O, help!

**LOD.**
==40==Hark!

**ROD.**
==41==O wretched villin!

**LOD.**
==42==Two or three groan. ’Tis heavy night;
==43==These may be counterfeits; let’s think’t unsafe
==44==To come in to the cry without more help.

**ROD.**
==45==Nobody come? Then shall I bleed to death.

*Enter Iago with a light.*

**LOD.**
==46==Hark!

**GRA.**
==47==Here’s one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.

**IAGO.**
==48==Who’s there? Whose noise is this that cries on murder?

**LOD.**
==49==We do not know.

**IAGO.**
==49==              Did not you hear a cry?

**CAS.**
==50==Here, here! For heaven sake help me!

**IAGO.**
==50==                What’s the matter?

**GRA.**
==51==This is Othello’s ancient, as I take it.

**LOD.**
==52==The same indeed, a very valiant fellow.

**IAGO.**
==53==What are you here that cry so grievously?

**CAS.**
==54==Iago? O, I am spoil’d, undone by villains!
==55==Give me some help.

**IAGO.**
==56==O me, lieutenant! What villains have done this?

**CAS.**
==57==I think that one of them is hereabout,
==58==And cannot make away.

**IAGO.**
==58==              O treacherous villains!
*(To Lodovico and Gratiano.)*
==59==What are you there?
==60==Come in, and give some help.

**ROD.**
==61==O, help me there!

**CAS.**
==62==That’s one of them.

**IAGO.**
==62==           O murd’rous slave! O villain!

*Stabs Roderigo.*

**ROD.**
==63==O damn’d Iago! O inhuman dog!

**IAGO.**
==64==Kill men i’ th’ dark?—Where be these bloody thieves?⁠—
==65==How silent is this town!—Ho, murder, murder!⁠—
==66==What may you be? Are you of good or evil?

**LOD.**
==67==As you shall prove us, praise us.

**IAGO.**
==68==*Signior* Lodovico?

**LOD.**
==69==He, sir.

**IAGO.**
==70==I cry you mercy. Here’s Cassio hurt by villains.

**GRA.**
==71==Cassio?

**IAGO.**
==72==How is’t, brother?

**CAS.**
==73==My leg is cut in two.

**IAGO.**
==73==              Marry, heaven forbid!
==74==Light, gentlemen! I’ll bind it with my shirt.

*Enter Bianca.*

**BIAN.**
==75==What is the matter ho? Who is’t that cried?

**IAGO.**
==76==Who is’t that cried?

**BIAN.**
==77==O my dear Cassio, my sweet Cassio!
==78==O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

**IAGO.**
==79==O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
==80==Who they should be that have thus mangled you?

**CAS.**
==81==No.

**GRA.**
==82==I am sorry to find you thus; I have been to seek you.

**IAGO.**
==83==Lend me a garter. So.—O for a chair
==84==To bear him easily hence!

**BIAN.**
==85==Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

**IAGO.**
==86==Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
==87==To be a party in this injury.⁠—
==88==Patience awhile, good Cassio.—Come, come;
==89==Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
==90==Alas, my friend and my dear countryman
==91==Roderigo! No—yes, sure—O heaven, Roderigo!

**GRA.**
==92==What, of Venice?

**IAGO.**
==93==Even he, sir; did you know him?

**GRA.**
==93==                     Know him? Ay.

**IAGO.**
==94==*Signior* Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon;
==95==These bloody accidents must excuse my manners
==96==That so neglected you.

**GRA.**
==96==              I am glad to see you.

**IAGO.**
==97==How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!

**GRA.**
==98==Roderigo!

**IAGO.**
==99==He, he,’tis he.
*(A chair brought in.)*
==99==           O, that’s well said: the chair.
==100==Some good man bear him carefully from hence,
==101==I’ll fetch the general’s surgeon.
*(To Bianca.)*
==102==For you, mistress,
==103==Save you your labor.—He that lies slain here, Cassio,
==104==Was my dear friend. What malice was between you?

**CAS.**
==105==None in the world; nor do I know the man.

**IAGO.**
*(To Bianca.)*
==106==What? Look you pale?—O, bear him out o’ th’ air.
*(Cassio and Roderigo are borne off.)*
==107==Stay you, good gentlemen.—Look you pale, mistress?⁠—
==108==Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?⁠—
==109==Nay, an’ you stare, we shall hear more anon.⁠—
==110==Behold her well; I pray you look upon her.
==111==Do you see, gentlemen? Nay, guiltiness will speak,
==112==Though tongues were out of use.

*Enter Emilia.*

**EMIL.**
==113==Alas, what is the matter? What is the matter, husband?

**IAGO.**
==114==Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
==115==By Roderigo and fellows that are scap’d.
==116==He’s almost slain, and Roderigo quite dead.

**EMIL.**
==117==Alas, good gentleman! Alas, good Cassio!

**IAGO.**
==118==This is the fruits of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
==119==Go know of Cassio where he supp’d tonight.
*(To Bianca.)*
==120==What, do you shake at that?

**BIAN.**
==121==He supp’d at my house, but I therefore shake not.

**IAGO.**
==122==O, did he so? I charge you go with me.

**EMIL.**
==123==O fie upon thee, strumpet!

**BIAN.**
==124==I am no strumpet, but of life as honest
==125==As you that thus abuse me.

**EMIL.**
==125==              As I? Fough, fie upon thee!

**IAGO.**
==126==Kind gentlemen, let’s go see poor Cassio dress’d.
==127==Come, mistress, you must tell ’s another tale.
==128==Emilia, run you to the citadel,
==129==And tell my lord and lady what hath happ’d.⁠—
==130==Will you go on afore?
*(Aside.)*
==130==              This is the night
==131==That either makes me, or foredoes me quite.

*Exeunt.*
