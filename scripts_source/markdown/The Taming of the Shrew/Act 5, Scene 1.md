## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Padua. Before Lucentio’s house.*

*Enter Biondello, Lucentio, and Bianca; Gremio is out before.*

**BION.**
==1==Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.

**LUC.**
==2==I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need thee at home, therefore leave us.

**BION.**
==3==Nay, faith, I’ll see the church a’ your back, and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.

*Exeunt Lucentio, Bianca, and Biondello.*

**GRE.**
==4==I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.

*Enter Petruchio, Kate, Vincentio, Grumio, with Attendants.*

**PETR.**
==5==Sir, here’s the door, this is Lucentio’s house.
==6==My father’s bears more toward the market-place;
==7==Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

**VIN.**
==8==You shall not choose but drink before you go.
==9==I think I shall command your welcome here;
==10==And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.

*Knock.*

**GRE.**
==11==They’re busy within, you were best knock louder.

*Pedant looks out of the window.*

**PED.**
==12==What’s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?

**VIN.**
==13==Is *Signior* Lucentio within, sir?

**PED.**
==14==He’s within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.

**VIN.**
==15==What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to make merry withal?

**PED.**
==16==Keep your hundred pounds to yourself, he shall need none so long as I live.

**PETR.**
==17==Nay, I told you your son was well belov’d in Padua. Do you hear, sir?—to leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell *Signior* Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.

**PED.**
==18==Thou liest, his father is come from Padua and here looking out at the window.

**VIN.**
==19==Art thou his father?

**PED.**
==20==Ay, sir, so his mother says, if I may believe her.

**PETR.**
*(To Vincentio.)*
==21==Why, how now, gentleman? Why, this is flat knavery, to take upon you another man’s name.

**PED.**
==22==Lay hands on the villain. I believe ’a means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.

*Enter Biondello.*

**BION.**
==23==I have seen them in the church together, God send ’em good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master Vincentio! Now we are undone and brought to nothing.

**VIN.**
*(Seeing Biondello.)*
==24==Come hither, crack-hemp.

**BION.**
==25==I hope I may choose, sir.

**VIN.**
==26==Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?

**BION.**
==27==Forgot you? No, sir. I could not forget you, for I never saw you before in all my life.

**VIN.**
==28==What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy master’s father, Vincentio?

**BION.**
==29==What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir—see where he looks out of the window.

**VIN.**
==30==Is’t so indeed?

*He beats Biondello.*

**BION.**
==31==Help, help, help! Here’s a madman will murder me.

*Exit.*

**PED.**
==32==Help, son! Help, *Signior* Baptista!

*Exit above.*

**PETR.**
==33==Prithee, Kate, let’s stand aside and see the end of this controversy.

*They retire.*

*Enter Pedant below with Servants, Baptista, Tranio as Lucentio.*

**TRA.**
==34==Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

**VIN.**
==35==What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a copatain hat! O, I am undone, I am undone! While I play the good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the university.

**TRA.**
==36==How now, what’s the matter?

**BAP.**
==37==What, is the man lunatic?

**TRA.**
==38==Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit; but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what ’cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.

**VIN.**
==39==Thy father! O villain, he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

**BAP.**
==40==You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray what do you think is his name?

**VIN.**
==41==His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.

**PED.**
==42==Away, away, mad ass, his name is Lucentio, and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, *Signior* Vincentio.

**VIN.**
==43==Lucentio! O, he hath murd’red his master! Lay hold on him, I charge you, in the Duke’s name. O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?

**TRA.**
==44==Call forth an officer.
*(Exit Servant, who returns with an Officer.)*
==45==Carry this mad knave to the jail. Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

**VIN.**
==46==Carry me to the jail?

**GRE.**
==47==Stay, officer, he shall not go to prison.

**BAP.**
==48==Talk not, *Signior* Gremio; I say he shall go to prison.

**GRE.**
==49==Take heed, *Signior* Baptista, lest you be cony-catch’d in this business. I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.

**PED.**
==50==Swear if thou dar’st.

**GRE.**
==51==Nay, I dare not swear it.

**TRA.**
==52==Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.

**GRE.**
==53==Yes, I know thee to be *Signior* Lucentio.

**BAP.**
==54==Away with the dotard, to the jail with him!

*Enter Biondello, Lucentio, and Bianca.*

**VIN.**
==55==Thus strangers may be hal’d and abus’d. O monstrous villain!

**BION.**
==56==O, we are spoil’d and—yonder he is. Deny him, forswear him, or else we are all undone.

*Exeunt Biondello, Tranio, and Pedant as fast as may be.*

**LUC.**
==57==Pardon, sweet father.

*Kneel.*

**LORD.**
==57==              Lives my sweet son?

**BIAN.**
==58==Pardon, dear father.

**BAP.**
==58==           How hast thou offended?
==59==Where is Lucentio?

**LUC.**
==59==           Here’s Lucentio,
==60==Right son to the right Vincentio,
==61==That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
==62==While counterfeit supposes blear’d thine eyne.

**GRE.**
==63==Here’s packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!

**VIN.**
==64==Where is that damned villain Tranio,
==65==That fac’d and braved me in this matter so?

**BAP.**
==66==Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

**BIAN.**
==67==Cambio is chang’d into Lucentio.

**LUC.**
==68==Love wrought these miracles. Bianca’s love
==69==Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
==70==While he did bear my countenance in the town,
==71==And happily I have arrived at the last
==72==Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
==73==What Tranio did, myself enforc’d him to;
==74==Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

**VIN.**
==75==I’ll slit the villain’s nose, that would have sent me to the jail.

**BAP.**
==76==But do you hear, sir? Have you married my daughter without asking my good will?

**VIN.**
==77==Fear not, Baptista, we will content you, go to; but I will in to be reveng’d for this villainy.

*Exit.*

**BAP.**
==78==And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

*Exit.*

**LUC.**
==79==Look not pale, Bianca, thy father will not frown.

*Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.*

**GRE.**
==80==My cake is dough, but I’ll in among the rest,
==81==Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.

*Exit.*

**KATH.**
==82==Husband, let’s follow, to see the end of this ado.

**PETR.**
==83==First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

**KATH.**
==84==What, in the midst of the street?

**PETR.**
==85==What, art thou asham’d of me?

**KATH.**
==86==No, sir, God forbid, but asham’d to kiss.

**PETR.**
==87==Why then let’s home again. Come, sirrah, let’s away.

**KATH.**
==88==Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love, stay.

**PETR.**
==89==Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
==90==Better once than never, for never too late.

*Exeunt.*
