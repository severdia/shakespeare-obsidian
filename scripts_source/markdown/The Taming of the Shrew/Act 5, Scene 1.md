## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Padua. Before Lucentio’s house.*

*Enter Biondello, Lucentio, and Bianca; Gremio is out before.*

**BION.**
Softly and swiftly, sir, for the priest is ready.

**LUC.**
I fly, Biondello; but they may chance to need thee at home, therefore leave us.

**BION.**
Nay, faith, I’ll see the church a’ your back, and then come back to my master’s as soon as I can.

*Exeunt Lucentio, Bianca, and Biondello.*

**GRE.**
I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.

*Enter Petruchio, Kate, Vincentio, Grumio, with Attendants.*

**PETR.**
Sir, here’s the door, this is Lucentio’s house.
My father’s bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

**VIN.**
You shall not choose but drink before you go.
I think I shall command your welcome here;
And by all likelihood some cheer is toward.

*Knock.*

**GRE.**
They’re busy within, you were best knock louder.

*Pedant looks out of the window.*

**PED.**
What’s he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?

**VIN.**
Is *Signior* Lucentio within, sir?

**PED.**
He’s within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.

**VIN.**
What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to make merry withal?

**PED.**
Keep your hundred pounds to yourself, he shall need none so long as I live.

**PETR.**
Nay, I told you your son was well belov’d in Padua. Do you hear, sir?—to leave frivolous circumstances, I pray you tell *Signior* Lucentio that his father is come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.

**PED.**
Thou liest, his father is come from Padua and here looking out at the window.

**VIN.**
Art thou his father?

**PED.**
Ay, sir, so his mother says, if I may believe her.

**PETR.**
*(To Vincentio.)*
Why, how now, gentleman? Why, this is flat knavery, to take upon you another man’s name.

**PED.**
Lay hands on the villain. I believe ’a means to cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.

*Enter Biondello.*

**BION.**
I have seen them in the church together, God send ’em good shipping! But who is here? Mine old master Vincentio! Now we are undone and brought to nothing.

**VIN.**
*(Seeing Biondello.)*
Come hither, crack-hemp.

**BION.**
I hope I may choose, sir.

**VIN.**
Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?

**BION.**
Forgot you? No, sir. I could not forget you, for I never saw you before in all my life.

**VIN.**
What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see thy master’s father, Vincentio?

**BION.**
What, my old worshipful old master? Yes, marry, sir—see where he looks out of the window.

**VIN.**
Is’t so indeed?

*He beats Biondello.*

**BION.**
Help, help, help! Here’s a madman will murder me.

*Exit.*

**PED.**
Help, son! Help, *Signior* Baptista!

*Exit above.*

**PETR.**
Prithee, Kate, let’s stand aside and see the end of this controversy.

*They retire.*

*Enter Pedant below with Servants, Baptista, Tranio as Lucentio.*

**TRA.**
Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

**VIN.**
What am I, sir? Nay, what are you, sir? O immortal gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet, a velvet hose, a scarlet cloak, and a copatain hat! O, I am undone, I am undone! While I play the good husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at the university.

**TRA.**
How now, what’s the matter?

**BAP.**
What, is the man lunatic?

**TRA.**
Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your habit; but your words show you a madman. Why, sir, what ’cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.

**VIN.**
Thy father! O villain, he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

**BAP.**
You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray what do you think is his name?

**VIN.**
His name! As if I knew not his name! I have brought him up ever since he was three years old, and his name is Tranio.

**PED.**
Away, away, mad ass, his name is Lucentio, and he is mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, *Signior* Vincentio.

**VIN.**
Lucentio! O, he hath murd’red his master! Lay hold on him, I charge you, in the Duke’s name. O, my son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?

**TRA.**
Call forth an officer.
*(Exit Servant, who returns with an Officer.)*
Carry this mad knave to the jail. Father Baptista, I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

**VIN.**
Carry me to the jail?

**GRE.**
Stay, officer, he shall not go to prison.

**BAP.**
Talk not, *Signior* Gremio; I say he shall go to prison.

**GRE.**
Take heed, *Signior* Baptista, lest you be cony-catch’d in this business. I dare swear this is the right Vincentio.

**PED.**
Swear if thou dar’st.

**GRE.**
Nay, I dare not swear it.

**TRA.**
Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.

**GRE.**
Yes, I know thee to be *Signior* Lucentio.

**BAP.**
Away with the dotard, to the jail with him!

*Enter Biondello, Lucentio, and Bianca.*

**VIN.**
Thus strangers may be hal’d and abus’d. O monstrous villain!

**BION.**
O, we are spoil’d and—yonder he is. Deny him, forswear him, or else we are all undone.

*Exeunt Biondello, Tranio, and Pedant as fast as may be.*

**LUC.**
Pardon, sweet father.

*Kneel.*

**LORD.**
              Lives my sweet son?

**BIAN.**
Pardon, dear father.

**BAP.**
           How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?

**LUC.**
           Here’s Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio,
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes blear’d thine eyne.

**GRE.**
Here’s packing, with a witness, to deceive us all!

**VIN.**
Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That fac’d and braved me in this matter so?

**BAP.**
Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

**BIAN.**
Cambio is chang’d into Lucentio.

**LUC.**
Love wrought these miracles. Bianca’s love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town,
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforc’d him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

**VIN.**
I’ll slit the villain’s nose, that would have sent me to the jail.

**BAP.**
But do you hear, sir? Have you married my daughter without asking my good will?

**VIN.**
Fear not, Baptista, we will content you, go to; but I will in to be reveng’d for this villainy.

*Exit.*

**BAP.**
And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

*Exit.*

**LUC.**
Look not pale, Bianca, thy father will not frown.

*Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.*

**GRE.**
My cake is dough, but I’ll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all but my share of the feast.

*Exit.*

**KATH.**
Husband, let’s follow, to see the end of this ado.

**PETR.**
First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

**KATH.**
What, in the midst of the street?

**PETR.**
What, art thou asham’d of me?

**KATH.**
No, sir, God forbid, but asham’d to kiss.

**PETR.**
Why then let’s home again. Come, sirrah, let’s away.

**KATH.**
Nay, I will give thee a kiss; now pray thee, love, stay.

**PETR.**
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.

*Exeunt.*
