## Act 1, Prologue 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Prologue 2|Act 1, Prologue 2 →]]

*Before an alehouse on a heath.*


*Enter beggar, Christopher Sly, and Hostess.*

**SLY.**
==1==I’ll pheeze you, in faith.

**HOST.**
==2==A pair of stocks, you rogue!

**SLY.**
==3==Y’ are a baggage, the Slys are no rogues. Look in the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror. Therefore *paucas pallabris*, let the world slide. Sessa!

**HOST.**
==4==You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?

**SLY.**
==5==No, not a denier. Go by, Saint Jeronimy! Go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

**HOST.**
==6==I know my remedy; I must go fetch the thirdborough.


*Exit.*

**SLY.**
==7==Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I’ll answer him by law. I’ll not budge an inch, boy; let him come, and kindly.


*Falls asleep.*


*Wind horns. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his Train.*

**LORD.**
==8==Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds
==9==(Brach Merriman, the poor cur, is emboss’d),
==10==And couple Clowder with the deep-mouth’d brach.
==11==Saw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
==12==At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
==13==I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

**1. HUN.**
==14==Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
==15==He cried upon it at the merest loss,
==16==And twice today pick’d out the dullest scent.
==17==Trust me, I take him for the better dog.

**LORD.**
==18==Thou art a fool; if Echo were as fleet,
==19==I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
==20==But sup them well, and look unto them all,
==21==Tomorrow I intend to hunt again.

**1. HUN.**
==22==I will, my lord.

**LORD.**
==23==What’s here? One dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?

**2. HUN.**
==24==He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm’d with ale,
==25==This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.

**LORD.**
==26==O monstrous beast, how like a swine he lies!
==27==Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
==28==Sirs, I will practice on this drunken man.
==29==What think you, if he were convey’d to bed,
==30==Wrapp’d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
==31==A most delicious banquet by his bed,
==32==And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
==33==Would not the beggar then forget himself?

**1. HUN.**
==34==Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.

**2. HUN.**
==35==It would seem strange unto him when he wak’d.

**LORD.**
==36==Even as a flatt’ring dream or worthless fancy.
==37==Then take him up, and manage well the jest.
==38==Carry him gently to my fairest chamber,
==39==And hang it round with all my wanton pictures.
==40==Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,
==41==And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet.
==42==Procure me music ready when he wakes,
==43==To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
==44==And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,
==45==And with a low submissive reverence
==46==Say, “What is it your honor will command?”
==47==Let one attend him with a silver basin
==48==Full of rose-water and bestrew’d with flowers,
==49==Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
==50==And say, “Will’t please your lordship cool your hands?”
==51==Some one be ready with a costly suit,
==52==And ask him what apparel he will wear;
==53==Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
==54==And that his lady mourns at his disease.
==55==Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,
==56==And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
==57==For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
==58==This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;
==59==It will be pastime passing excellent,
==60==If it be husbanded with modesty.

**1. HUN.**
==61==My lord, I warrant you we will play our part
==62==As he shall think by our truediligence
==63==He is no less than what we say he is.

**LORD.**
==64==Take him up gently and to bed with him,
==65==And each one to his office when he wakes.
*(Some bear out Sly.)*
*(Sound trumpets.)*
==66==Sirrah, go see what trumpet ’tis that sounds.
*(Exit Servingman.)*
==67==Belike some noble gentleman that means
==68==(Traveling some journey) to repose him here.
*(Enter Servingman.)*
==69==How now? Who is it?

**1. SERV.**
==70==An’t please your honor, players
==71==That offer service to your lordship.


*Enter Players.*

**LORD.**
==72==Bid them come near. Now, fellows, you are welcome.

**ALL PLAYERS.**
==73==We thank your honor.

**LORD.**
==74==Do you intend to stay with me tonight?

**2. PLAY.**
==75==So please your lordship to accept our duty.

**LORD.**
==76==With all my heart. This fellow I remember
==77==Since once he play’d a farmer’s eldest son.
==78==’Twas where you woo’d the gentlewoman so well.
==79==I have forgot your name; but sure that part
==80==Was aptly fitted and naturally perform’d.

**1. PLAY.**
==81==I think ’twas Soto that your honor means.

**LORD.**
==82==’Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.
==83==Well, you are come to me in happy time,
==84==The rather for I have some sport in hand,
==85==Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
==86==There is a lord will hear you play tonight;
==87==But I am doubtful of your modesties,
==88==Lest, over-eyeing of his odd behavior
==89==(For yet his honor never heard a play),
==90==You break into some merry passion,
==91==And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
==92==If you should smile, he grows impatient.

**1. PLAY.**
==93==Fear not, my lord, we can contain ourselves,
==94==Were he the veriest antic in the world.

**LORD.**
==95==Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
==96==And give them friendly welcome every one.
==97==Let them want nothing that my house affords.
*(Exit one with the Players.)*
==98==Sirrah, go you to Barthol’mew my page,
==99==And see him dress’d in all suits like a lady;
==100==That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber,
==101==And call him madam, do him obeisance.
==102==Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
==103==He bear himself with honorable action,
==104==Such as he hath observ’d in noble ladies
==105==Unto their lords, by them accomplished;
==106==Such duty to the drunkard let him do,
==107==With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
==108==And say, “What is’t your honor will command,
==109==Wherein your lady, and your humble wife,
==110==May show her duty and make known her love?”
==111==And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
==112==And with declining head into his bosom,
==113==Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed
==114==To see her noble lord restor’d to health,
==115==Who for this seven years hath esteemed him
==116==No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.
==117==And if the boy have not a woman’s gift
==118==To rain a shower of commanded tears,
==119==An onion will do well for such a shift,
==120==Which in a napkin (being close convey’d) 
==121==Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
==122==See this dispatch’d with all the haste thou canst;
==123==Anon I’ll give thee more instructions.
*(Exit First Servingman.)*
==124==I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
==125==Voice, gait, and action of a gentlewoman.
==126==I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
==127==And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
==128==When they do homage to this simple peasant.
==129==I’ll in to counsel them; haply my presence
==130==May well abate the over-merry spleen,
==131==Which otherwise would grow into extremes.


*Exeunt.*
