## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Padua. Before Baptista’s house.*

*Enter Tranio as Lucentio and Hortensio as Litio.*

**TRA.**
==1==Is’t possible, friend Litio, that Mistress Bianca
==2==Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
==3==I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

**HOR.**
==4==Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
==5==Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.

*They stand aside.*

*Enter Bianca and Lucentio as Cambio.*

**LUC.**
==6==Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?

**BIAN.**
==7==What, master, read you? First resolve me that.

**LUC.**
==8==I read that I profess, the Art to Love.

**BIAN.**
==9==And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

**LUC.**
==10==While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!

*They retire.*

**HOR.**
==11==Quick proceeders, marry! Now tell me, I pray,
==12==You that durst swear that your mistress Bianca
==13==Lov’d none in the world so well as Lucentio.

**TRA.**
==14==O despiteful love, unconstant womankind!
==15==I tell thee, Litio, this is wonderful.

**HOR.**
==16==Mistake no more, I am not Litio,
==17==Nor a musician, as I seem to be,
==18==But one that scorn to live in this disguise
==19==For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
==20==And makes a god of such a cullion.
==21==Know, sir, that I am call’d Hortensio.

**TRA.**
==22==*Signior* Hortensio, I have often heard
==23==Of your entire affection to Bianca,
==24==And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
==25==I will with you, if you be so contented,
==26==Forswear Bianca and her love forever.

**HOR.**
==27==See how they kiss and court! *Signior* Lucentio,
==28==Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
==29==Never to woo her more, but do forswear her
==30==As one unworthy all the former favors
==31==That I have fondly flatter’d her withal.

**TRA.**
==32==And here I take the like unfeigned oath,
==33==Never to marry with her though she would entreat.
==34==Fie on her, see how beastly she doth court him!

**HOR.**
==35==Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
==36==For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
==37==I will be married to a wealthy widow,
==38==Ere three days pass, which hath as long lov’d me
==39==As I have lov’d this proud disdainful haggard.
==40==And so farewell, *Signior* Lucentio.
==41==Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
==42==Shall win my love, and so I take my leave,
==43==In resolution as I swore before.

*Exit.*

**TRA.**
==44==Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
==45==As ’longeth to a lover’s blessed case!
==46==Nay, I have ta’en you napping, gentle love,
==47==And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

**BIAN.**
==48==Tranio, you jest, but have you both forsworn me?

**TRA.**
==49==Mistress, we have.

**LUC.**
==49==           Then we are rid of Litio.

**TRA.**
==50==I’faith, he’ll have a lusty widow now,
==51==That shall be woo’d and wedded in a day.

**BIAN.**
==52==God give him joy!

**TRA.**
==53==Ay, and he’ll tame her.

**BIAN.**
==53==              He says so, Tranio?

**TRA.**
==54==Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

**BIAN.**
==55==The taming-school! What, is there such a place?

**TRA.**
==56==Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master,
==57==That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
==58==To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

*Enter Biondello.*

**BION.**
==59==O master, master, I have watch’d so long
==60==That I am dog-weary, but at last I spied
==61==An ancient angel coming down the hill,
==62==Will serve the turn.

**TRA.**
==63==What is he, Biondello?

**BION.**
==64==Master, a marcantant, or a pedant,
==65==I know not what, but formal in apparel,
==66==In gait and countenance surely like a father.

**LUC.**
==67==And what of him, Tranio?

**TRA.**
==68==If he be credulous, and trust my tale,
==69==I’ll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
==70==And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
==71==As if he were the right Vincentio.
==72==Take in your love, and then let me alone.

*Exeunt Lucentio and Bianca.*

*Enter a Pedant.*

**PED.**
==73==God save you, sir!

**TRA.**
==73==           And you, sir! You are welcome.
==74==Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

**PED.**
==75==Sir, at the farthest for a week or two,
==76==But then up farther, and as far as Rome,
==77==And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

**TRA.**
==78==What countryman, I pray?

**PED.**
==78==              Of Mantua.

**TRA.**
==79==Of Mantua, sir? Marry, God forbid!
==80==And come to Padua, careless of your life?

**PED.**
==81==My life, sir? How, I pray? For that goes hard.

**TRA.**
==82==’Tis death for any one in Mantua
==83==To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
==84==Your ships are stay’d at Venice, and the Duke,
==85==For private quarrel ’twixt your Duke and him,
==86==Hath publish’d and proclaim’d it openly.
==87==’Tis marvel, but that you are but newly come,
==88==You might have heard it else proclaim’d about.

**PED.**
==89==Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so,
==90==For I have bills for money by exchange
==91==From Florence, and must here deliver them.

**TRA.**
==92==Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
==93==This will I do, and this I will advise you.
==94==First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

**PED.**
==95==Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
==96==Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

**TRA.**
==97==Among them know you one Vincentio?

**PED.**
==98==I know him not, but I have heard of him;
==99==A merchant of incomparable wealth.

**TRA.**
==100==He is my father, sir, and sooth to say,
==101==In count’nance somewhat doth resemble you.

**BION.**
*(Aside.)*
==102==As much as an apple doth an oyster, and all one.

**TRA.**
==103==To save your life in this extremity,
==104==This favor will I do you for his sake;
==105==And think it not the worst of all your fortunes
==106==That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
==107==His name and credit shall you undertake,
==108==And in my house you shall be friendly lodg’d.
==109==Look that you take upon you as you should;
==110==You understand me, sir? So shall you stay
==111==Till you have done your business in the city.
==112==If this be court’sy, sir, accept of it.

**PED.**
==113==O sir, I do, and will repute you ever
==114==The patron of my life and liberty.

**TRA.**
==115==Then go with me to make the matter good.
==116==This by the way I let you understand:
==117==My father is here look’d for every day,
==118==To pass assurance of a dow’r in marriage
==119==’Twixt me and one Baptista’s daughter here.
==120==In all these circumstances I’ll instruct you;
==121==Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

*Exeunt.*
