## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*A room in Petruchio’s house.*

*Enter Katherina and Grumio.*

**GRU.**
==1== No, no, forsooth I dare not for my life.

**KATH.**
==2== The more my wrong, the more his spite appears.
==3== What, did he marry me to famish me?
==4== Beggars that come unto my father’s door
==5== Upon entreaty have a present alms,
==6== If not, elsewhere they meet with charity;
==7== But I, who never knew how to entreat,
==8== Nor never needed that I should entreat,
==9== Am starv’d for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
==10== With oaths kept waking, and with brawling fed;
==11== And that which spites me more than all these wants,
==12== He does it under name of perfect love;
==13== As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
==14== ’Twere deadly sickness, or else present death.
==15== I prithee go, and get me some repast;
==16== I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

**GRU.**
==17== What say you to a neat’s foot?

**KATH.**
==18== ’Tis passing good, I prithee let me have it.

**GRU.**
==19== I fear it is too choleric a meat.
==20== How say you to a fat tripe finely broil’d?

**KATH.**
==21== I like it well, good Grumio, fetch it me.

**GRU.**
==22== I cannot tell, I fear ’tis choleric.
==23== What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

**KATH.**
==24== A dish that I do love to feed upon.

**GRU.**
==25== Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

**KATH.**
==26== Why then the beef, and let the mustard rest.

**GRU.**
==27== Nay then I will not, you shall have the mustard,
==28== Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

**KATH.**
==29== Then both or one, or any thing thou wilt.

**GRU.**
==30== Why then the mustard without the beef.

**KATH.**
==31== Go get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
*(Beats him.)*
==32== That feed’st me with the very name of meat.
==33== Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
==34== That triumph thus upon my misery!
==35== Go get thee gone, I say.

*Enter Petruchio and Hortensio with meat.*

**PETR.**
==36== How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

**HOR.**
==37== Mistress, what cheer?

**KATH.**
==37==            Faith, as cold as can be.

**PETR.**
==38== Pluck up thy spirits, look cheerfully upon me.
==39== Here, love, thou seest how diligent I am
==40== To dress thy meat myself, and bring it thee.
==41== I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
==42== What, not a word? Nay then, thou lov’st it not;
==43== And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
==44== Here, take away this dish.

**KATH.**
==44==               I pray you let it stand.

**PETR.**
==45== The poorest service is repaid with thanks,
==46== And so shall mine before you touch the meat.

**KATH.**
==47== I thank you, sir.

**HOR.**
==48== *Signior* Petruchio, fie, you are to blame.
==49== Come, Mistress Kate, I’ll bear you company.

**PETR.**
*(Aside.)*
==50== Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.⁠—
==51== Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
==52== Kate, eat apace. And now, my honey love,
==53== Will we return unto thy father’s house,
==54== And revel it as bravely as the best,
==55== With silken coats and caps, and golden rings,
==56== With ruffs and cuffs, and fardingales, and things,
==57== With scarfs and fans, and double change of brav’ry,
==58== With amber bracelets, beads, and all this knav’ry.
==59== What, hast thou din’d? The tailor stays thy leisure,
==60== To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
*(Enter Tailor.)*
==61== Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
==62== Lay forth the gown.
*(Enter Haberdasher.)*
==62==            What news with you, sir?

**HAB.**
==63== Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

**PETR.**
==64== Why, this was moulded on a porringer⁠—
==65== A velvet dish. Fie, fie, ’tis lewd and filthy.
==66== Why, ’tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
==67== A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby’s cap.
==68== Away with it! Come let me have a bigger.

**KATH.**
==69== I’ll have no bigger, this doth fit the time,
==70== And gentlewomen wear such caps as these.

**PETR.**
==71== When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
==72== And not till then.

**HOR.**
*(Aside.)*
==73== That will not be in haste.

**KATH.**
==74== Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,
==75== And speak I will. I am no child, no babe;
==76== Your betters have endur’d me say my mind,
==77== And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
==78== My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
==79== Or else my heart concealing it will break,
==80== And rather than it shall, I will be free,
==81== Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

**PETR.**
==82== Why, thou say’st true, it is a paltry cap,
==83== A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie.
==84== I love thee well in that thou lik’st it not.

**KATH.**
==85== Love me, or love me not, I like the cap,
==86== And it I will have, or I will have none.

*Exit Haberdasher.*

**PETR.**
==87== Thy gown? Why, ay. Come, tailor, let us see’t.
==88== O mercy, God, what masquing stuff is here?
==89== What’s this? A sleeve? ’Tis like a demi-cannon.
==90== What, up and down carv’d like an apple-tart?
==91== Here’s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
==92== Like to a censer in a barber’s shop.
==93== Why, what a’ devil’s name, tailor, call’st thou this?

**HOR.**
*(Aside.)*
==94== I see she’s like to have neither cap nor gown.

**TAI.**
==95== You bid me make it orderly and well,
==96== According to the fashion and the time.

**PETR.**
==97== Marry, and did; but if you be rememb’red,
==98== I did not bid you mar it to the time.
==99== Go hop me over every kennel home,
==100== For you shall hop without my custom, sir.
==101== I’ll none of it; hence, make your best of it.

**KATH.**
==102== I never saw a better fashion’d gown,
==103== More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable.
==104== Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

**PETR.**
==105== Why, true, he means to make a puppet of thee.

**TAI.**
==106== She says your worship means to make a puppet of her.

**PETR.**
==107== O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble,
==108== Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
==109== Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
==110== Brav’d in mine own house with a skein of thread?
==111== Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant,
==112== Or I shall so bemete thee with thy yard
==113== As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou liv’st!
==114== I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr’d her gown.

**TAI.**
==115== Your worship is deceiv’d, the gown is made
==116== Just as my master had direction.
==117== Grumio gave order how it should be done.

**GRU.**
==118== I gave him no order, I gave him the stuff.

**TAI.**
==119== But how did you desire it should be made?

**GRU.**
==120== Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

**TAI.**
==121== But did you not request to have it cut?

**GRU.**
==122== Thou hast fac’d many things.

**TAI.**
==123== I have.

**GRU.**
==124== Face not me; thou hast brav’d many men, brave not me; I will neither be fac’d nor brav’d. I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown, but I did not bid him cut it to pieces. *Ergo*, thou liest.

**TAI.**
==125== Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify.

**PETR.**
==126== Read it.

**GRU.**
==127== The note lies in ’s throat if he say I said so.

**TAI.**
*(Reads.)*
==128== *“Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown”—*

**GRU.**
==129== Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom of brown thread. I said a gown.

**PETR.**
==130== Proceed.

**TAI.**
*(Reads.)*
==131== *“With a small compass’d cape”—*

**GRU.**
==132== I confess the cape.

**TAI.**
*(Reads.)*
==133== *“With a trunk sleeve”—*

**GRU.**
==134== I confess two sleeves.

**TAI.**
*(Reads.)*
==135== *“The sleeves curiously cut.”*

**PETR.**
==136== Ay, there’s the villainy.

**GRU.**
==137== Error i’ th’ bill, sir, error i’ th’ bill! I commanded the sleeves should be cut out, and sew’d up again, and that I’ll prove upon thee, though thy little finger be arm’d in a thimble.

**TAI.**
==138== This is true that I say; and I had thee in place where, thou shouldst know it.

**GRU.**
==139== I am for thee straight. Take thou the bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.

**HOR.**
==140== God-a-mercy, Grumio, then he shall have no odds.

**PETR.**
==141== Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

**GRU.**
==142== You are i’ th’ right, sir, ’tis for my mistress.

**PETR.**
==143== Go take it up unto thy master’s use.

**GRU.**
==144== Villain, not for thy life! Take up my mistress’ gown for thy master’s use!

**PETR.**
==145== Why, sir, what’s your conceit in that?

**GRU.**
==146== O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
==147== Take up my mistress’ gown to his master’s use!
==148== O fie, fie, fie!

**PETR.**
*(Aside.)*
==149== Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.⁠—
==150== Go take it hence, be gone, and say no more.

**HOR.**
==151== Tailor, I’ll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow,
==152== Take no unkindness of his hasty words
==153== Away, I say, commend me to thy master.

*Exit Tailor.*

**PETR.**
==154== Well, come, my Kate, we will unto your father’s
==155== Even in these honest mean habiliments;
==156== Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor,
==157== For ’tis the mind that makes the body rich;
==158== And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
==159== So honor peereth in the meanest habit.
==160== What, is the jay more precious than the lark,
==161== Because his feathers are more beautiful?
==162== Or is the adder better than the eel,
==163== Because his painted skin contents the eye?
==164== O no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
==165== For this poor furniture and mean array.
==166== If thou accountedst it shame, lay it on me,
==167== And therefore frolic, we will hence forthwith,
==168== To feast and sport us at thy father’s house.
==169== Go call my men, and let us straight to him,
==170== And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
==171== There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
==172== Let’s see, I think ’tis now some seven a’ clock,
==173== And well we may come there by dinner-time.

**KATH.**
==174== I dare assure you, sir, ’tis almost two,
==175== And ’twill be supper-time ere you come there.

**PETR.**
==176== It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
==177== Look what I speak, or do, or think to do,
==178== You are still crossing it. Sirs, let’t alone,
==179== I will not go today, and ere I do,
==180== It shall be what a’ clock I say it is.

**HOR.**
*(Aside.)*
==181== Why, so this gallant will command the sun.

*Exeunt.*
