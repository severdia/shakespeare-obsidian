## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]]

*Padua. Lucentio’s house.*

*Enter Baptista, Vincentio, Gremio, the Pedant, Lucentio, and Bianca; Petruchio, Katherina, Hortensio, Tranio, Biondello, Grumio, and Widow: the servingmen with Tranio bringing in a banquet.*

**LUC.**
==1==At last, though long, our jarring notes agree,
==2==And time it is, when raging war is done,
==3==To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
==4==My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
==5==While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
==6==Brother Petruchio, sister Katherina,
==7==And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
==8==Feast with the best, and welcome to my house.
==9==My banquet is to close our stomachs up
==10==After our great good cheer. Pray you sit down,
==11==For now we sit to chat as well as eat.

**PETR.**
==12==Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

**BAP.**
==13==Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

**PETR.**
==14==Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

**HOR.**
==15==For both our sakes, I would that word were true.

**PETR.**
==16==Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

**WID.**
==17==Then never trust me if I be afeard.

**PETR.**
==18==You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
==19==I mean Hortensio is afeard of you.

**WID.**
==20==He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.

**PETR.**
==21==Roundly replied.

**KATH.**
==21==        Mistress, how mean you that?

**WID.**
==22==Thus I conceive by him.

**PETR.**
==23==Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?

**HOR.**
==24==My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.

**PETR.**
==25==Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

**KATH.**
==26==“He that is giddy thinks the world turns round”:
==27==I pray you tell me what you meant by that.

**WID.**
==28==Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
==29==Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe:
==30==And now you know my meaning.

**KATH.**
==31==A very mean meaning.

**WID.**
==31==           Right, I mean you.

**KATH.**
==32==And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

**PETR.**
==33==To her, Kate!

**HOR.**
==34==To her, widow!

**PETR.**
==35==A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

**HOR.**
==36==That’s my office.

**PETR.**
==37==Spoke like an officer. Ha’ to thee, lad!

*Drinks to Hortensio.*

**BAP.**
==38==How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

**GRE.**
==39==Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

**BIAN.**
==40==Head, and butt! An hasty-witted body
==41==Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

**VIN.**
==42==Ay, mistress bride, hath that awakened you?

**BIAN.**
==43==Ay, but not frighted me, therefore I’ll sleep again.

**PETR.**
==44==Nay, that you shall not, since you have begun;
==45==Have at you for a bitter jest or two!

**BIAN.**
==46==Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush,
==47==And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
==48==You are welcome all.

*Exit Bianca with Katherina and Widow.*

**PETR.**
==49==She hath prevented me. Here, *Signior* Tranio,
==50==This bird you aim’d at, though you hit her not;
==51==Therefore a health to all that shot and miss’d.

**TRA.**
==52==O, sir, Lucentio slipp’d me like his greyhound,
==53==Which runs himself, and catches for his master.

**PETR.**
==54==A good swift simile, but something currish.

**TRA.**
==55==’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself;
==56==’Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

**BAP.**
==57==O, O, Petruchio, Tranio hits you now.

**LUC.**
==58==I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

**HOR.**
==59==Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?

**PETR.**
==60==’A has a little gall’d me, I confess;
==61==And as the jest did glance away from me,
==62==’Tis ten to one it maim’d you two outright.

**BAP.**
==63==Now in good sadness, son Petruchio,
==64==I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

**PETR.**
==65==Well, I say no; and therefore for assurance
==66==Let’s each one send unto his wife,
==67==And he whose wife is most obedient,
==68==To come at first when he doth send for her,
==69==Shall win the wager which we will propose.

**HOR.**
==70==Content. What’s the wager?

**LUC.**
==70==              Twenty crowns.

**PETR.**
==71==Twenty crowns!
==72==I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
==73==But twenty times so much upon my wife.

**LUC.**
==74==A hundred then.

**HOR.**
==74==           Content.

**PETR.**
==74==                A match! ’Tis done.

**HOR.**
==75==Who shall begin?

**LUC.**
==75==           That will I.
==76==Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.

**BION.**
==77==I go.

*Exit.*

**BAP.**
==78==Son, I’ll be your half, Bianca comes.

**LUC.**
==79==I’ll have no halves; I’ll bear it all myself.
*(Enter Biondello.)*
==80==How now, what news?

**BION.**
==80==           Sir, my mistress sends you word
==81==That she is busy, and she cannot come.

**PETR.**
==82==How? She is busy, and she cannot come!
==83==Is that an answer?

**GRE.**
==83==           Ay, and a kind one too.
==84==Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

**PETR.**
==85==I hope better.

**HOR.**
==86==Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
==87==To come to me forthwith.

*Exit Biondello.*

**PETR.**
==87==              O ho, entreat her!
==88==Nay then she must needs come.

**HOR.**
==88==                I am afraid, sir,
==89==Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
*(Enter Biondello.)*
==90==Now, where’s my wife?

**BION.**
==91==She says you have some goodly jest in hand.
==92==She will not come; she bids you come to her.

**PETR.**
==93==Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
==94==Intolerable, not to be endur’d!
==95==Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress,
==96==Say I command her come to me.

*Exit Grumio.*

**HOR.**
==97==I know her answer.

**PETR.**
==97==              What?

**HOR.**
==97==                     She will not.

**PETR.**
==98==The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.

*Enter Katherina.*

**BAP.**
==99==Now, by my holidam, here comes Katherina!

**KATH.**
==100==What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

**PETR.**
==101==Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?

**KATH.**
==102==They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

**PETR.**
==103==Go fetch them hither. If they deny to come,
==104==Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.
==105==Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.

*Exit Katherina.*

**LUC.**
==106==Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

**HOR.**
==107==And so it is; I wonder what it bodes.

**PETR.**
==108==Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,
==109==An awe full rule, and right supremacy;
==110==And to be short, what not, that’s sweet and happy.

**BAP.**
==111==Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!
==112==The wager thou hast won, and I will add
==113==Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns,
==114==Another dowry to another daughter,
==115==For she is chang’d, as she had never been.

**PETR.**
==116==Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
==117==And show more sign of her obedience,
==118==Her new-built virtue and obedience.
*(Enter Kate, Bianca, and Widow.)*
==119==See where she comes, and brings your froward wives
==120==As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
==121==Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not;
==122==Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.

*Katherina throws down her cap.*

**WID.**
==123==Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
==124==Till I be brought to such a silly pass!

**BIAN.**
==125==Fie, what a foolish duty call you this?

**LUC.**
==126==I would your duty were as foolish too.
==127==The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
==128==Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time.

**BIAN.**
==129==The more fool you for laying on my duty.

**PETR.**
==130==Katherine, I charge thee tell these headstrong women
==131==What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

**WID.**
==132==Come, come, you’re mocking; we will have no telling.

**PETR.**
==133==Come on, I say, and first begin with her.

**WID.**
==134==She shall not.

**PETR.**
==135==I say she shall, and first begin with her.

**KATH.**
==136==Fie, fie, unknit that threat’ning unkind brow,
==137==And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
==138==To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.
==139==It blots thy beauty, as frosts do bite the meads,
==140==Confounds thy fame, as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
==141==And in no sense is meet or amiable.
==142==A woman mov’d is like a fountain troubled,
==143==Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty,
==144==And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
==145==Will deign to sip, or touch one drop of it.
==146==Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
==147==Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
==148==And for thy maintenance; commits his body
==149==To painful labor, both by sea and land;
==150==To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
==151==Whilst thou li’st warm at home, secure and safe;
==152==And craves no other tribute at thy hands
==153==But love, fair looks, and true obedience⁠—
==154==Too little payment for so great a debt.
==155==Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
==156==Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
==157==And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
==158==And not obedient to his honest will,
==159==What is she but a foul contending rebel,
==160==And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
==161==I am asham’d that women are so simple
==162==To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
==163==Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
==164==When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
==165==Why are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,
==166==Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
==167==But that our soft conditions, and our hearts,
==168==Should well agree with our external parts?
==169==Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
==170==My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
==171==My heart as great, my reason haply more,
==172==To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
==173==But now I see our lances are but straws,
==174==Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
==175==That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
==176==Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
==177==And place your hands below your husband’s foot;
==178==In token of which duty, if he please,
==179==My hand is ready, may it do him ease.

**PETR.**
==180==Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

**LUC.**
==181==Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha’t.

**VIN.**
==182==’Tis a good hearing when children are toward.

**LUC.**
==183==But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

**PETR.**
==184==Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.
==185==We three are married, but you two are sped.
*(To Lucentio.)*
==186==’Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white,
==187==And being a winner, God give you good night!

*Exit Petruchio with Katherina.*

**HOR.**
==188==Now go thy ways, thou hast tam’d a curst shrew.

**LUC.**
==189==’Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tam’d so.

*Exeunt.*
