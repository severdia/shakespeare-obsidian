## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Padua. Before Baptista’s house.*

*Enter Tranio as Lucentio, and the Pedant dress’d like Vincentio, booted and bare-headed.*

**TRA.**
Sir, this is the house, please it you that I call?

**PED.**
Ay, what else? And but I be deceived,
*Signior* Baptista may remember me
Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

**TRA.**
’Tis well, and hold your own in any case
With such austerity as ’longeth to a father.

*Enter Biondello.*

**PED.**
I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
’Twere good he were school’d.

**TRA.**
Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
Imagine ’twere the right Vincentio.

**BION.**
Tut, fear not me.

**TRA.**
But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

**BION.**
I told him that your father was at Venice,
And that you look’d for him this day in Padua.

**TRA.**
Th’ art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
Here comes Baptista; set your countenance, sir.
*(Enter Baptista and Lucentio as Cambio.)*
*Signior* Baptista, you are happily met.
*(To the Pedant.)*
Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.
I pray you stand good father to me now,
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

**PED.**
Soft, son!
Sir, by your leave, having come to Padua
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
Of love between your daughter and himself;
And for the good report I hear of you,
And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
And she to him, to stay him not too long,
I am content, in a good father’s care,
To have him match’d; and if you please to like
No worse than I, upon some agreement
Me shall you find ready and willing
With one consent to have her so bestowed;
For curious I cannot be with you,
*Signior* Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

**BAP.**
Sir, pardon me in what I have to say⁠—
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
And therefore if you say no more than this,
That like a father you will deal with him,
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
The match is made, and all is done:
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

**TRA.**
I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
We be affied and such assurance ta’en
As shall with either part’s agreement stand?

**BAP.**
Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
Besides, old Gremio is heark’ning still,
And happily we might be interrupted.

**TRA.**
Then at my lodging, and it like you.
There doth my father lie; and there this night
We’ll pass the business privately and well.
Send for your daughter by your servant here;
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
The worst is this, that at so slender warning,
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

**BAP.**
It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
And if you will, tell what hath happened:
Lucentio’s father is arriv’d in Padua,
And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife.

*Exit Lucentio.*

**BION.**
I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

**TRA.**
Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
*(Exit Biondello.)*
*(Enter Peter, a servant, who whispers to Tranio.)*
*Signior* Baptista, shall I lead the way?
Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer.
Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.

**BAP.**
I follow you.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Lucentio as Cambio and Biondello.*

**BION.**
Cambio!

**LUC.**
What say’st thou, Biondello?

**BION.**
You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

**LUC.**
Biondello, what of that?

**BION.**
Faith, nothing; but h’as left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

**LUC.**
I pray thee moralize them.

**BION.**
Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.

**LUC.**
And what of him?

**BION.**
His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

**LUC.**
And then?

**BION.**
The old priest of Saint Luke’s church is at your command at all hours.

**LUC.**
And what of all this?

**BION.**
I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance. Take you assurance of her, *cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum*; to th’ church take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses.
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say,
But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.

**LUC.**
Hear’st thou, Biondello?

**BION.**
I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir. And so *adieu*, sir; my master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.

*Exit.*

**LUC.**
I may and will, if she be so contented.
She will be pleas’d, then wherefore should I doubt?
Hap what hap may, I’ll roundly go about her;
It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

*Exit.*
