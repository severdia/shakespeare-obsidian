## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Padua. Before Baptista’s house.*

*Enter Tranio as Lucentio, and the Pedant dress’d like Vincentio, booted and bare-headed.*

**TRA.**
==1== Sir, this is the house, please it you that I call?

**PED.**
==2== Ay, what else? And but I be deceived,
==3== *Signior* Baptista may remember me
==4== Near twenty years ago in Genoa,
==5== Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

**TRA.**
==6== ’Tis well, and hold your own in any case
==7== With such austerity as ’longeth to a father.

*Enter Biondello.*

**PED.**
==8== I warrant you. But, sir, here comes your boy;
==9== ’Twere good he were school’d.

**TRA.**
==10== Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
==11== Now do your duty throughly, I advise you.
==12== Imagine ’twere the right Vincentio.

**BION.**
==13== Tut, fear not me.

**TRA.**
==14== But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

**BION.**
==15== I told him that your father was at Venice,
==16== And that you look’d for him this day in Padua.

**TRA.**
==17== Th’ art a tall fellow; hold thee that to drink.
==18== Here comes Baptista; set your countenance, sir.
*(Enter Baptista and Lucentio as Cambio.)*
==19== *Signior* Baptista, you are happily met.
*(To the Pedant.)*
==20== Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of.
==21== I pray you stand good father to me now,
==22== Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

**PED.**
==23== Soft, son!
==24== Sir, by your leave, having come to Padua
==25== To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
==26== Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
==27== Of love between your daughter and himself;
==28== And for the good report I hear of you,
==29== And for the love he beareth to your daughter,
==30== And she to him, to stay him not too long,
==31== I am content, in a good father’s care,
==32== To have him match’d; and if you please to like
==33== No worse than I, upon some agreement
==34== Me shall you find ready and willing
==35== With one consent to have her so bestowed;
==36== For curious I cannot be with you,
==37== *Signior* Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

**BAP.**
==38== Sir, pardon me in what I have to say⁠—
==39== Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
==40== Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
==41== Doth love my daughter, and she loveth him,
==42== Or both dissemble deeply their affections;
==43== And therefore if you say no more than this,
==44== That like a father you will deal with him,
==45== And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
==46== The match is made, and all is done:
==47== Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

**TRA.**
==48== I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
==49== We be affied and such assurance ta’en
==50== As shall with either part’s agreement stand?

**BAP.**
==51== Not in my house, Lucentio, for you know
==52== Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants;
==53== Besides, old Gremio is heark’ning still,
==54== And happily we might be interrupted.

**TRA.**
==55== Then at my lodging, and it like you.
==56== There doth my father lie; and there this night
==57== We’ll pass the business privately and well.
==58== Send for your daughter by your servant here;
==59== My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
==60== The worst is this, that at so slender warning,
==61== You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

**BAP.**
==62== It likes me well. Cambio, hie you home,
==63== And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
==64== And if you will, tell what hath happened:
==65== Lucentio’s father is arriv’d in Padua,
==66== And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife.

*Exit Lucentio.*

**BION.**
==67== I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

**TRA.**
==68== Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
*(Exit Biondello.)*
*(Enter Peter, a servant, who whispers to Tranio.)*
==69== *Signior* Baptista, shall I lead the way?
==70== Welcome! One mess is like to be your cheer.
==71== Come, sir, we will better it in Pisa.

**BAP.**
==72== I follow you.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Lucentio as Cambio and Biondello.*

**BION.**
==73== Cambio!

**LUC.**
==74== What say’st thou, Biondello?

**BION.**
==75== You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

**LUC.**
==76== Biondello, what of that?

**BION.**
==77== Faith, nothing; but h’as left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

**LUC.**
==78== I pray thee moralize them.

**BION.**
==79== Then thus: Baptista is safe, talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son.

**LUC.**
==80== And what of him?

**BION.**
==81== His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

**LUC.**
==82== And then?

**BION.**
==83== The old priest of Saint Luke’s church is at your command at all hours.

**LUC.**
==84== And what of all this?

**BION.**
==85== I cannot tell, except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance. Take you assurance of her, *cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum*; to th’ church take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient honest witnesses.
==86== If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say,
==87== But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.

**LUC.**
==88== Hear’st thou, Biondello?

**BION.**
==89== I cannot tarry. I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir. And so *adieu*, sir; my master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix.

*Exit.*

**LUC.**
==90== I may and will, if she be so contented.
==91== She will be pleas’d, then wherefore should I doubt?
==92== Hap what hap may, I’ll roundly go about her;
==93== It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

*Exit.*
