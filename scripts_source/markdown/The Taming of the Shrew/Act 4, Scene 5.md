## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*A public road.*

*Enter Petruchio, Kate, Hortensio, and Servants.*

**PETR.**
==1==Come on a’ God’s name, once more toward our father’s.
==2==Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

**KATH.**
==3==The moon! The sun—it is not moonlight now.

**PETR.**
==4==I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

**KATH.**
==5==I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

**PETR.**
==6==Now by my mother’s son, and that’s myself,
==7==It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
==8==Or ere I journey to your father’s house.⁠—
==9==Go on, and fetch our horses back again.⁠—
==10==Evermore cross’d and cross’d, nothing but cross’d!

**HOR.**
==11==Say as he says, or we shall never go.

**KATH.**
==12==Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
==13==And be it moon, or sun, or what you please;
==14==And if you please to call it a rush-candle,
==15==Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.

**PETR.**
==16==I say it is the moon.

**KATH.**
==16==           I know it is the moon.

**PETR.**
==17==Nay then you lie; it is the blessed sun.

**KATH.**
==18==Then God be blest, it is the blessed sun,
==19==But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
==20==And the moon changes even as your mind.
==21==What you will have it nam’d, even that it is,
==22==And so it shall be so for Katherine.

**HOR.**
==23==Petruchio, go thy ways, the field is won.

**PETR.**
==24==Well, forward, forward, thus the bowl should run,
==25==And not unluckily against the bias.
==26==But soft, company is coming here.
*(Enter Vincentio.)*
*(To Vincentio.)*
==27==Good morrow, gentle mistress, where away?
==28==Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
==29==Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
==30==Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
==31==What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
==32==As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
==33==Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
==34==Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty’s sake.

**HOR.**
==35==’A will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

**KATH.**
==36==Young budding virgin, fair, and fresh, and sweet,
==37==Whither away, or where is thy abode?
==38==Happy the parents of so fair a child!
==39==Happier the man whom favorable stars
==40==Allots thee for his lovely bedfellow!

**PETR.**
==41==Why, how now, Kate, I hope thou art not mad.
==42==This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, withered,
==43==And not a maiden, as thou say’st he is.

**KATH.**
==44==Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
==45==That have been so bedazzled with the sun,
==46==That every thing I look on seemeth green;
==47==Now I perceive thou are a reverend father.
==48==Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

**PETR.**
==49==Do, good old grandsire, and withal make known
==50==Which way thou travelest—if along with us,
==51==We shall be joyful of thy company.

**LORD.**
==52==Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
==53==That with your strange encounter much amaz’d me,
==54==My name is call’d Vincentio, my dwelling Pisa,
==55==And bound I am to Padua, there to visit
==56==A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

**PETR.**
==57==What is his name?

**LORD.**
==57==           Lucentio, gentle sir.

**PETR.**
==58==Happily met, the happier for thy son.
==59==And now by law, as well as reverend age,
==60==I may entitle thee my loving father.
==61==The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
==62==Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
==63==Nor be not grieved; she is of good esteem,
==64==Her dowry wealthy, and of worthy birth;
==65==Beside, so qualified as may beseem
==66==The spouse of any noble gentleman.
==67==Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
==68==And wander we to see thy honest son,
==69==Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

**LORD.**
==70==But is this true, or is it else your pleasure,
==71==Like pleasant travelers, to break a jest
==72==Upon the company you overtake?

**HOR.**
==73==I do assure thee, father, so it is.

**PETR.**
==74==Come go along and see the truth hereof,
==75==For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

*Exeunt all but Hortensio.*

**HOR.**
==76==Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
==77==Have to my widow! And if she be froward,
==78==Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

*Exit.*
