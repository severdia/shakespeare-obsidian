## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Padua. Before Hortensio’s house.*

*Enter Petruchio and his man Grumio.*

**PETR.**
==1== Verona, for a while I take my leave
==2== To see my friends in Padua, but of all
==3== My best beloved and approved friend,
==4== Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
==5== Here, sirrah Grumio, knock, I say.

**GRU.**
==6== Knock, sir? Whom should I knock? Is there any man has rebus’d your worship?

**PETR.**
==7== Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

**GRU.**
==8== Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?

**PETR.**
==9== Villain, I say, knock me at this gate,
==10== And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.

**GRU.**
==11== My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,
==12== And then I know after who comes by the worst.

**PETR.**
==13== Will it not be?
==14== Faith, sirrah, and you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it.
==15== I’ll try how you can *sol, fa*, and sing it.

*He wrings him by the ears.*

**GRU.**
==16== Help, masters, help, my master is mad.

**PETR.**
==17== Now knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

*Enter Hortensio.*

**HOR.**
==18== How now, what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio! And my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

**PETR.**
==19== *Signior* Hortensio, come you to part the fray? *Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato*, may I say.

**HOR.**
==20== *Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.*
==21== Rise, Grumio, rise, we will compound this quarrel.

**GRU.**
==22== Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service, look you, sir. He bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so, being perhaps (for aught I see) two and thirty, a peep out?
==23== Whom would to God I had well knock’d at first,
==24== Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

**PETR.**
==25== A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
==26== I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,
==27== And could not get him for my heart to do it.

**GRU.**
==28== Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words plain, “Sirrah, knock me here; rap me here; knock me well, and knock me soundly”? And come you now with “knocking at the gate”?

**PETR.**
==29== Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

**HOR.**
==30== Petruchio, patience, I am Grumio’s pledge.
==31== Why, this’ a heavy chance ’twixt him and you,
==32== Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
==33== And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
==34== Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

**PETR.**
==35== Such wind as scatters young men through the world
==36== To seek their fortunes farther than at home,
==37== Where small experience grows. But in a few,
==38== *Signior* Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
==39== Antonio, my father, is deceas’d,
==40== And I have thrust myself into this maze,
==41== Happily to wive and thrive as best I may.
==42== Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,
==43== And so am come abroad to see the world.

**HOR.**
==44== Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee,
==45== And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favor’d wife?
==46== Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel;
==47== And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,
==48== And very rich. But th’ art too much my friend,
==49== And I’ll not wish thee to her.

**PETR.**
==50== *Signior* Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we
==51== Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
==52== One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife
==53== (As wealth is burden of my wooing dance),
==54== Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love,
==55== As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd
==56== As Socrates’ Xantippe, or a worse,
==57== She moves me not, or not removes at least
==58== Affection’s edge in me. Whe’er she is as rough
==59== As are the swelling Adriatic seas,
==60== I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
==61== If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

**GRU.**
==62== Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough, and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.

**HOR.**
==63== Petruchio, since we are stepp’d thus far in,
==64== I will continue that I broach’d in jest.
==65== I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
==66== With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,
==67== Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.
==68== Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
==69== Is that she is intolerable curst
==70== And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,
==71== That were my state far worser than it is,
==72== I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

**PETR.**
==73== Hortensio, peace! Thou know’st not gold’s effect.
==74== Tell me her father’s name, and ’tis enough;
==75== For I will board her, though she chide as loud
==76== As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

**HOR.**
==77== Her father is Baptista Minola,
==78== An affable and courteous gentleman.
==79== Her name is Katherina Minola,
==80== Renown’d in Padua for her scolding tongue.

**PETR.**
==81== I know her father, though I know not her,
==82== And he knew my deceased father well.
==83== I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,
==84== And therefore let me be thus bold with you
==85== To give you over at this first encounter,
==86== Unless you will accompany me thither.

**GRU.**
==87== I pray you, sir, let him go while the humor lasts. A’ my word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so. Why, that’s nothing; and he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope-tricks. I’ll tell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it, that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.

**HOR.**
==88== Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
==89== For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is.
==90== He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
==91== His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,
==92== And her withholds from me and other more,
==93== Suitors to her and rivals in my love;
==94== Supposing it a thing impossible,
==95== For those defects I have before rehears’d,
==96== That ever Katherina will be woo’d.
==97== Therefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,
==98== That none shall have access unto Bianca
==99== Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.

**GRU.**
==100== Katherine the curst!
==101== A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

**HOR.**
==102== Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
==103== And offer me disguis’d in sober robes
==104== To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
==105== Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca,
==106== That so I may by this device at least
==107== Have leave and leisure to make love to her,
==108== And unsuspected court her by herself.

*Enter Gremio, and Lucentio disguised as Cambio, a schoolmaster.*

**GRU.**
==109== Here’s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks, how the young folks lay their heads together! Master, master, look about you! Who goes there? Ha!

**HOR.**
==110== Peace, Grumio, it is the rival of my love. Petruchio, stand by a while.

**GRU.**
==111== A proper stripling, and an amorous!

*They stand aside.*

**GRE.**
==112== O, very well, I have perus’d the note.
==113== Hark you, sir, I’ll have them very fairly bound⁠—
==114== All books of love, see that at any hand⁠—
==115== And see you read no other lectures to her.
==116== You understand me. Over and beside
==117== *Signior* Baptista’s liberality,
==118== I’ll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
==119== And let me have them very well perfum’d;
==120== For she is sweeter than perfume itself
==121== To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

**LUC.**
==122== What e’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you
==123== As for my patron, stand you so assur’d,
==124== As firmly as yourself were still in place,
==125== Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
==126== Than you—unless you were a scholar, sir.

**GRE.**
==127== O this learning, what a thing it is!

**GRU.**
==128== O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

**PETR.**
==129== Peace, sirrah!

**HOR.**
==130== Grumio, mum!
*(Coming forward.)*
==130==         God save you, *Signior* Gremio.

**GRE.**
==131== And you are well met, *Signior* Hortensio.
==132== Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
==133== I promis’d to inquire carefully
==134== About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca,
==135== And by good fortune I have lighted well
==136== On this young man; for learning and behavior
==137== Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
==138== And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

**HOR.**
==139== ’Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
==140== Hath promis’d me to help me to another,
==141== A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
==142== So shall I no whit be behind in duty
==143== To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.

**GRE.**
==144== Beloved of me, and that my deeds shall prove.

**GRU.**
==145== And that his bags shall prove.

**HOR.**
==146== Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love;
==147== Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
==148== I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either,
==149== Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
==150== Upon agreement from us to his liking,
==151== Will undertake to woo curst Katherine,
==152== Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

**GRE.**
==153== So said, so done, is well.
==154== Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

**PETR.**
==155== I know she is an irksome brawling scold.
==156== If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

**GRE.**
==157== No, say’st me so, friend? What countryman?

**PETR.**
==158== Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son.
==159== My father dead, my fortune lives for me,
==160== And I do hope good days and long to see.

**GRE.**
==161== O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange;
==162== But if you have a stomach, to’t a’ God’s name;
==163== You shall have me assisting you in all.
==164== But will you woo this wild-cat?

**PETR.**
==164==                   Will I live?

**GRU.**
==165== Will he woo her? Ay—or I’ll hang her.

**PETR.**
==166== Why came I hither but to that intent?
==167== Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
==168== Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
==169== Have I not heard the sea, puff’d up with winds,
==170== Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
==171== Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
==172== And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?
==173== Have I not in a pitched battle heard
==174== Loud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?
==175== And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,
==176== That gives not half so great a blow to hear
==177== As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire?
==178== Tush, tush, fear boys with bugs.

**GRU.**
==178==                   For he fears none.

**GRE.**
==179== Hortensio, hark.
==180== This gentleman is happily arriv’d,
==181== My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.

**HOR.**
==182== I promis’d we would be contributors,
==183== And bear his charge of wooing, whatsoe’er.

**GRE.**
==184== And so we will, provided that he win her.

**GRU.**
==185== I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

*Enter Tranio brave, as Lucentio, and Biondello.*

**TRA.**
==186== Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
==187== Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
==188== To the house of *Signior* Baptista Minola?

**BION.**
==189== He that has the two fair daughters? Is’t he you mean?

**TRA.**
==190== Even he, Biondello.

**GRE.**
==191== Hark you, sir, you mean not her to⁠—

**TRA.**
==192== Perhaps him and her, sir; what have you to do?

**PETR.**
==193== Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

**TRA.**
==194== I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let’s away.

**LUC.**
*(Aside.)*
==195== Well begun, Tranio.

**HOR.**
==195==            Sir, a word ere you go.
==196== Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?

**TRA.**
==197== And if I be, sir, is it any offense?

**GRE.**
==198== No; if without more words you will get you hence.

**TRA.**
==199== Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
==200== For me as for you?

**GRE.**
==200==            But so is not she.

**TRA.**
==201== For what reason, I beseech you?

**GRE.**
==201==                 For this reason, if you’ll know,
==202== That she’s the choice love of *Signior* Gremio.

**HOR.**
==203== That she’s the chosen of *Signior* Hortensio.

**TRA.**
==204== Softly, my masters! If you be gentlemen,
==205== Do me this right: hear me with patience.
==206== Baptista is a noble gentleman,
==207== To whom my father is not all unknown,
==208== And were his daughter fairer than she is,
==209== She may more suitors have, and me for one.
==210== Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers,
==211== Then well one more may fair Bianca have;
==212== And so she shall. Lucentio shall make one,
==213== Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

**GRE.**
==214== What, this gentleman will out-talk us all.

**LUC.**
==215== Sir, give him head, I know he’ll prove a jade.

**PETR.**
==216== Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

**HOR.**
==217== Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
==218== Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?

**TRA.**
==219== No, sir, but hear I do that he hath two:
==220== The one as famous for a scolding tongue,
==221== As is the other for beauteous modesty.

**PETR.**
==222== Sir, sir, the first’s for me, let her go by.

**GRE.**
==223== Yea, leave that labor to great Hercules,
==224== And let it be more than Alcides’ twelve.

**PETR.**
==225== Sir, understand you this of me, in sooth:
==226== The youngest daughter, whom you hearken for,
==227== Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
==228== And will not promise her to any man,
==229== Until the elder sister first be wed.
==230== The younger then is free, and not before.

**TRA.**
==231== If it be so, sir, that you are the man
==232== Must stead us all, and me amongst the rest;
==233== And if you break the ice, and do this feat,
==234== Achieve the elder, set the younger free
==235== For our access—whose hap shall be to have her
==236== Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

**HOR.**
==237== Sir, you say well, and well you do conceive,
==238== And since you do profess to be a suitor,
==239== You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
==240== To whom we all rest generally beholding.

**TRA.**
==241== Sir, I shall not be slack; in sign whereof,
==242== Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
==243== And quaff carouses to our mistress’ health,
==244== And do as adversaries do in law,
==245== Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

**GRU., BION.**
==246== O excellent motion! Fellows, let’s be gone.

**HOR.**
==247== The motion’s good indeed, and be it so,
==248== Petruchio, I shall be your *ben venuto*.

*Exeunt.*
