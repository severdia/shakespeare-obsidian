## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Padua. Baptista’s house.*

*Enter Lucentio as Cambio, Hortensio as Litio, and Bianca.*

**LUC.**
==1==Fiddler, forbear, you grow too forward, sir.
==2==Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
==3==Her sister Katherine welcom’d you withal?

**HOR.**
==4==But, wrangling pedant, this is
==5==The patroness of heavenly harmony.
==6==Then give me leave to have prerogative,
==7==And when in music we have spent an hour,
==8==Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

**LUC.**
==9==Preposterous ass, that never read so far
==10==To know the cause why music was ordain’d!
==11==Was it not to refresh the mind of man
==12==After his studies or his usual pain?
==13==Then give me leave to read philosophy,
==14==And while I pause, serve in your harmony.

**HOR.**
==15==Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.

**BIAN.**
==16==Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong
==17==To strive for that which resteth in my choice.
==18==I am no breeching scholar in the schools,
==19==I’ll not be tied to hours, nor ’pointed times,
==20==But learn my lessons as I please myself.
==21==And to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
==22==Take you your instrument, play you the whiles,
==23==His lecture will be done ere you have tun’d.

**HOR.**
==24==You’ll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

**LUC.**
==25==That will be never, tune your instrument.

**BIAN.**
==26==Where left we last?

**LUC.**
==27==Here, madam:
==28==*“Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;*
==29==*Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.”*

**BIAN.**
==30==Construe them.

**LUC.**
==31==*“Hic ibat,”* as I told you before, *“Simois,”* I am Lucentio, *“hic est,”* son unto Vincentio of Pisa, *“Sigeia tellus,”* disguis’d thus to get your love, *“Hic steterat,”* and that Lucentio that comes a-wooing, *“Priami,”* is my man Tranio, *“regia,”* bearing my port, *“celsa senis,”* that we might beguile the old pantaloon.

**HOR.**
==32==Madam, my instrument’s in tune.

**BIAN.**
==33==Let’s hear. O fie, the treble jars.

**LUC.**
==34==Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

**BIAN.**
==35==Now let me see if I can construe it: *“Hic ibat Simois,”* I know you not, *“hic est Sigeia tellus,”* I trust you not, *“Hic steterat Priami,”* take heed he hear us not, *“regia,”* presume not, *“celsa senis,”* despair not.

**HOR.**
==36==Madam, ’tis now in tune.

**LUC.**
==36==              All but the base.

**HOR.**
==37==The base is right, ’tis the base knave that jars.
*(Aside.)*
==38==How fiery and forward our pedant is!
==39==Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
==40==*Pedascule*, I’ll watch you better yet.

**BIAN.**
==41==In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

**LUC.**
==42==Mistrust it not, for sure Aeacides
==43==Was Ajax, call’d so from his grandfather.

**BIAN.**
==44==I must believe my master, else, I promise you,
==45==I should be arguing still upon that doubt.
==46==But let it rest. Now, Litio, to you:
==47==Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,
==48==That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

**HOR.**
*(To Lucentio.)*
==49==You may go walk, and give me leave a while;
==50==My lessons make no music in three parts.

**LUC.**
==51==Are you so formal, sir? Well, I must wait,
*(Aside.)*
==52==And watch withal, for but I be deceiv’d,
==53==Our fine musician groweth amorous.

**HOR.**
==54==Madam, before you touch the instrument,
==55==To learn the order of my fingering,
==56==I must begin with rudiments of art,
==57==To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
==58==More pleasant, pithy, and effectual,
==59==Than hath been taught by any of my trade;
==60==And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

**BIAN.**
==61==Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

**HOR.**
==62==Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

**BIAN.**
*(Reads.)*
==63==*“Gamut I am, the ground of all accord:*
==64==*A re, to plead Hortensio’s passion;*
==65==*B mi, Bianca, take him for thy lord,*
==66==*C fa ut, that loves with all affection.*
==67==*D sol re, one cliff, two notes have I,*
==68==*E la mi, show pity, or I die.”*
==69==Call you this gamut? Tut, I like it not.
==70==Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice
==71==To change true rules for odd inventions.

*Enter Baptista’s Messenger.*

**BAP. MESS.**
==72==Mistress, your father prays you leave your books,
==73==And help to dress your sister’s chamber up.
==74==You know tomorrow is the wedding-day.

**BIAN.**
==75==Farewell, sweet masters both, I must be gone.

*Exeunt Bianca and Baptista’s Messenger.*

**LUC.**
==76==Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.

*Exit.*

**HOR.**
==77==But I have cause to pry into this pedant.
==78==Methinks he looks as though he were in love;
==79==Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
==80==To cast thy wand’ring eyes on every stale,
==81==Seize thee that list. If once I find thee ranging,
==82==Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

*Exit.*
