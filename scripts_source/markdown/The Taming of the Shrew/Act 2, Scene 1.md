## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Padua. A room in Baptista Minola’s house.*

*Enter Katherina and Bianca.*

**BIAN.**
==1==Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
==2==To make a bondmaid and a slave of me⁠—
==3==That I disdain; but for these other gawds,
==4==Unbind my hands, I’ll pull them off myself,
==5==Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat,
==6==Or what you will command me will I do,
==7==So well I know my duty to my elders.

**KATH.**
==8==Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell
==9==Whom thou lov’st best; see thou dissemble not.

**BIAN.**
==10==Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
==11==I never yet beheld that special face
==12==Which I could fancy more than any other.

**KATH.**
==13==Minion, thou liest. Is’t not Hortensio?

**BIAN.**
==14==If you affect him, sister, here I swear
==15==I’ll plead for you myself, but you shall have him.

**KATH.**
==16==O then belike you fancy riches more:
==17==You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

**BIAN.**
==18==Is it for him you do envy me so?
==19==Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
==20==You have but jested with me all this while.
==21==I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

**KATH.**
==22==If that be jest, then all the rest was so.

*Strikes her.*

*Enter Baptista.*

**BAP.**
==23==Why, how now, dame, whence grows this insolence?
==24==Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl, she weeps.
==25==Go ply thy needle, meddle not with her.
==26==For shame, thou hilding of a devilish spirit,
==27==Why dost thou wrong her that did ne’er wrong thee?
==28==When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

**KATH.**
==29==Her silence flouts me, and I’ll be reveng’d.

*Flies after Bianca.*

**BAP.**
==30==What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.

*Exit Bianca.*

**KATH.**
==31==What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
==32==She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
==33==I must dance barefoot on her wedding-day,
==34==And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
==35==Talk not to me, I will go sit and weep,
==36==Till I can find occasion of revenge.

*Exit.*

**BAP.**
==37==Was ever gentleman thus griev’d as I?
==38==But who comes here?

*Enter Gremio, Lucentio in the habit of a mean man, Petruchio with Hortensio as a musician Litio, and Tranio as Lucentio with his boy Biondello bearing a lute and books.*

**GRE.**
==39==Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.

**BAP.**
==40==Good morrow, neighbor Gremio. God save you, gentlemen!

**PETR.**
==41==And you, good sir! Pray have you not a daughter
==42==Call’d Katherina, fair and virtuous?

**BAP.**
==43==I have a daughter, sir, call’d Katherina.

**GRE.**
==44==You are too blunt, go to it orderly.

**PETR.**
==45==You wrong me, *Signior* Gremio, give me leave.
==46==I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
==47==That hearing of her beauty and her wit,
==48==Her affability and bashful modesty,
==49==Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
==50==Am bold to show myself a forward guest
==51==Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
==52==Of that report which I so oft have heard.
==53==And for an entrance to my entertainment,
==54==I do present you with a man of mine,
*(Presenting Hortensio.)*
==55==Cunning in music and the mathematics,
==56==To instruct her fully in those sciences,
==57==Whereof I know she is not ignorant.
==58==Accept of him, or else you do me wrong.
==59==His name is Litio, born in Mantua.

**BAP.**
==60==Y’ are welcome, sir, and he, for your good sake.
==61==But for my daughter Katherine, this I know,
==62==She is not for your turn, the more my grief.

**PETR.**
==63==I see you do not mean to part with her,
==64==Or else you like not of my company.

**BAP.**
==65==Mistake me not, I speak but as I find.
==66==Whence are you, sir? What may I call your name?

**PETR.**
==67==Petruchio is my name, Antonio’s son,
==68==A man well known throughout all Italy.

**BAP.**
==69==I know him well; you are welcome for his sake.

**GRE.**
==70==Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray
==71==Let us that are poor petitioners speak too.
==72==*Backare*! You are marvelous forward.

**PETR.**
==73==O, pardon me, *Signior* Gremio, I would fain be doing.

**GRE.**
==74==I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your wooing.
==75==Neighbor, this is a gift very grateful, I am sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself, that have been more kindly beholding to you than any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
*(Presenting Lucentio.)*
==76==that hath been long studying at Rheims, as cunning in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other in music and mathematics. His name is Cambio; pray accept his service.

**BAP.**
==77==A thousand thanks, *Signior* Gremio. Welcome, good Cambio.
*(To Tranio.)*
==78==But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger. May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?

**TRA.**
==79==Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
==80==That being a stranger in this city here,
==81==Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
==82==Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
==83==Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
==84==In the preferment of the eldest sister.
==85==This liberty is all that I request,
==86==That upon knowledge of my parentage,
==87==I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo,
==88==And free access and favor as the rest;
==89==And toward the education of your daughters,
==90==I here bestow a simple instrument,
==91==And this small packet of Greek and Latin books.
==92==If you accept them, then their worth is great.

**BAP.**
==93==Lucentio is your name, of whence, I pray?

**TRA.**
==94==Of Pisa, sir, son to Vincentio.

**BAP.**
==95==A mighty man of Pisa; by report
==96==I know him well. You are very welcome, sir.
==97==Take you the lute, and you the set of books.
==98==You shall go see your pupils presently.
==99==Holla, within!
*(Enter Baptista’s Servant.)*
==99==        Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
==100==To my daughters, and tell them both,
==101==These are their tutors. Bid them use them well.
*(Exit Baptista’s Servant with Lucentio and Hortensio, Biondello following.)*
==102==We will go walk a little in the orchard,
==103==And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
==104==And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

**PETR.**
==105==*Signior* Baptista, my business asketh haste,
==106==And every day I cannot come to woo.
==107==You knew my father well, and in him me,
==108==Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
==109==Which I have bettered rather than decreas’d.
==110==Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love,
==111==What dowry shall I have with her to wife?

**BAP.**
==112==After my death, the one half of my lands,
==113==And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

**PETR.**
==114==And for that dowry, I’ll assure her of
==115==Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
==116==In all my lands and leases whatsoever.
==117==Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
==118==That covenants may be kept on either hand.

**BAP.**
==119==Ay, when the special thing is well obtain’d,
==120==That is, her love; for that is all in all.

**PETR.**
==121==Why, that is nothing; for I tell you, father,
==122==I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
==123==And where two raging fires meet together,
==124==They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
==125==Though little fire grows great with little wind,
==126==Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all;
==127==So I to her, and so she yields to me,
==128==For I am rough, and woo not like a babe.

**BAP.**
==129==Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
==130==But be thou arm’d for some unhappy words.

**PETR.**
==131==Ay, to the proof, as mountains are for winds,
==132==That shake not, though they blow perpetually.

*Enter Hortensio as Litio with his head broke.*

**BAP.**
==133==How now, my friend, why dost thou look so pale?

**HOR.**
==134==For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

**BAP.**
==135==What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

**HOR.**
==136==I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier,
==137==Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

**BAP.**
==138==Why then thou canst not break her to the lute?

**HOR.**
==139==Why no, for she hath broke the lute to me.
==140==I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
==141==And bow’d her hand to teach her fingering;
==142==When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
==143==“Frets, call you these?” quoth she, “I’ll fume with them.”
==144==And with that word she struck me on the head,
==145==And through the instrument my pate made way,
==146==And there I stood amazed for a while,
==147==As on a pillory, looking through the lute,
==148==While she did call me rascal fiddler
==149==And twangling Jack, with twenty such vild terms,
==150==As had she studied to misuse me so.

**PETR.**
==151==Now by the world, it is a lusty wench!
==152==I love her ten times more than e’er I did.
==153==O, how I long to have some chat with her!

**BAP.**
==154==Well, go with me and be not so discomfited.
==155==Proceed in practice with my younger daughter;
==156==She’s apt to learn, and thankful for good turns.
==157==*Signior* Petruchio, will you go with us,
==158==Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

**PETR.**
==159==I pray you do. I’ll attend her here,
*(Exit Baptista with Gremio, Tranio, and Hortensio. Manet Petruchio.)*
==160==And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
==161==Say that she rail, why then I’ll tell her plain
==162==She sings as sweetly as a nightingale;
==163==Say that she frown, I’ll say she looks as clear
==164==As morning roses newly wash’d with dew;
==165==Say she be mute, and will not speak a word,
==166==Then I’ll commend her volubility,
==167==And say she uttereth piercing eloquence;
==168==If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks,
==169==As though she bid me stay by her a week;
==170==If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day
==171==When I shall ask the banes, and when be married.
==172==But here she comes, and now, Petruchio, speak.
*(Enter Katherina.)*
==173==Good morrow, Kate, for that’s your name, I hear.

**KATH.**
==174==Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
==175==They call me Katherine that do talk of me.

**PETR.**
==176==You lie, in faith, for you are call’d plain Kate,
==177==And bonny Kate, and sometimes Kate the curst;
==178==But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom,
==179==Kate of Kate-Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
==180==For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
==181==Take this of me, Kate of my consolation⁠—
==182==Hearing thy mildness prais’d in every town,
==183==Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
==184==Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
==185==Myself am mov’d to woo thee for my wife.

**KATH.**
==186==Mov’d! In good time! Let him that mov’d you hither
==187==Remove you hence. I knew you at the first
==188==You were a moveable.

**PETR.**
==188==           Why, what’s a moveable?

**KATH.**
==189==A join’d-stool.

**PETR.**
==189==        Thou hast hit it; come sit on me.

**KATH.**
==190==Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

**PETR.**
==191==Women are made to bear, and so are you.

**KATH.**
==192==No such jade as you, if me you mean.

**PETR.**
==193==Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee,
==194==For knowing thee to be but young and light.

**KATH.**
==195==Too light for such a swain as you to catch,
==196==And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

**PETR.**
==197==Should be! Should—buzz!

**KATH.**
==197==              Well ta’en, and like a buzzard.

**PETR.**
==198==O slow-wing’d turtle, shall a buzzard take thee?

**KATH.**
==199==Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

**PETR.**
==200==Come, come, you wasp, i’faith you are too angry.

**KATH.**
==201==If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

**PETR.**
==202==My remedy is then to pluck it out.

**KATH.**
==203==Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies.

**PETR.**
==204==Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?
==205==In his tail.

**KATH.**
==206==In his tongue.

**PETR.**
==207==Whose tongue?

**KATH.**
==208==Yours, if you talk of tales, and so farewell.

**PETR.**
==209==What, with my tongue in your tail? Nay, come again,
==210==Good Kate; I am a gentleman⁠—

**KATH.**
==210==                That I’ll try.

*She strikes him.*

**PETR.**
==211==I swear I’ll cuff you, if you strike again.

**KATH.**
==212==So may you lose your arms.
==213==If you strike me, you are no gentleman,
==214==And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

**PETR.**
==215==A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

**KATH.**
==216==What is your crest? A coxcomb?

**PETR.**
==217==A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

**KATH.**
==218==No cock of mine, you crow too like a craven.

**PETR.**
==219==Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

**KATH.**
==220==It is my fashion when I see a crab.

**PETR.**
==221==Why, here’s no crab, and therefore look not sour.

**KATH.**
==222==There is, there is.

**PETR.**
==223==Then show it me.

**KATH.**
==224==Had I a glass, I would.

**PETR.**
==225==What, you mean my face?

**KATH.**
==226==Well aim’d of such a young one.

**PETR.**
==227==Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

**KATH.**
==228==Yet you are wither’d.

**PETR.**
==229==’Tis with cares.

**KATH.**
==230==I care not.

**PETR.**
==231==Nay, hear you, Kate. In sooth you scape not so.

**KATH.**
==232==I chafe you if I tarry. Let me go.

**PETR.**
==233==No, not a whit, I find you passing gentle:
==234==’Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
==235==And now I find report a very liar;
==236==For thou art pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
==237==But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers.
==238==Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askaunce,
==239==Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
==240==Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk;
==241==But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers,
==242==With gentle conference, soft, and affable.
==243==Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
==244==O sland’rous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
==245==Is straight and slender, and as brown in hue
==246==As hazel-nuts, and sweeter than the kernels.
==247==O, let me see thee walk. Thou dost not halt.

**KATH.**
==248==Go, fool, and whom thou keep’st command.

**PETR.**
==249==Did ever Dian so become a grove
==250==As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
==251==O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate,
==252==And then let Kate be chaste, and Dian sportful!

**KATH.**
==253==Where did you study all this goodly speech?

**PETR.**
==254==It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

**KATH.**
==255==A witty mother! Witless else her son.

**PETR.**
==256==Am I not wise?

**KATH.**
==257==Yes, keep you warm.

**PETR.**
==258==Marry, so I mean, sweet Katherine, in thy bed;
==259==And therefore setting all this chat aside,
==260==Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
==261==That you shall be my wife; your dowry ’greed on;
==262==And will you, nill you, I will marry you.
==263==Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn,
==264==For by this light whereby I see thy beauty,
==265==Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
==266==Thou must be married to no man but me;
==267==For I am he am born to tame you, Kate,
==268==And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
==269==Conformable as other household Kates.
*(Enter Baptista, Gremio, Tranio as Lucentio.)*
==270==Here comes your father. Never make denial;
==271==I must and will have Katherine to my wife.

**BAP.**
==272==Now, *Signior* Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

**PETR.**
==273==How but well, sir? How but well?
==274==It were impossible I should speed amiss.

**BAP.**
==275==Why, how now, daughter Katherine, in your dumps?

**KATH.**
==276==Call you me daughter? Now I promise you
==277==You have show’d a tender fatherly regard,
==278==To wish me wed to one half lunatic,
==279==A madcap ruffian and a swearing Jack,
==280==That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

**PETR.**
==281==Father, ’tis thus: yourself and all the world,
==282==That talk’d of her, have talk’d amiss of her.
==283==If she be curst, it is for policy,
==284==For she’s not froward, but modest as the dove;
==285==She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
==286==For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
==287==And Roman Lucrece for her chastity;
==288==And to conclude, we have ’greed so well together
==289==That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

**KATH.**
==290==I’ll see thee hang’d on Sunday first.

**GRE.**
==291==Hark, Petruchio, she says she’ll see thee hang’d first.

**TRA.**
==292==Is this your speeding? Nay then good night our part!

**PETR.**
==293==Be patient, gentlemen, I choose her for myself.
==294==If she and I be pleas’d, what’s that to you?
==295==’Tis bargain’d ’twixt us twain, being alone,
==296==That she shall still be curst in company.
==297==I tell you ’tis incredible to believe
==298==How much she loves me. O, the kindest Kate,
==299==She hung about my neck, and kiss on kiss
==300==She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
==301==That in a twink she won me to her love.
==302==O, you are novices! ’tis a world to see
==303==How tame, when men and women are alone,
==304==A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
==305==Give me thy hand, Kate, I will unto Venice
==306==To buy apparel ’gainst the wedding-day.
==307==Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests,
==308==I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine.

**BAP.**
==309==I know not what to say, but give me your hands.
==310==God send you joy, Petruchio, ’tis a match.

**BOTH GRE. AND TRA.**
==311==Amen, say we. We will be witnesses.

**PETR.**
==312==Father, and wife, and gentlemen, *adieu*.
==313==I will to Venice, Sunday comes apace.
==314==We will have rings and things, and fine array;
==315==And kiss me, Kate, we will be married a’ Sunday.

*Exeunt Petruchio and Katherine severally.*

**GRE.**
==316==Was ever match clapp’d up so suddenly?

**BAP.**
==317==Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant’s part,
==318==And venture madly on a desperate mart.

**TRA.**
==319==’Twas a commodity lay fretting by you;
==320==’Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

**BAP.**
==321==The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

**GRE.**
==322==No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
==323==But now, Baptista, to your younger daughter;
==324==Now is the day we long have looked for.
==325==I am your neighbor, and was suitor first.

**TRA.**
==326==And I am one that love Bianca more
==327==Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.

**GRE.**
==328==Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

**TRA.**
==329==Greybeard, thy love doth freeze.

**GRE.**
==329==                  But thine doth fry.
==330==Skipper, stand back, ’tis age that nourisheth.

**TRA.**
==331==But youth in ladies’ eyes that flourisheth.

**BAP.**
==332==Content you, gentlemen, I will compound this strife.
==333==’Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both
==334==That can assure my daughter greatest dower
==335==Shall have my Bianca’s love.
==336==Say, *Signior* Gremio, what can you assure her?

**GRE.**
==337==First, as you know, my house within the city
==338==Is richly furnished with plate and gold,
==339==Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
==340==My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
==341==In ivory coffers I have stuff’d my crowns;
==342==In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
==343==Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
==344==Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss’d with pearl,
==345==Valance of Venice gold in needle-work;
==346==Pewter and brass, and all things that belongs
==347==To house or house-keeping. Then at my farm
==348==I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
==349==Six score fat oxen standing in my stalls,
==350==And all things answerable to this portion.
==351==Myself am struck in years, I must confess,
==352==And if I die tomorrow, this is hers,
==353==If whilst I live she will be only mine.

**TRA.**
==354==That “only” came well in. Sir, list to me:
==355==I am my father’s heir and only son.
==356==If I may have your daughter to my wife,
==357==I’ll leave her houses three or four as good,
==358==Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
==359==Old *Signior* Gremio has in Padua,
==360==Besides two thousand ducats by the year
==361==Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointer.
==362==What, have I pinch’d you, *Signior* Gremio?

**GRE.**
==363==Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
*(Aside.)*
==364==My land amounts not to so much in all.⁠—
==365==That she shall have, besides an argosy
==366==That now is lying in Marsellis road.
==367==What, have I chok’d you with an argosy?

**TRA.**
==368==Gremio, ’tis known my father hath no less
==369==Than three great argosies, besides two galliasses
==370==And twelve tight galleys. These I will assure her,
==371==And twice as much, what e’er thou off’rest next.

**GRE.**
==372==Nay, I have off’red all, I have no more,
==373==And she can have no more than all I have;
==374==If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

**TRA.**
==375==Why then the maid is mine from all the world,
==376==By your firm promise; Gremio is outvied.

**BAP.**
==377==I must confess your offer is the best,
==378==And let your father make her the assurance,
==379==She is your own, else you must pardon me;
==380==If you should die before him, where’s her dower?

**TRA.**
==381==That’s but a cavil; he is old, I young.

**GRE.**
==382==And may not young men die as well as old?

**BAP.**
==383==Well, gentlemen,
==384==I am thus resolv’d: on Sunday next you know
==385==My daughter Katherine is to be married.
==386==Now on the Sunday following shall Bianca
==387==Be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
==388==If not, to *Signior* Gremio.
==389==And so I take my leave, and thank you both.

*Exit.*

**GRE.**
==390==*Adieu*, good neighbor. Now I fear thee not.
==391==Sirrah, young gamester, your father were a fool
==392==To give thee all, and in his waning age
==393==Set foot under thy table. Tut, a toy!
==394==An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

*Exit.*

**TRA.**
==395==A vengeance on your crafty withered hide!
==396==Yet I have fac’d it with a card of ten.
==397==’Tis in my head to do my master good.
==398==I see no reason but suppos’d Lucentio
==399==Must get a father, call’d suppos’d Vincentio;
==400==And that’s a wonder. Fathers commonly
==401==Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
==402==A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

*Exit.*
