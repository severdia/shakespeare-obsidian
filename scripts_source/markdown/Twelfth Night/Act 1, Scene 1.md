## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Illyria. A room in Duke Orsino’s palace.*

*Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords; Musicians attending.*

**DUKE.**
==1==If music be the food of love, play on,
==2==Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,
==3==The appetite may sicken, and so die.
==4==That strain again, it had a dying fall;
==5==O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound
==6==That breathes upon a bank of violets,
==7==Stealing and giving odor. Enough, no more,
==8==’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
==9==O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,
==10==That notwithstanding thy capacity
==11==Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
==12==Of what validity and pitch soe’er,
==13==But falls into abatement and low price
==14==Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy
==15==That it alone is high fantastical.

**CUR.**
==16==Will you go hunt, my lord?

**DUKE.**
==16==              What, Curio?

**CUR.**
==16==                     The hart.

**DUKE.**
==17==Why, so I do, the noblest that I have.
==18==O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
==19==Methought she purg’d the air of pestilence!
==20==That instant was I turn’d into a hart,
==21==And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
==22==E’er since pursue me.
*(Enter Valentine.)*
==22==           How now, what news from her?

**VAL.**
==23==So please my lord, I might not be admitted,
==24==But from her handmaid do return this answer:
==25==The element itself, till seven years’ heat,
==26==Shall not behold her face at ample view;
==27==But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,
==28==And water once a day her chamber round
==29==With eye-offending brine; all this to season
==30==A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh
==31==And lasting in her sad remembrance.

**DUKE.**
==32==O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
==33==To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
==34==How will she love when the rich golden shaft
==35==Hath kill’d the flock of all affections else
==36==That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
==37==These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill’d
==38==Her sweet perfections with one self king!
==39==Away before me to sweet beds of flow’rs,
==40==Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bow’rs.

*Exeunt.*
