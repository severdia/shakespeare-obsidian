## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Olivia’s garden.*

*Enter Sebastian.*

**SEB.**
==1== This is the air, that is the glorious sun,
==2== This pearl she gave me, I do feel’t and see’t,
==3== And though ’tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
==4== Yet ’tis not madness. Where’s Antonio then?
==5== I could not find him at the Elephant,
==6== Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,
==7== That he did range the town to seek me out.
==8== His counsel now might do me golden service,
==9== For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
==10== That this may be some error, but no madness,
==11== Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
==12== So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
==13== That I am ready to distrust mine eyes,
==14== And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
==15== To any other trust but that I am mad,
==16== Or else the lady’s mad; yet if ’twere so,
==17== She could not sway her house, command her followers,
==18== Take and give back affairs, and their dispatch,
==19== With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing
==20== As I perceive she does. There’s something in’t
==21== That is deceivable. But here the lady comes.

*Enter Olivia and Priest.*

**OLI.**
==22== Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
==23== Now go with me, and with this holy man,
==24== Into the chantry by; there, before him,
==25== And underneath that consecrated roof,
==26== Plight me the full assurance of your faith,
==27== That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
==28== May live at peace. He shall conceal it
==29== Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
==30== What time we will our celebration keep
==31== According to my birth. What do you say?

**SEB.**
==32== I’ll follow this good man, and go with you,
==33== And having sworn truth, ever will be true.

**OLI.**
==34== Then lead the way, good father, and heavens so shine
==35== That they may fairly note this act of mine!

*Exeunt.*
