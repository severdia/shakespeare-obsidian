## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Illyria, A street adjoining Olivia’s house.*

*Enter Sebastian and Clown.*

**CLO.**
==1==Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?

**SEB.**
==2==Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow,
==3==Let me be clear of thee.

**CLO.**
==4==Well held out, i’faith! No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neither: nothing that is so is so.

**SEB.**
==5==I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else,
==6==Thou know’st not me.

**CLO.**
==7==Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber the world will prove a cockney. I prithee now ungird thy strangeness, and tell me what I shall vent to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?

**SEB.**
==8==I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.
==9==There’s money for thee. If you tarry longer,
==10==I shall give worse payment.

**CLO.**
==11==By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report—after fourteen years’ purchase.

*Enter Andrew, Toby, and Fabian.*

**SIR AND.**
==12==Now, sir, have I met you again? There’s for you.

*Strikes Sebastian.*

**SEB.**
==13==Why, there’s for thee, and there, and there.
*(Strikes Sir Andrew.)*
==14==Are all the people mad?

*Draws his dagger.*

**SIR TO.**
==15==Hold, sir, or I’ll throw your dagger o’er the house.

*Seizes Sebastian’s arm.*

**CLO.**
==16==This will I tell my lady straight; I would not be in some of your coats for twopence.

*Exit.*

**SIR TO.**
==17==Come on, sir, hold!

**SIR AND.**
==18==Nay, let him alone. I’ll go another way to work with him; I’ll have an action of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck him first, yet it’s no matter for that.

**SEB.**
==19==Let go thy hand.

**SIR TO.**
==20==Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron; you are well flesh’d. Come on.

**SEB.**
==21==I will be free from thee.
*(Breaks away and draws his sword.)*
==22==What wouldst thou now?
==23==If thou dar’st tempt me further, draw thy sword.

**SIR TO.**
==24==What, what? Nay then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you.

*Draws.*

*Enter Olivia.*

**OLI.**
==25==Hold, Toby, on thy life I charge thee hold!

**SIR TO.**
==26==Madam⁠—

**OLI.**
==27==Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
==28==Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
==29==Where manners ne’er were preach’d! Out of my sight!
==30==Be not offended, dear Cesario.
==31==Rudesby, be gone!
*(Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew, and Fabian.)*
==31==           I prithee, gentle friend,
==32==Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
==33==In this uncivil and unjust extent
==34==Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
==35==And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
==36==This ruffian hath botch’d up, that thou thereby
==37==Mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go;
==38==Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
==39==He started one poor heart of mine, in thee.

**SEB.**
==40==What relish is in this? How runs the stream?
==41==Or I am mad, or else this is a dream.
==42==Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
==43==If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!

**OLI.**
==44==Nay, come, I prithee. Would thou’dst be rul’d by me!

**SEB.**
==45==Madam, I will.

**OLI.**
==45==        O, say so, and so be!

*Exeunt.*
