## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Illyria. A street.*

*Enter Sebastian and Antonio.*

**SEB.**
I would not by my will have troubled you,
But since you make your pleasure of your pains,
I will no further chide you.

**ANT.**
I could not stay behind you. My desire
(More sharp than filed steel) did spur me forth,
And not all love to see you (though so much
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage) 
But jealousy what might befall your travel,
Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
Unguided and unfriended, often prove
Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,
The rather by these arguments of fear,
Set forth in your pursuit.

**SEB.**
              My kind Antonio,
I can no other answer make but thanks,
And thanks; and ever oft good turns
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay;
But were my worth as is my conscience firm,
You should find better dealing. What’s to do?
Shall we go see the reliques of this town?

**ANT.**
Tomorrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.

**SEB.**
I am not weary, and ’tis long to night;
I pray you let us satisfy our eyes
With the memorials and the things of fame
That do renown this city.

**ANT.**
              Would you’ld pardon me.
I do not without danger walk these streets.
Once in a sea-fight ’gainst the Count his galleys
I did some service, of such note indeed,
That were I ta’en here, it would scarce be answer’d.

**SEB.**
Belike you slew great number of his people?

**ANT.**
Th’ offense is not of such a bloody nature,
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
Might well have given us bloody argument.
It might have since been answer’d in repaying
What we took from them, which for traffic’s sake
Most of our city did. Only myself stood out,
For which if I be lapsed in this place
I shall pay dear.

**SEB.**
        Do not then walk too open.

**ANT.**
It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse.
In the south suburbs at the Elephant
Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet,
Whiles you beguile the time, and feed your knowledge
With viewing of the town. There shall you have me.

**SEB.**
Why I your purse?

**ANT.**
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
You have desire to purchase; and your store
I think is not for idle markets, sir.

**SEB.**
I’ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you
For an hour.

**ANT.**
To th’ Elephant.

**SEB.**
        I do remember.

*Exeunt.*
