## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Illyria. A street.*

*Enter Sebastian and Antonio.*

**SEB.**
==1==I would not by my will have troubled you,
==2==But since you make your pleasure of your pains,
==3==I will no further chide you.

**ANT.**
==4==I could not stay behind you. My desire
==5==(More sharp than filed steel) did spur me forth,
==6==And not all love to see you (though so much
==7==As might have drawn one to a longer voyage) 
==8==But jealousy what might befall your travel,
==9==Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
==10==Unguided and unfriended, often prove
==11==Rough and unhospitable. My willing love,
==12==The rather by these arguments of fear,
==13==Set forth in your pursuit.

**SEB.**
==13==              My kind Antonio,
==14==I can no other answer make but thanks,
==15==And thanks; and ever oft good turns
==16==Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay;
==17==But were my worth as is my conscience firm,
==18==You should find better dealing. What’s to do?
==19==Shall we go see the reliques of this town?

**ANT.**
==20==Tomorrow, sir; best first go see your lodging.

**SEB.**
==21==I am not weary, and ’tis long to night;
==22==I pray you let us satisfy our eyes
==23==With the memorials and the things of fame
==24==That do renown this city.

**ANT.**
==24==              Would you’ld pardon me.
==25==I do not without danger walk these streets.
==26==Once in a sea-fight ’gainst the Count his galleys
==27==I did some service, of such note indeed,
==28==That were I ta’en here, it would scarce be answer’d.

**SEB.**
==29==Belike you slew great number of his people?

**ANT.**
==30==Th’ offense is not of such a bloody nature,
==31==Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
==32==Might well have given us bloody argument.
==33==It might have since been answer’d in repaying
==34==What we took from them, which for traffic’s sake
==35==Most of our city did. Only myself stood out,
==36==For which if I be lapsed in this place
==37==I shall pay dear.

**SEB.**
==37==        Do not then walk too open.

**ANT.**
==38==It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here’s my purse.
==39==In the south suburbs at the Elephant
==40==Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet,
==41==Whiles you beguile the time, and feed your knowledge
==42==With viewing of the town. There shall you have me.

**SEB.**
==43==Why I your purse?

**ANT.**
==44==Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
==45==You have desire to purchase; and your store
==46==I think is not for idle markets, sir.

**SEB.**
==47==I’ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you
==48==For an hour.

**ANT.**
==49==To th’ Elephant.

**SEB.**
==49==        I do remember.

*Exeunt.*
