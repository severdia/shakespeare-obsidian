## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 1, Scene 5|Act 1, Scene 5 →]]

*A room in Duke Orsino’s palace.*

*Enter Valentine, and Viola in man’s attire.*

**VAL.**
==1== If the Duke continue these favors towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanc’d; he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.

**VIO.**
==2== You either fear his humor or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favors?

**VAL.**
==3== No, believe me.

*Enter Duke, Curio, and Attendants.*

**VIO.**
==4== I thank you. Here comes the Count.

**DUKE.**
==5== Who saw Cesario, ho?

**VIO.**
==6== On your attendance, my lord, here.

**DUKE.**
==7== Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario,
==8== Thou know’st no less but all. I have unclasp’d
==9== To thee the book even of my secret soul.
==10== Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her,
==11== Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
==12== And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
==13== Till thou have audience.

**VIO.**
==13==               Sure, my noble lord,
==14== If she be so abandon’d to her sorrow
==15== As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

**DUKE.**
==16== Be clamorous, and leap all civil bounds,
==17== Rather than make unprofited return.

**VIO.**
==18== Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

**DUKE.**
==19== O then, unfold the passion of my love,
==20== Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith;
==21== It shall become thee well to act my woes:
==22== She will attend it better in thy youth
==23== Than in a nuntio’s of more grave aspect.

**VIO.**
==24== I think not so, my lord.

**DUKE.**
==24==               Dear lad, believe it;
==25== For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
==26== That say thou art a man. Diana’s lip
==27== Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
==28== Is as the maiden’s organ, shrill and sound,
==29== And all is semblative a woman’s part.
==30== I know thy constellation is right apt
==31== For this affair. Some four or five attend him⁠—
==32== All, if you will; for I myself am best
==33== When least in company. Prosper well in this,
==34== And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
==35== To call his fortunes thine.

**VIO.**
==35==               I’ll do my best
==36== To woo your lady.
*(Aside.)*
==36==            Yet a barful strife!
==37== Whoe’er I woo, myself would be his wife.

*Exeunt.*
