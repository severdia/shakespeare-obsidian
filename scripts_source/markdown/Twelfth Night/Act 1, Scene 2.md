## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*The sea coast.*

*Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors.*

**VIO.**
What country, friends, is this?

**CAP.**
This is Illyria, lady.

**VIO.**
And what should I do in Illyria?
My brother he is in Elysium.
Perchance he is not drown’d—what think you, sailors?

**CAP.**
It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

**VIO.**
O my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.

**CAP.**
True, madam, and to comfort you with chance,
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
When you, and those poor number saved with you,
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
Most provident in peril, bind himself
(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice) 
To a strong mast that liv’d upon the sea;
Where like Arion on the dolphin’s back,
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
So long as I could see.

**VIO.**
For saying so, there’s gold.
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
The like of him. Know’st thou this country?

**CAP.**
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born
Not three hours’ travel from this very place.

**VIO.**
Who governs here?

**CAP.**
A noble duke, in nature as in name.

**VIO.**
What is his name?

**CAP.**
Orsino.

**VIO.**
Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.

**CAP.**
And so is now, or was so very late;
For but a month ago I went from hence,
And then ’twas fresh in murmur (as you know
What great ones do, the less will prattle of) 
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

**VIO.**
What’s she?

**CAP.**
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
In the protection of his son, her brother,
Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,
They say, she hath abjur’d the company
And sight of men.

**VIO.**
           O that I serv’d that lady,
And might not be delivered to the world
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow
What my estate is!

**CAP.**
           That were hard to compass,
Because she will admit no kind of suit,
No, not the Duke’s.

**VIO.**
There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,
And though that nature with a beauteous wall
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
With this thy fair and outward character.
I prithee (and I’ll pay thee bounteously) 
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
For such disguise as haply shall become
The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke;
Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him,
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
And speak to him in many sorts of music
That will allow me very worth his service.
What else may hap, to time I will commit,
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

**CAP.**
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be;
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

**VIO.**
I thank thee. Lead me on.

*Exeunt.*
