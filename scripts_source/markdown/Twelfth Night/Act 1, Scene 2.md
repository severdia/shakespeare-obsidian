## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*The sea coast.*

*Enter Viola, a Captain, and Sailors.*

**VIO.**
==1==What country, friends, is this?

**CAP.**
==2==This is Illyria, lady.

**VIO.**
==3==And what should I do in Illyria?
==4==My brother he is in Elysium.
==5==Perchance he is not drown’d—what think you, sailors?

**CAP.**
==6==It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

**VIO.**
==7==O my poor brother! And so perchance may he be.

**CAP.**
==8==True, madam, and to comfort you with chance,
==9==Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
==10==When you, and those poor number saved with you,
==11==Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
==12==Most provident in peril, bind himself
==13==(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice) 
==14==To a strong mast that liv’d upon the sea;
==15==Where like Arion on the dolphin’s back,
==16==I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
==17==So long as I could see.

**VIO.**
==18==For saying so, there’s gold.
==19==Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
==20==Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
==21==The like of him. Know’st thou this country?

**CAP.**
==22==Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born
==23==Not three hours’ travel from this very place.

**VIO.**
==24==Who governs here?

**CAP.**
==25==A noble duke, in nature as in name.

**VIO.**
==26==What is his name?

**CAP.**
==27==Orsino.

**VIO.**
==28==Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then.

**CAP.**
==29==And so is now, or was so very late;
==30==For but a month ago I went from hence,
==31==And then ’twas fresh in murmur (as you know
==32==What great ones do, the less will prattle of) 
==33==That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

**VIO.**
==34==What’s she?

**CAP.**
==35==A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
==36==That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
==37==In the protection of his son, her brother,
==38==Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,
==39==They say, she hath abjur’d the company
==40==And sight of men.

**VIO.**
==40==           O that I serv’d that lady,
==41==And might not be delivered to the world
==42==Till I had made mine own occasion mellow
==43==What my estate is!

**CAP.**
==43==           That were hard to compass,
==44==Because she will admit no kind of suit,
==45==No, not the Duke’s.

**VIO.**
==46==There is a fair behavior in thee, captain,
==47==And though that nature with a beauteous wall
==48==Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
==49==I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
==50==With this thy fair and outward character.
==51==I prithee (and I’ll pay thee bounteously) 
==52==Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
==53==For such disguise as haply shall become
==54==The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke;
==55==Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him,
==56==It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
==57==And speak to him in many sorts of music
==58==That will allow me very worth his service.
==59==What else may hap, to time I will commit,
==60==Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

**CAP.**
==61==Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be;
==62==When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

**VIO.**
==63==I thank thee. Lead me on.

*Exeunt.*
