## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*A room in Olivia’s house.*

*Enter Sir Toby Belch and Maria.*

**SIR TO.**
What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life.

**MAR.**
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier a’ nights. Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.

**SIR TO.**
Why, let her except before excepted.

**MAR.**
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.

**SIR TO.**
Confine? I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.

**MAR.**
That quaffing and drinking will undo you. I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.

**SIR TO.**
Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?

**MAR.**
Ay, he.

**SIR TO.**
He’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.

**MAR.**
What’s that to th’ purpose?

**SIR TO.**
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.

**MAR.**
Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats. He’s a very fool and a prodigal.

**SIR TO.**
Fie, that you’ll say so! He plays o’ th’ viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.

**MAR.**
He hath indeed, almost natural; for besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreler; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling, ’tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.

**SIR TO.**
By this hand, they are scoundrels and sub-stractors that say so of him. Who are they?

**MAR.**
They that add moreov’r, he’s drunk nightly in your company.

**SIR TO.**
With drinking healths to my niece. I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He’s a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ th’ toe like a parish-top. What, wench! *Castiliano vulgo!* For here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.

*Enter Sir Andrew Aguecheek.*

**SIR AND.**
Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?

**SIR TO.**
Sweet Sir Andrew!

**SIR AND.**
Bless you, fair shrew.

**MAR.**
And you too, sir.

**SIR TO.**
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.

**SIR AND.**
What’s that?

**SIR TO.**
My niece’s chambermaid.

**SIR AND.**
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.

**MAR.**
My name is Mary, sir.

**SIR AND.**
Good Mistress Mary Accost⁠—

**SIR TO.**
You mistake, knight. “Accost” is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.

**SIR AND.**
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of “accost”?

**MAR.**
Fare you well, gentlemen.

**SIR TO.**
And thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.

**SIR AND.**
And you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?

**MAR.**
Sir, I have not you by th’ hand.

**SIR AND.**
Marry, but you shall have—and here’s my hand.

**MAR.**
Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you bring your hand to th’ butt’ry-bar, and let it drink.

**SIR AND.**
Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?

**MAR.**
It’s dry, sir.

**SIR AND.**
Why, I think so. I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?

**MAR.**
A dry jest, sir.

**SIR AND.**
Are you full of them?

**MAR.**
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends. Marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.

*Exit Maria.*

**SIR TO.**
O knight, thou lack’st a cup of canary. When did I see thee so put down?

**SIR AND.**
Never in your life I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.

**SIR TO.**
No question.

**SIR AND.**
And I thought that, I’d forswear it. I’ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby.

**SIR TO.**
*Pourquoi*, my dear knight?

**SIR AND.**
What is *“pourquoi”*? Do, or not do? I would I had bestow’d that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O had I but follow’d the arts!

**SIR TO.**
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.

**SIR AND.**
Why, would that have mended my hair?

**SIR TO.**
Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature.

**SIR AND.**
But it becomes me well enough, does’t not?

**SIR TO.**
Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off.

**SIR AND.**
Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me. The Count himself here hard by woos her.

**SIR TO.**
She’ll none o’ th’ Count. She’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life in’t, man.

**SIR AND.**
I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ th’ strangest mind i’ th’ world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.

**SIR TO.**
Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?

**SIR AND.**
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters, and yet I will not compare with an old man.

**SIR TO.**
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?

**SIR AND.**
Faith, I can cut a caper.

**SIR TO.**
And I can cut the mutton to’t.

**SIR AND.**
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.

**SIR TO.**
Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before ’em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig.
I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form’d under the star of a galliard.

**SIR AND.**
Ay, ’tis strong; and it does indifferent well in a dun-color’d stock. Shall we set about some revels?

**SIR TO.**
What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?

**SIR AND.**
Taurus? That’s sides and heart.

**SIR TO.**
No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher! Ha, ha, excellent!

*Exeunt.*
