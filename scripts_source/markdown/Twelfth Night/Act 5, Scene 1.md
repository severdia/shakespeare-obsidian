## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]]

*A street before Olivia’s house.*

*Enter Clown and Fabian.*

**FAB.**
==1==Now as thou lov’st me, let me see his letter.

**CLO.**
==2==Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.

**FAB.**
==3==Any thing.

**CLO.**
==4==Do not desire to see this letter.

**FAB.**
==5==This is to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again.

*Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and Lords.*

**DUKE.**
==6==Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?

**CLO.**
==7==Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings.

**DUKE.**
==8==I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?

**CLO.**
==9==Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.

**DUKE.**
==10==Just the contrary: the better for thy friends.

**CLO.**
==11==No, sir, the worse.

**DUKE.**
==12==How can that be?

**CLO.**
==13==Marry, sir, they praise me, and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass; so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abus’d; so that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives, why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes.

**DUKE.**
==14==Why, this is excellent.

**CLO.**
==15==By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends.

**DUKE.**
==16==Thou shalt not be the worse for me, there’s gold.

**CLO.**
==17==But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another.

**DUKE.**
==18==O, you give me ill counsel.

**CLO.**
==19==Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.

**DUKE.**
==20==Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double-dealer. There’s another.

**CLO.**
==21==*Primo, secundo, tertio*, is a good play, and the old saying is, the third pays for all. The triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure, or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind—one, two, three.

**DUKE.**
==22==You can fool no more money out of me at this throw. If you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.

**CLO.**
==23==Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir, but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness; but as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon.

*Exit.*

*Enter Antonio and Officers.*

**VIO.**
==24==Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.

**DUKE.**
==25==That face of his I do remember well,
==26==Yet when I saw it last, it was besmear’d
==27==As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war.
==28==A baubling vessel was he captain of,
==29==For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,
==30==With which such scathful grapple did he make
==31==With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
==32==That very envy, and the tongue of loss,
==33==Cried fame and honor on him. What’s the matter?

**1. OFF.**
==34==Orsino, this is that Antonio
==35==That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy,
==36==And this is he that did the Tiger board,
==37==When your young nephew Titus lost his leg.
==38==Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
==39==In private brabble did we apprehend him.

**VIO.**
==40==He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side,
==41==But in conclusion put strange speech upon me.
==42==I know not what ’twas but distraction.

**DUKE.**
==43==Notable pirate, thou salt-water thief!
==44==What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies
==45==Whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear
==46==Hast made thine enemies?

**ANT.**
==46==              Orsino, noble sir,
==47==Be pleas’d that I shake off these names you give me.
==48==Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
==49==Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
==50==Orsino’s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
==51==That most ingrateful boy there by your side
==52==From the rude sea’s enrag’d and foamy mouth
==53==Did I redeem; a wrack past hope he was.
==54==His life I gave him, and did thereto add
==55==My love, without retention or restraint,
==56==All his in dedication. For his sake
==57==Did I expose myself (pure for his love) 
==58==Into the danger of this adverse town,
==59==Drew to defend him when he was beset;
==60==Where being apprehended, his false cunning
==61==(Not meaning to partake with me in danger) 
==62==Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
==63==And grew a twenty years removed thing
==64==While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
==65==Which I had recommended to his use
==66==Not half an hour before.

**VIO.**
==66==              How can this be?

**DUKE.**
==67==When came he to this town?

**ANT.**
==68==Today, my lord; and for three months before,
==69==No int’rim, not a minute’s vacancy,
==70==Both day and night did we keep company.

*Enter Olivia and Attendants.*

**DUKE.**
==71==Here comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth.
==72==But for thee, fellow—fellow, thy words are madness.
==73==Three months this youth hath tended upon me,
==74==But more of that anon. Take him aside.

**OLI.**
==75==What would my lord, but that he may not have,
==76==Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
==77==Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.

**VIO.**
==78==Madam⁠—

**DUKE.**
==79==Gracious Olivia⁠—

**OLI.**
==80==What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord⁠—

**VIO.**
==81==My lord would speak, my duty hushes me.

**OLI.**
==82==If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
==83==It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
==84==As howling after music.

**DUKE.**
==84==              Still so cruel?

**OLI.**
==85==Still so constant, lord.

**DUKE.**
==86==What, to perverseness? You uncivil lady,
==87==To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
==88==My soul the faithfull’st off’rings have breath’d out
==89==That e’er devotion tender’d! What shall I do?

**OLI.**
==90==Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.

**DUKE.**
==91==Why should I not (had I the heart to do it),
==92==Like to th’ Egyptian thief at point of death,
==93==Kill what I love? (a savage jealousy
==94==That sometime savors nobly), but hear me this:
==95==Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
==96==And that I partly know the instrument
==97==That screws me from my true place in your favor,
==98==Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still.
==99==But this your minion, whom I know you love,
==100==And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
==101==Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
==102==Where he sits crowned in his master’s spite.
==103==Come, boy, with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischief.
==104==I’ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
==105==To spite a raven’s heart within a dove.

**VIO.**
==106==And I most jocund, apt, and willingly,
==107==To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.

**OLI.**
==108==Where goes Cesario?

**VIO.**
==108==              After him I love
==109==More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
==110==More by all mores than e’er I shall love wife.
==111==If I do feign, you witnesses above
==112==Punish my life for tainting of my love!

**OLI.**
==113==Ay me, detested! How am I beguil’d!

**VIO.**
==114==Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong?

**OLI.**
==115==Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long?
==116==Call forth the holy father.

**DUKE.**
==116==              Come, away!

**OLI.**
==117==Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.

**DUKE.**
==118==Husband?

**OLI.**
==118==    Ay, husband. Can he that deny?

**DUKE.**
==119==Her husband, sirrah?

**VIO.**
==119==           No, my lord, not I.

**OLI.**
==120==Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
==121==That makes thee strangle thy propriety.
==122==Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up,
==123==Be that thou know’st thou art, and then thou art
==124==As great as that thou fear’st.
*(Enter Priest.)*
==124==                O, welcome, father!
==125==Father, I charge thee by thy reverence
==126==Here to unfold, though lately we intended
==127==To keep in darkness what occasion now
==128==Reveals before ’tis ripe, what thou dost know
==129==Hath newly pass’d between this youth and me.

**PRIEST.**
==130==A contract of eternal bond of love,
==131==Confirm’d by mutual joinder of your hands,
==132==Attested by the holy close of lips,
==133==Strength’ned by interchangement of your rings,
==134==And all the ceremony of this compact
==135==Seal’d in my function, by my testimony;
==136==Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
==137==I have travel’d but two hours.

**DUKE.**
==138==O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be
==139==When time hath sow’d a grizzle on thy case?
==140==Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
==141==That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
==142==Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feet
==143==Where thou and I (henceforth) may never meet.

**VIO.**
==144==My lord, I do protest⁠—

**OLI.**
==144==           O, do not swear!
==145==Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.

*Enter Sir Andrew.*

**SIR AND.**
==146==For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby.

**OLI.**
==147==What’s the matter?

**SIR AND.**
==148==H’as broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.

**OLI.**
==149==Who has done this, Sir Andrew?

**SIR AND.**
==150==The Count’s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he’s the very devil incardinate.

**DUKE.**
==151==My gentleman, Cesario?

**SIR AND.**
==152==’Od’s lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do’t by Sir Toby.

**VIO.**
==153==Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you.
==154==You drew your sword upon me without cause,
==155==But I bespake you fair, and hurt you not.

*Enter Toby and Clown.*

**SIR AND.**
==156==If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting—you shall hear more. But if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you othergates than he did.

**DUKE.**
==157==How now, gentleman? How is’t with you?

**SIR TO.**
==158==That’s all one. H’as hurt me, and there’s th’ end on’t. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?

**CLO.**
==159==O, he’s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes were set at eight i’ th’ morning.

**SIR TO.**
==160==Then he’s a rogue, and a passy-measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue.

**OLI.**
==161==Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?

**SIR AND.**
==162==I’ll help you, Sir Toby, because we’ll be dress’d together.

**SIR TO.**
==163==Will you help?—an ass-head and a coxcomb and a knave, a thin-fac’d knave, a gull!

**OLI.**
==164==Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look’d to.

*Exeunt Clown, Fabian, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew.*

*Enter Sebastian.*

**SEB.**
==165==I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman,
==166==But had it been the brother of my blood,
==167==I must have done no less with wit and safety.
==168==You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
==169==I do perceive it hath offended you.
==170==Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
==171==We made each other but so late ago.

**DUKE.**
==172==One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
==173==A natural perspective, that is and is not!

**SEB.**
==174==Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
==175==How have the hours rack’d and tortur’d me,
==176==Since I have lost thee!

**ANT.**
==177==Sebastian are you?

**SEB.**
==177==           Fear’st thou that, Antonio?

**ANT.**
==178==How have you made division of yourself?
==179==An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
==180==Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?

**OLI.**
==181==Most wonderful!

**SEB.**
==182==Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
==183==Nor can there be that deity in my nature
==184==Of here and every where. I had a sister,
==185==Whom the blind waves and surges have devour’d.
==186==Of charity, what kin are you to me?
==187==What countryman? What name? What parentage?

**VIO.**
==188==Of Messaline; Sebastian was my father,
==189==Such a Sebastian was my brother too;
==190==So went he suited to his watery tomb.
==191==If spirits can assume both form and suit,
==192==You come to fright us.

**SEB.**
==192==              A spirit I am indeed,
==193==But am in that dimension grossly clad
==194==Which from the womb I did participate.
==195==Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
==196==I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
==197==And say, “Thrice welcome, drowned Viola!”

**VIO.**
==198==My father had a mole upon his brow.

**SEB.**
==199==And so had mine.

**VIO.**
==200==And died that day when Viola from her birth
==201==Had numb’red thirteen years.

**SEB.**
==202==O, that record is lively in my soul!
==203==He finished indeed his mortal act
==204==That day that made my sister thirteen years.

**VIO.**
==205==If nothing lets to make us happy both
==206==But this my masculine usurp’d attire,
==207==Do not embrace me till each circumstance
==208==Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
==209==That I am Viola—which to confirm,
==210==I’ll bring you to a captain in this town,
==211==Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
==212==I was preserv’d to serve this noble count.
==213==All the occurrence of my fortune since
==214==Hath been between this lady and this lord.

**SEB.**
*(To Olivia.)*
==215==So comes it, lady, you have been mistook;
==216==But Nature to her bias drew in that.
==217==You would have been contracted to a maid,
==218==Nor are you therein, by my life, deceiv’d,
==219==You are betroth’d both to a maid and man.

**DUKE.**
==220==Be not amaz’d, right noble is his blood.
==221==If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
==222==I shall have share in this most happy wrack.
*(To Viola.)*
==223==Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
==224==Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.

**VIO.**
==225==And all those sayings will I over swear,
==226==And all those swearings keep as true in soul
==227==As doth that orbed continent the fire
==228==That severs day from night.

**DUKE.**
==228==              Give me thy hand,
==229==And let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds.

**VIO.**
==230==The captain that did bring me first on shore
==231==Hath my maid’s garments. He upon some action
==232==Is now in durance, at Malvolio’s suit,
==233==A gentleman, and follower of my lady’s.

**OLI.**
==234==He shall enlarge him; fetch Malvolio hither.
==235==And yet, alas, now I remember me,
==236==They say, poor gentleman, he’s much distract.
*(Enter Clown with a letter, and Fabian.)*
==237==A most extracting frenzy of mine own
==238==From my remembrance clearly banish’d his.
==239==How does he, sirrah?

**CLO.**
==240==Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the stave’s end as well as a man in his case may do. H’as here writ a letter to you; I should have given’t you today morning. But as a madman’s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are deliver’d.

**OLI.**
==241==Open’t and read it.

**CLO.**
==242==Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman.
*(Reads madly.)*
==243==*“By the Lord, madam”—*

**OLI.**
==244==How now, art thou mad?

**CLO.**
==245==No, madam, I do but read madness. And your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow *vox*.

**OLI.**
==246==Prithee read i’ thy right wits.

**CLO.**
==247==So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to read thus; therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.

**OLI.**
*(To Fabian.)*
==248==Read it you, sirrah.

**FAB.**
*(Reads.)*
==249==*“By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness, and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induc’d me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right, or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of, and speak out of my injury.*
==250==*The madly-us’d Malvolio.”*

**OLI.**
==251==Did he write this?

**CLO.**
==252==Ay, madam.

**DUKE.**
==253==This savors not much of distraction.

**OLI.**
==254==See him deliver’d, Fabian, bring him hither.
*(Exit Fabian.)*
==255==My lord, so please you, these things further thought on,
==256==To think me as well a sister as a wife,
==257==One day shall crown th’ alliance on’t, so please you,
==258==Here at my house and at my proper cost.

**DUKE.**
==259==Madam, I am most apt t’ embrace your offer.
*(To Viola.)*
==260==Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
==261==So much against the mettle of your sex,
==262==So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
==263==And since you call’d me master for so long,
==264==Here is my hand—you shall from this time be
==265==Your master’s mistress.

**OLI.**
==265==              A sister! You are she.

*Enter Fabian with Malvolio.*

**DUKE.**
==266==Is this the madman?

**OLI.**
==266==           Ay, my lord, this same.
==267==How now, Malvolio?

**MAL.**
==267==           Madam, you have done me wrong,
==268==Notorious wrong.

**OLI.**
==268==           Have I, Malvolio? No.

**MAL.**
==269==Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.
==270==You must not now deny it is your hand;
==271==Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase,
==272==Or say ’tis not your seal, not your invention.
==273==You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,
==274==And tell me, in the modesty of honor,
==275==Why you have given me such clear lights of favor,
==276==Bade me come smiling and cross-garter’d to you,
==277==To put on yellow stockings, and to frown
==278==Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
==279==And acting this in an obedient hope,
==280==Why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,
==281==Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
==282==And made the most notorious geck and gull
==283==That e’er invention play’d on? Tell me why!

**OLI.**
==284==Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
==285==Though I confess much like the character;
==286==But out of question ’tis Maria’s hand.
==287==And now I do bethink me, it was she
==288==First told me thou wast mad. Then cam’st in smiling,
==289==And in such forms which here were presuppos’d
==290==Upon thee in the letter. Prithee be content.
==291==This practice hath most shrewdly pass’d upon thee;
==292==But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
==293==Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
==294==Of thine own cause.

**FAB.**
==294==           Good madam, hear me speak,
==295==And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
==296==Taint the condition of this present hour,
==297==Which I have wond’red at. In hope it shall not,
==298==Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
==299==Set this device against Malvolio here,
==300==Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
==301==We had conceiv’d against him. Maria writ
==302==The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance,
==303==In recompense whereof he hath married her.
==304==How with a sportful malice it was follow’d
==305==May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,
==306==If that the injuries be justly weigh’d
==307==That have on both sides pass’d.

**OLI.**
==308==Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!

**CLO.**
==309==Why, “some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.” I was one, sir, in this enterlude—one Sir Topas, sir, but that’s all one. “By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.” But do you remember? “Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? And you smile not, he’s gagg’d.” And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.

**MAL.**
==310==I’ll be reveng’d on the whole pack of you.

*Exit.*

**OLI.**
==311==He hath been most notoriously abus’d.

**DUKE.**
==312==Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace;
==313==He hath not told us of the captain yet.
==314==When that is known, and golden time convents,
==315==A solemn combination shall be made
==316==Of our dear souls. Mean time, sweet sister,
==317==We will not part from hence. Cesario, come⁠—
==318==For so you shall be while you are a man;
==319==But when in other habits you are seen,
==320==Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen.

*Exeunt all but Clown.*

**CLO.**
*(Clown sings.)*
==321== *When that I was and a little tiny boy,*
==322==    *With hey ho, the wind and the rain,*
==323== *A foolish thing was but a toy,*
==324==    *For the rain it raineth every day.*
==325== *But when I came to man’s estate,*
==326==    *With hey ho, the wind and the rain,*
==327== *’Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,*
==328==    *For the rain it raineth every day.*
==329== *But when I came, alas, to wive,*
==330==    *With hey ho, the wind and the rain,*
==331== *By swaggering could I never thrive,*
==332==    *For the rain it raineth every day.*
==333== *But when I came unto my beds,*
==334==    *With hey ho, the wind and the rain,*
==335== *With toss-pots still had drunken heads,*
==336==    *For the rain it raineth every day.*
==337== *A great while ago the world begun,*
==338==    *With hey ho, the wind and the rain,*
==339== *But that’s all one, our play is done,*
==340==    *And we’ll strive to please you every day.*

*Exit.*
