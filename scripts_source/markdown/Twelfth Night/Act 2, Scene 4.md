## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*A room in Duke Orsino’s palace.*

*Enter Duke, Viola, Curio, and others.*

**DUKE.**
==1==Give me some music. Now good morrow, friends.
==2==Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
==3==That old and antique song we heard last night;
==4==Methought it did relieve my passion much,
==5==More than light airs and recollected terms
==6==Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.
==7==Come, but one verse.

**CUR.**
==8==He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it.

**DUKE.**
==9==Who was it?

**CUR.**
==10==Feste the jester, my lord, a fool that the Lady Olivia’s father took much delight in. He is about the house.

**DUKE.**
==11==Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
*(Exit Curio.)*
*(Music plays.)*
==12==Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love,
==13==In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
==14==For such as I am, all true lovers are,
==15==Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
==16==Save in the constant image of the creature
==17==That is belov’d. How dost thou like this tune?

**VIO.**
==18==It gives a very echo to the seat
==19==Where Love is thron’d.

**DUKE.**
==19==           Thou dost speak masterly.
==20==My life upon’t, young though thou art, thine eye
==21==Hath stay’d upon some favor that it loves.
==22==Hath it not, boy?

**VIO.**
==22==           A little, by your favor.

**DUKE.**
==23==What kind of woman is’t?

**VIO.**
==23==              Of your complexion.

**DUKE.**
==24==She is not worth thee then. What years, i’faith?

**VIO.**
==25==About your years, my lord.

**DUKE.**
==26==Too old, by heaven. Let still the woman take
==27==An elder than herself, so wears she to him;
==28==So sways she level in her husband’s heart.
==29==For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
==30==Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
==31==More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
==32==Than women’s are.

**VIO.**
==32==           I think it well, my lord.

**DUKE.**
==33==Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
==34==Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
==35==For women are as roses, whose fair flow’r
==36==Being once display’d, doth fall that very hour.

**VIO.**
==37==And so they are; alas, that they are so!
==38==To die, even when they to perfection grow!

*Enter Curio and Clown.*

**DUKE.**
==39==O fellow, come, the song we had last night.
==40==Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain.
==41==The spinsters and the knitters in the sun,
==42==And the free maids that weave their thread with bones,
==43==Do use to chaunt it. It is silly sooth,
==44==And dallies with the innocence of love,
==45==Like the old age.

**CLO.**
==46==Are you ready, sir?

**DUKE.**
==47==Ay, prithee sing.

*Music. The Song*

**CLO.**
==48== *Come away, come away, death,*
==49== *And in sad cypress let me be laid.*
==50== *Fly away, fly away, breath,*
==51== *I am slain by a fair cruel maid.*
==52== *My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,*
==53== *O, prepare it!*
==54== *My part of death, no one so true*
==55== *Did share it.*
==56== *Not a flower, not a flower sweet*
==57== *On my black coffin let there be strown.*
==58== *Not a friend, not a friend greet*
==59== *My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown.*
==60== *A thousand thousand sighs to save,*
==61== *Lay me, O, where*
==62== *Sad true lover never find my grave,*
==63== *To weep there.*

**DUKE.**
==64==There’s for thy pains.

**CLO.**
==65==No pains, sir, I take pleasure in singing, sir.

**DUKE.**
==66==I’ll pay thy pleasure then.

**CLO.**
==67==Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.

**DUKE.**
==68==Give me now leave to leave thee.

**CLO.**
==69==Now the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be every thing and their intent every where, for that’s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.

*Exit.*

**DUKE.**
==70==Let all the rest give place.
*(Curio and Attendants retire.)*
==71==Once more, Cesario,
==72==Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty,
==73==Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
==74==Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
==75==The parts that fortune hath bestow’d upon her,
==76==Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
==77==But ’tis that miracle and queen of gems
==78==That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.

**VIO.**
==79==But if she cannot love you, sir?

**DUKE.**
==80==I cannot be so answer’d.

**VIO.**
==80==              Sooth, but you must.
==81==Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
==82==Hath for your love as great a pang of heart
==83==As you have for Olivia. You cannot love her;
==84==You tell her so. Must she not then be answer’d?

**DUKE.**
==85==There is no woman’s sides
==86==Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
==87==As love doth give my heart; no woman’s heart
==88==So big, to hold so much; they lack retention.
==89==Alas, their love may be call’d appetite,
==90==No motion of the liver, but the palate,
==91==That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt,
==92==But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
==93==And can digest as much. Make no compare
==94==Between that love a woman can bear me
==95==And that I owe Olivia.

**VIO.**
==95==           Ay, but I know⁠—

**DUKE.**
==96==What dost thou know?

**VIO.**
==97==Too well what love women to men may owe;
==98==In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
==99==My father had a daughter lov’d a man
==100==As it might be perhaps, were I a woman,
==101==I should your lordship.

**DUKE.**
==101==           And what’s her history?

**VIO.**
==102==A blank, my lord; she never told her love,
==103==But let concealment like a worm i’ th’ bud
==104==Feed on her damask cheek; she pin’d in thought,
==105==And with a green and yellow melancholy
==106==She sate like Patience on a monument,
==107==Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
==108==We men may say more, swear more, but indeed
==109==Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
==110==Much in our vows, but little in our love.

**DUKE.**
==111==But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

**VIO.**
==112==I am all the daughters of my father’s house,
==113==And all the brothers too—and yet I know not.
==114==Sir, shall I to this lady?

**DUKE.**
==114==              Ay, that’s the theme,
==115==To her in haste; give her this jewel; say
==116==My love can give no place, bide no denay.

*Exeunt.*
