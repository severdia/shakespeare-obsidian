## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A room in Olivia’s house.*

*Enter Maria and Clown.*

**MAR.**
Nay, I prithee put on this gown and this beard, make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate, do it quickly. I’ll call Sir Toby the whilst.

*Exit.*

**CLO.**
Well, I’ll put it on, and I will dissemble myself in’t, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor lean enough to be thought a good student; but to be said an honest man and a good house-keeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.

*Enter Toby and Maria.*

**SIR TO.**
Jove bless thee, Master Parson.

**CLO.**
*Bonos dies*, Sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, “That that is is”; so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for what is “that” but “that,” and “is” but “is”?

**SIR TO.**
To him, Sir Topas.

**CLO.**
What ho, I say! Peace in this prison!

**SIR TO.**
The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.

**MAL.**
*(Within.)*
Who calls there?

**CLO.**
Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic.

**MAL.**
Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.

**CLO.**
Out, hyperbolical fiend! How vexest thou this man! Talkest thou nothing but of ladies?

**SIR TO.**
Well said, Master Parson.

**MAL.**
Sir Topas, never was man thus wrong’d. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad; they have laid me here in hideous darkness.

**CLO.**
Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Say’st thou that house is dark?

**MAL.**
As hell, Sir Topas.

**CLO.**
Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of obstruction?

**MAL.**
I am not mad, Sir Topas, I say to you this house is dark.

**CLO.**
Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.

**MAL.**
I say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say there was never man thus abus’d. I am no more mad than you are; make the trial of it in any constant question.

**CLO.**
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild-fowl?

**MAL.**
That the soul of our grandam might happily inhabit a bird.

**CLO.**
What think’st thou of his opinion?

**MAL.**
I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.

**CLO.**
Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold th’ opinion of Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.

**MAL.**
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!

**SIR TO.**
My most exquisite Sir Topas!

**CLO.**
Nay, I am for all waters.

**MAR.**
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown, he sees thee not.

**SIR TO.**
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find’st him. I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently deliver’d, I would he were, for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport t’ the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.

*Exit with Maria.*

**CLO.**
*(Sings.)*
*“Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,*
*Tell me how thy lady does.”*

**MAL.**
Fool!

**CLO.**
*“My lady is unkind, perdie.”*

**MAL.**
Fool!

**CLO.**
*“Alas, why is she so?”*

**MAL.**
Fool, I say!

**CLO.**
*“She loves another”⁠—*
Who calls, ha?

**MAL.**
Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink, and paper. As I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for’t.

**CLO.**
Master Malvolio?

**MAL.**
Ay, good fool.

**CLO.**
Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?

**MAL.**
Fool, there was never man so notoriously abus’d; I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.

**CLO.**
But as well! Then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.

**MAL.**
They have here propertied me, keep me in darkness, send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to face me out of my wits.

**CLO.**
Advise you what you say; the minister is here.—Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore! Endeavor thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble babble.

**MAL.**
Sir Topas!

**CLO.**
Maintain no words with him, good fellow.—Who, I, sir? Not I, sir. God buy you, good Sir Topas.—Marry, amen.—I will, sir, I will.

**MAL.**
Fool, fool, fool, I say!

**CLO.**
Alas, sir, be patient. What say you, sir? I am shent for speaking to you.

**MAL.**
Good fool, help me to some light and some paper. I tell thee I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.

**CLO.**
Well-a-day that you were, sir!

**MAL.**
By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light; and convey what I will set down to my lady. It shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.

**CLO.**
I will help you to’t. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed, or do you but counterfeit?

**MAL.**
Believe me I am not, I tell thee true.

**CLO.**
Nay, I’ll ne’er believe a madman till I see his brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.

**MAL.**
Fool, I’ll requite it in the highest degree. I prithee be gone.

**CLO.**
*(Sings.)*
*I am gone, sir,*
*And anon, sir,*
*I’ll be with you again;*
*In a trice,*
*Like to the old Vice,*
*Your need to sustain;*
*Who with dagger of lath,*
*In his rage and his wrath,*
*Cries, ah, ha! To the devil;*
*Like a mad lad,*
*Pare thy nails, dad.*
**Adieu*, goodman devil.*

*Exit.*
