## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*London. The Parliament House.*

*Alarum. Enter Richard Plantagenet, the Duke of York, Edward, Richard, Norfolk, Montague, Warwick, with Drum and Soldiers, with white roses in their hats.*

**WAR.**
==1==I wonder how the King escap’d our hands.

**YORK.**
==2==While we pursu’d the horsemen of the north,
==3==He slyly stole away and left his men;
==4==Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
==5==Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
==6==Cheer’d up the drooping army, and himself,
==7==Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
==8==Charg’d our main battle’s front; and breaking in,
==9==Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.

**EDW.**
==10==Lord Stafford’s father, Duke of Buckingham,
==11==Is either slain or wounded dangerous;
==12==I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.
==13==That this is true, father, behold his blood.

**MONT.**
==14==And, brother, here’s the Earl of Wiltshire’s blood,
==15==Whom I encount’red as the battles join’d.

**RICH.**
==16==Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.

*Showing the Duke of Somerset’s head.*

**YORK.**
==17==Richard hath best deserv’d of all my sons.
==18==But is your Grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?

**NORF.**
==19==Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!

**RICH.**
==20==Thus do I hope to shake King Henry’s head.

**WAR.**
==21==And so do I, victorious prince of York.
==22==Before I see thee seated in that throne
==23==Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
==24==I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
==25==This is the palace of the fearful king,
==26==And this the regal seat. Possess it, York,
==27==For this is thine and not King Henry’s heirs’.

**YORK.**
==28==Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will,
==29==For hither we have broken in by force.

**NORF.**
==30==We’ll all assist you; he that flies shall die.

**YORK.**
==31==Thanks, gentle Norfolk. Stay by me, my lords,
==32==And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.

*They go up.*

**WAR.**
==33==And when the King comes, offer him no violence,
==34==Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.

**YORK.**
==35==The Queen this day here holds her parliament,
==36==But little thinks we shall be of her council.
==37==By words or blows here let us win our right.

**RICH.**
==38==Arm’d as we are, let’s stay within this house.

**WAR.**
==39==The bloody parliament shall this be call’d,
==40==Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
==41==And bashful Henry depos’d, whose cowardice
==42==Hath made us by-words to our enemies.

**YORK.**
==43==Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute,
==44==I mean to take possession of my right.

**WAR.**
==45==Neither the King, nor he that loves him best,
==46==The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
==47==Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells.
==48==I’ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares.
==49==Resolve thee, Richard, claim the English crown.

*York takes the throne.*

*Flourish. Enter King Henry, Clifford, Northumberland, Westmorland, Exeter, and the rest, with red roses in their hats.*

**KING.**
==50==My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
==51==Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,
==52==Back’d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
==53==To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
==54==Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,
==55==And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow’d revenge
==56==On him, his sons, his favorites, and his friends.

**NORTH.**
==57==If I be not, heavens be reveng’d on me!

**CLIF.**
==58==The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.

**WEST.**
==59==What, shall we suffer this? Let’s pluck him down.
==60==My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it.

**KING.**
==61==Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland.

**CLIF.**
==62==Patience is for poltroons, such as he.
==63==He durst not sit there, had your father liv’d.
==64==My gracious lord, here in the parliament
==65==Let us assail the family of York.

**NORTH.**
==66==Well hast thou spoken, cousin, be it so.

**KING.**
==67==Ah, know you not the city favors them,
==68==And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?

**EXE.**
==69==But when the Duke is slain, they’ll quickly fly.

**KING.**
==70==Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart,
==71==To make a shambles of the parliament house!
==72==Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats
==73==Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
==74==Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
==75==And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet:
==76==I am thy sovereign.

**YORK.**
==76==           I am thine.

**EXE.**
==77==For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of York.

**YORK.**
==78==It was my inheritance, as the earldom was.

**EXE.**
==79==Thy father was a traitor to the crown.

**WAR.**
==80==Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown,
==81==In following this usurping Henry.

**CLIF.**
==82==Whom should he follow but his natural king?

**WAR.**
==83==True, Clifford, that’s Richard Duke of York.

**KING.**
==84==And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?

**YORK.**
==85==It must and shall be so. Content thyself.

**WAR.**
==86==Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be King.

**WEST.**
==87==He is both King and Duke of Lancaster,
==88==And that the Lord of Westmorland shall maintain.

**WAR.**
==89==And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
==90==That we are those which chas’d you from the field,
==91==And slew your fathers, and with colors spread
==92==March’d through the city to the palace gates.

**NORTH.**
==93==Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,
==94==And by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.

**WEST.**
==95==Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
==96==Thy kinsmen and thy friends, I’ll have more lives
==97==Than drops of blood were in my father’s veins.

**CLIF.**
==98==Urge it no more, lest that, in stead of words,
==99==I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
==100==As shall revenge his death before I stir.

**WAR.**
==101==Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!

**YORK.**
==102==Will you we show our title to the crown?
==103==If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.

**KING.**
==104==What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
==105==Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York,
==106==Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
==107==I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
==108==Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,
==109==And seiz’d upon their towns and provinces.

**WAR.**
==110==Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.

**KING.**
==111==The Lord Protector lost it, and not I;
==112==When I was crown’d I was but nine months old.

**RICH.**
==113==You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.
==114==Father, tear the crown from the usurper’s head.

**EDW.**
==115==Sweet father, do so, set it on your head.

**MONT.**
==116==Good brother, as thou lov’st and honorest arms,
==117==Let’s fight it out, and not stand cavilling thus.

**RICH.**
==118==Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.

**YORK.**
==119==Sons, peace!

**KING.**
==120==Peace thou! And give King Henry leave to speak.

**WAR.**
==121==Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords,
==122==And be you silent and attentive too,
==123==For he that interrupts him shall not live.

**KING.**
==124==Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
==125==Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
==126==No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;
==127==Ay, and their colors, often borne in France,
==128==And now in England to our heart’s great sorrow,
==129==Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
==130==My title’s good, and better far than his.

**WAR.**
==131==Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be King.

**KING.**
==132==Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.

**YORK.**
==133==’Twas by rebellion against his king.

**KING.**
*(Aside.)*
==134==I know not what to say, my title’s weak.⁠—
==135==Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?

**YORK.**
==136==What then?

**KING.**
==137==And if he may, then am I lawful king;
==138==For Richard, in the view of many lords,
==139==Resign’d the crown to Henry the Fourth,
==140==Whose heir my father was, and I am his.

**YORK.**
==141==He rose against him, being his sovereign,
==142==And made him to resign his crown perforce.

**WAR.**
==143==Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain’d,
==144==Think you ’twere prejudicial to his crown?

**EXE.**
==145==No; for he could not so resign his crown
==146==But that the next heir should succeed and reign.

**KING.**
==147==Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?

**EXE.**
==148==His is the right, and therefore pardon me.

**YORK.**
==149==Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?

**EXE.**
==150==My conscience tells me he is lawful king.

**KING.**
*(Aside.)*
==151==All will revolt from me and turn to him.

**NORTH.**
==152==Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay’st,
==153==Think not that Henry shall be so depos’d.

**WAR.**
==154==Depos’d he shall be, in despite of all.

**NORTH.**
==155==Thou art deceiv’d. ’Tis not thy southern power
==156==Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
==157==Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
==158==Can set the Duke up in despite of me.

**CLIF.**
==159==King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
==160==Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defense.
==161==May that ground gape, and swallow me alive,
==162==Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!

**KING.**
==163==O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!

**YORK.**
==164==Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
==165==What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?

**WAR.**
==166==Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
==167==Or I will fill the house with armed men,
==168==And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
==169==Write up his title with usurping blood.

*He stamps with his foot, and the Soldiers show themselves.*

**KING.**
==170==My Lord of Warwick, hear but one word:
==171==Let me for this my lifetime reign as king.

**YORK.**
==172==Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
==173==And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv’st.

**KING.**
==174==I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
==175==Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.

**CLIF.**
==176==What wrong is this unto the Prince your son!

**WAR.**
==177==What good is this to England and himself!

**WEST.**
==178==Base, fearful, and despairing Henry!

**CLIF.**
==179==How hast thou injur’d both thyself and us!

**WEST.**
==180==I cannot stay to hear these articles.

**NORTH.**
==181==Nor I.

**CLIF.**
==182==Come, cousin, let us tell the Queen these news.

**WEST.**
==183==Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
==184==In whose cold blood no spark of honor bides.

*Exit.*

**NORTH.**
==185==Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
==186==And die in bands for this unmanly deed!

*Exit.*

**CLIF.**
==187==In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
==188==Or live in peace abandon’d and despis’d!

*Exit.*

**WAR.**
==189==Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.

**EXE.**
==190==They seek revenge, and therefore will not yield.

**KING.**
==191==Ah, Exeter!

**WAR.**
==191==        Why should you sigh, my lord?

**KING.**
==192==Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
==193==Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
==194==But be it as it may.
*(To York.)*
==194==           I here entail
==195==The crown to thee and to thine heirs forever,
==196==Conditionally that here thou take an oath
==197==To cease this civil war, and whilst I live
==198==To honor me as thy king and sovereign,
==199==And neither by treason nor hostility
==200==To seek to put me down and reign thyself.

**YORK.**
==201==This oath I willingly take and will perform.

**WAR.**
==202==Long live King Henry! Plantagenet, embrace him.

**KING.**
==203==And long live thou, and these thy forward sons!

**YORK.**
==204==Now York and Lancaster are reconcil’d.

**EXE.**
==205==Accurs’d be he that seeks to make them foes!

*Sennet. Here they come down.*

**YORK.**
==206==Farewell, my gracious lord, I’ll to my castle.

*Exeunt York and his sons with Soldiers.*

**WAR.**
==207==And I’ll keep London with my soldiers.

*Exit with Soldiers.*

**NORF.**
==208==And I to Norfolk with my followers.

*Exit with Soldiers.*

**MONT.**
==209==And I unto the sea, from whence I came.

*Exit with Soldiers.*

**KING.**
==210==And I with grief and sorrow to the court.

*Enter the Queen Margaret and Prince Edward.*

**EXE.**
==211==Here comes the Queen, whose looks bewray her anger.
==212==I’ll steal away.

**KING.**
==212==        Exeter, so will I.

**Q. MARG.**
==213==Nay, go not from me, I will follow thee.

**KING.**
==214==Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.

**Q. MARG.**
==215==Who can be patient in such extremes?
==216==Ah, wretched man, would I had died a maid
==217==And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
==218==Seeing thou hast prov’d so unnatural a father!
==219==Hath he deserv’d to lose his birthright thus?
==220==Hadst thou but lov’d him half so well as I,
==221==Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
==222==Or nourish’d him as I did with my blood,
==223==Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there
==224==Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir,
==225==And disinherited thine only son.

**PRINCE.**
==226==Father, you cannot disinherit me.
==227==If you be king, why should not I succeed?

**KING.**
==228==Pardon me, Margaret, pardon me, sweet son,
==229==The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc’d me.

**Q. MARG.**
==230==Enforc’d thee? Art thou king, and wilt be forc’d?
==231==I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch,
==232==Thou hast undone thyself, thy son, and me,
==233==And giv’n unto the house of York such head
==234==As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
==235==To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
==236==What is it, but to make thy sepulcher,
==237==And creep into it far before thy time?
==238==Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Callice,
==239==Stern Faulconbridge commands the Narrow Seas,
==240==The Duke is made Protector of the realm,
==241==And yet shalt thou be safe? Such safety finds
==242==The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
==243==Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
==244==The soldiers should have toss’d me on their pikes,
==245==Before I would have granted to that act.
==246==But thou prefer’st thy life before thine honor;
==247==And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
==248==Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
==249==Until that act of parliament be repeal’d
==250==Whereby my son is disinherited.
==251==The northern lords that have forsworn thy colors
==252==Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
==253==And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace,
==254==And utter ruin of the house of York.
==255==Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let’s away.
==256==Our army is ready; come, we’ll after them.

**KING.**
==257==Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.

**Q. MARG.**
==258==Thou hast spoke too much already; get thee gone.

**KING.**
==259==Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?

**Q. MARG.**
==260==Ay, to be murder’d by his enemies.

**PRINCE.**
==261==When I return with victory from the field
==262==I’ll see your Grace; till then, I’ll follow her.

**Q. MARG.**
==263==Come, son, away, we may not linger thus.

*Exeunt Queen Margaret and the Prince.*

**KING.**
==264==Poor queen, how love to me and to her son
==265==Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
==266==Reveng’d may she be on that hateful duke,
==267==Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
==268==Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
==269==Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
==270==The loss of those three lords torments my heart;
==271==I’ll write unto them and entreat them fair;
==272==Come, cousin, you shall be the messenger.

**EXE.**
==273==And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
