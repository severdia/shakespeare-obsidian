## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 7|Act 4, Scene 7 →]]

*London. The Tower.*

*Flourish. Enter King Henry the Sixth, Clarence, Warwick, Somerset, young Henry Richmond, Oxford, Montague, and Lieutenant of the Tower.*

**KING.**
==1==Master Lieutenant, now that God and friends
==2==Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
==3==And turn’d my captive state to liberty,
==4==My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
==5==At our enlargement what are thy due fees?

**LIEU.**
==6==Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov’reigns,
==7==But if an humble prayer may prevail,
==8==I then crave pardon of your Majesty.

**KING.**
==9==For what, Lieutenant? For well using me?
==10==Nay, be thou sure, I’ll well requite thy kindness,
==11==For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
==12==Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
==13==Conceive, when, after many moody thoughts,
==14==At last by notes of household harmony
==15==They quite forget their loss of liberty.
==16==But, Warwick, after God, thou set’st me free,
==17==And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee.
==18==He was the author, thou the instrument.
==19==Therefore that I may conquer fortune’s spite
==20==By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
==21==And that the people of this blessed land
==22==May not be punish’d with my thwarting stars,
==23==Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
==24==I here resign my government to thee,
==25==For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.

**WAR.**
==26==Your Grace hath still been fam’d for virtuous,
==27==And now may seem as wise as virtuous
==28==By spying and avoiding fortune’s malice,
==29==For few men rightly temper with the stars;
==30==Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace,
==31==For choosing me when Clarence is in place.

**CLAR.**
==32==No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
==33==To whom the heav’ns in thy nativity
==34==Adjudg’d an olive branch and laurel crown,
==35==As likely to be blest in peace and war;
==36==And therefore I yield thee my free consent.

**WAR.**
==37==And I choose Clarence only for Protector.

**KING.**
==38==Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.
==39==Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
==40==That no dissension hinder government.
==41==I make you both Protectors of this land,
==42==While I myself will lead a private life,
==43==And in devotion spend my latter days,
==44==To sin’s rebuke and my Creator’s praise.

**WAR.**
==45==What answers Clarence to his sovereign’s will?

**CLAR.**
==46==That he consents, if Warwick yield consent,
==47==For on thy fortune I repose myself.

**WAR.**
==48==Why then, though loath, yet must I be content.
==49==We’ll yoke together like a double shadow
==50==To Henry’s body, and supply his place;
==51==I mean, in bearing weight of government,
==52==While he enjoys the honor and his ease.
==53==And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
==54==Forthwith that Edward be pronounc’d a traitor,
==55==And all his lands and goods confiscate.

**CLAR.**
==56==What else? And that succession be determined.

**WAR.**
==57==Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.

**KING.**
==58==But with the first of all your chief affairs,
==59==Let me entreat (for I command no more) 
==60==That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
==61==Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
==62==For till I see them here, by doubtful fear
==63==My joy of liberty is half eclips’d.

**CLAR.**
==64==It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.

**KING.**
==65==My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that
==66==Of whom you seem to have so tender care?

**D. SOM.**
==67==My liege, it is young Henry, Earl of Richmond.

**KING.**
==68==Come hither, England’s hope.
*(Lays his hand on his head.)*
==68==                If secret powers
==69==Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
==70==This pretty lad will prove our country’s bliss.
==71==His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
==72==His head by nature fram’d to wear a crown,
==73==His hand to wield a scepter, and himself
==74==Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
==75==Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
==76==Must help you more than you are hurt by me.

*Enter Warwick’s Messenger.*

**WAR.**
==77==What news, my friend?

**WAR. MESS.**
==78==That Edward is escaped from your brother,
==79==And fled (as he hears since) to Burgundy.

**WAR.**
==80==Unsavory news! But how made he escape?

**WAR. MESS.**
==81==He was convey’d by Richard, Duke of Gloucester,
==82==And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
==83==In secret ambush on the forest side,
==84==And from the Bishop’s huntsmen rescu’d him;
==85==For hunting was his daily exercise.

**WAR.**
==86==My brother was too careless of his charge.
==87==But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
==88==A salve for any sore that may betide.

*Exeunt. Manent Somerset, Richmond, and Oxford.*

**D. SOM.**
==89==My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward’s;
==90==For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
==91==And we shall have more wars before’t be long.
==92==As Henry’s late presaging prophecy
==93==Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
==94==So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
==95==What may befall him, to his harm and ours.
==96==Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
==97==Forthwith we’ll send him hence to Brittany,
==98==Till storms be past of civil enmity.

**OXF.**
==99==Ay; for if Edward repossess the crown,
==100==’Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.

**D. SOM.**
==101==It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
==102==Come therefore, let’s about it speedily.

*Exeunt.*
