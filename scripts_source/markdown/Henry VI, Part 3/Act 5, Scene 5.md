## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 6|Act 5, Scene 6 →]]

*Another part of the battlefield near Barnet.*

*Flourish. Enter King Edward, Richard of Gloucester with Queen Margaret prisoner, Clarence, and Soldiers with Oxford, Somerset prisoners.*

**K. EDW.**
==1== Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
==2== Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight;
==3== For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
==4== Go bear them hence, I will not hear them speak.

**OXF.**
==5== For my part, I’ll not trouble thee with words.

**D. SOM.**
==6== Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.

*Exeunt Oxford and Somerset, guarded.*

**Q. MARG.**
==7== So part we sadly in this troublous world,
==8== To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.

**K. EDW.**
==9== Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
==10== Shall have a high reward, and he his life?

**GLOU.**
==11== It is, and lo where youthful Edward comes!

*Enter Soldiers with the Prince Edward.*

**K. EDW.**
==12== Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
==13== What? Can so young a thorn begin to prick?
==14== Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
==15== For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
==16== And all the trouble thou hast turn’d me to?

**PRINCE.**
==17== Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
==18== Suppose that I am now my father’s mouth:
==19== Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
==20== Whilst I propose the self-same words to thee,
==21== Which, traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.

**Q. MARG.**
==22== Ah, that thy father had been so resolv’d!

**GLOU.**
==23== That you might still have worn the petticoat,
==24== And ne’er have stol’n the breech from Lancaster.

**PRINCE.**
==25== Let Aesop fable in a winter’s night,
==26== His currish riddles sorts not with this place.

**GLOU.**
==27== By heaven, brat, I’ll plague ye for that word.

**Q. MARG.**
==28== Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.

**GLOU.**
==29== For God’s sake, take away this captive scold.

**PRINCE.**
==30== Nay, take away this scolding crook-back, rather.

**K. EDW.**
==31== Peace, willful boy, or I will charm your tongue.

**CLAR.**
==32== Untutor’d lad, thou art too malapert.

**PRINCE.**
==33== I know my duty, you are all undutiful.
==34== Lascivious Edward, and thou perjur’d George,
==35== And thou misshapen Dick, I tell ye all
==36== I am your better, traitors as ye are,
==37== And thou usurp’st my father’s right and mine.

**K. EDW.**
==38== Take that, the likeness of this railer here.

*Stabs him.*

**GLOU.**
==39== Sprawl’st thou? Take that, to end thy agony.

*Richard stabs him.*

**CLAR.**
==40== And there’s for twitting me with perjury.

*Clarence stabs him.*

**Q. MARG.**
==41== O, kill me too!

**GLOU.**
==42== Marry, and shall.

*Offers to kill her.*

**K. EDW.**
==43== Hold, Richard, hold, for we have done too much.

**GLOU.**
==44== Why should she live, to fill the world with words?

**K. EDW.**
==45== What? Doth she swoun? Use means for her recovery.

**GLOU.**
==46== Clarence, excuse me to the King my brother;
==47== I’ll hence to London on a serious matter.
==48== Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.

**CLAR.**
==49== What? What?

**GLOU.**
==50== The Tower, the Tower.

*Exit.*

**Q. MARG.**
==51== O Ned, sweet Ned, speak to thy mother, boy!
==52== Canst thou not speak? O traitors, murderers!
==53== They that stabb’d Caesar shed no blood at all,
==54== Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
==55== If this foul deed were by to equal it.
==56== He was a man; this, in respect, a child,
==57== And men ne’er spend their fury on a child.
==58== What’s worse than murderer, that I may name it?
==59== No, no, my heart will burst and if I speak,
==60== And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
==61== Butchers and villains! Bloody cannibals!
==62== How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp’d!
==63== You have no children, butchers; if you had,
==64== The thought of them would have stirr’d up remorse,
==65== But if you ever chance to have a child,
==66== Look in his youth to have him so cut off
==67== As, deathsmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!

**K. EDW.**
==68== Away with her, go bear her hence perforce.

**Q. MARG.**
==69== Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here;
==70== Here sheathe thy sword, I’ll pardon thee my death.
==71== What? Wilt thou not? Then, Clarence, do it thou.

**CLAR.**
==72== By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.

**Q. MARG.**
==73== Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.

**CLAR.**
==74== Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?

**Q. MARG.**
==75== Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself.
==76== ’Twas sin before, but now ’tis charity.
==77== What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil’s butcher,
==78== Hard-favor’d Richard? Richard, where art thou?
==79== Thou art not here. Murder is thy alms-deed;
==80== Petitioners for blood thou ne’er put’st back.

**K. EDW.**
==81== Away I say, I charge ye bear her hence.

**Q. MARG.**
==82== So come to you, and yours, as to this prince!

*Exit Queen Margaret, led out forcibly.*

**K. EDW.**
==83== Where’s Richard gone?

**CLAR.**
==84== To London, all in post, and as I guess,
==85== To make a bloody supper in the Tower.

**K. EDW.**
==86== He’s sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
==87== Now march we hence. Discharge the common sort
==88== With pay and thanks, and let’s away to London
==89== And see our gentle queen how well she fares.
==90== By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.

*Exeunt.*
