## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Yorkshire. A battlefield between Towton and Saxton.*

*Alarum. Excursions. Enter Warwick.*

**WAR.**
==1==Forespent with toil, as runners with a race,
==2==I lay me down a little while to breathe;
==3==For strokes receiv’d and many blows repaid
==4==Have robb’d my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
==5==And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.

*Enter Edward running.*

**EDW.**
==6==Smile, gentle heaven! Or strike, ungentle death!
==7==For this world frowns, and Edward’s sun is clouded.

**WAR.**
==8==How now, my lord, what hap? What hope of good?

*Enter George of Clarence.*

**GEO.**
==9==Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair,
==10==Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us.
==11==What counsel give you? Whither shall we fly?

**EDW.**
==12==Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings,
==13==And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.

*Enter Richard running.*

**RICH.**
==14==Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
==15==Thy brother’s blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
==16==Broach’d with the steely point of Clifford’s lance;
==17==And in the very pangs of death he cried,
==18==Like to a dismal clangor heard from far,
==19==“Warwick, revenge! Brother, revenge my death!”
==20==So underneath the belly of their steeds,
==21==That stain’d their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
==22==The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.

**WAR.**
==23==Then let the earth be drunken with our blood!
==24==I’ll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
==25==Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
==26==Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage,
==27==And look upon, as if the tragedy
==28==Were play’d in jest by counterfeiting actors?
==29==Here on my knee I vow to God above
==30==I’ll never pause again, never stand still,
==31==Till either death hath clos’d these eyes of mine
==32==Or fortune given me measure of revenge.

**EDW.**
==33==O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine,
==34==And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
==35==And ere my knee rise from the earth’s cold face,
==36==I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to Thee,
==37==Thou setter-up and plucker-down of kings,
==38==Beseeching thee (if with thy will it stands) 
==39==That to my foes this body must be prey,
==40==Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
==41==And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
==42==Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
==43==Where e’er it be, in heaven or in earth.

**RICH.**
==44==Brother, give me thy hand, and gentle Warwick,
==45==Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.
==46==I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
==47==That winter should cut off our spring-time so.

**WAR.**
==48==Away, away! Once more, sweet lords, farewell.

**GEO.**
==49==Yet let us all together to our troops,
==50==And give them leave to fly that will not stay;
==51==And call them pillars that will stand to us;
==52==And if we thrive, promise them such rewards
==53==As victors wear at the Olympian games.
==54==This may plant courage in their quailing breasts,
==55==For yet is hope of life and victory.
==56==Foreslow no longer, make we hence amain.

*Exeunt.*
