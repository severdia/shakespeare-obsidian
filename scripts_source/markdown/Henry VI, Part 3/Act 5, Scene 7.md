## Act 5, Scene 7
[[Act 5, Scene 6|← Act 5, Scene 6]]

*London. A room in the palace.*

*Flourish. Enter King Edward, Queen Elizabeth, Clarence, Richard of Gloucester, Hastings, Nurse with the young Prince, and Attendants.*

**K. EDW.**
==1==Once more we sit in England’s royal throne,
==2==Repurchas’d with the blood of enemies.
==3==What valiant foemen, like to autumn’s corn,
==4==Have we mow’d down in tops of all their pride!
==5==Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown’d
==6==For hardy and undoubted champions;
==7==Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
==8==And two Northumberlands—two braver men
==9==Ne’er spurr’d their coursers at the trumpet’s sound;
==10==With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
==11==That in their chains fetter’d the kingly lion,
==12==And made the forest tremble when they roar’d.
==13==Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat,
==14==And made our footstool of security.
==15==Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
==16==Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
==17==Have in our armors watch’d the winter’s night,
==18==Went all afoot in summer’s scalding heat,
==19==That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace,
==20==And of our labors thou shalt reap the gain.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside.)*
==21==I’ll blast his harvest, and your head were laid,
==22==For yet I am not look’d on in the world.
==23==This shoulder was ordain’d so thick to heave,
==24==And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:
==25==Work thou the way—and that shall execute.

**K. EDW.**
==26==Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen,
==27==And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.

**CLAR.**
==28==The duty that I owe unto your Majesty
==29==I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==30==Thanks, noble Clarence, worthy brother, thanks.

**GLOU.**
==31==And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang’st,
==32==Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
*(Aside.)*
==33==To say the truth, so Judas kiss’d his master,
==34==And cried “All hail!” when as he meant all harm.

**K. EDW.**
==35==Now am I seated as my soul delights,
==36==Having my country’s peace and brothers’ loves.

**CLAR.**
==37==What will your Grace have done with Margaret?
==38==Reignier, her father, to the King of France
==39==Hath pawn’d the Sicils and Jerusalem,
==40==And hither have they sent it for her ransom.

**K. EDW.**
==41==Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
==42==And now what rests but that we spend the time
==43==With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
==44==Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
==45==Sound drums and trumpets! Farewell sour annoy!
==46==For here I hope begins our lasting joy.

*Exeunt omnes.*
