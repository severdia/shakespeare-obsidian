## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the field of battle between Sandal Castle and Wakefield.*

*Alarum. Enter Richard Duke of York.*

**YORK.**
==1==The army of the Queen hath got the field:
==2==My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
==3==And all my followers to the eager foe
==4==Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind,
==5==Or lambs pursu’d by hunger-starved wolves.
==6==My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them;
==7==But this I know, they have demean’d themselves
==8==Like men born to renown by life or death.
==9==Three times did Richard make a lane to me,
==10==And thrice cried, “Courage, father! Fight it out!”
==11==And full as oft came Edward to my side
==12==With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
==13==In blood of those that had encount’red him.
==14==And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
==15==Richard cried, “Charge! And give no foot of ground!”
==16==And cried, “A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
==17==A scepter, or an earthly sepulchre!”
==18==With this we charg’d again; but out, alas,
==19==We bodg’d again, as I have seen a swan
==20==With bootless labor swim against the tide,
==21==And spend her strength with overmatching waves.
*(A short alarum within.)*
==22==Ah, hark, the fatal followers do pursue,
==23==And I am faint, and cannot fly their fury;
==24==And were I strong, I would not shun their fury.
==25==The sands are numb’red that makes up my life,
==26==Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
*(Enter the Queen Margaret, Clifford, Northumberland, the young Prince Edward, and Soldiers.)*
==27==Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
==28==I dare your quenchless fury to more rage.
==29==I am your butt, and I abide your shot.

**NORTH.**
==30==Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.

**CLIF.**
==31==Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm
==32==With downright payment show’d unto my father.
==33==Now Phaëton hath tumbled from his car,
==34==And made an evening at the noontide prick.

**YORK.**
==35==My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
==36==A bird that will revenge upon you all;
==37==And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
==38==Scorning what e’er you can afflict me with.
==39==Why come you not? What, multitudes, and fear?

**CLIF.**
==40==So cowards fight when they can fly no further,
==41==So doves do peck the falcon’s piercing talons,
==42==So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
==43==Breathe out invectives ’gainst the officers.

**YORK.**
==44==O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
==45==And in thy thought o’errun my former time;
==46==And if thou canst for blushing, view this face,
==47==And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
==48==Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!

**CLIF.**
==49==I will not bandy with thee word for word,
==50==But buckler with thee blows, twice two for one.

**Q. MARG.**
==51==Hold, valiant Clifford! For a thousand causes
==52==I would prolong a while the traitor’s life.
==53==Wrath makes him deaf; speak thou, Northumberland.

**NORTH.**
==54==Hold, Clifford, do not honor him so much
==55==To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart.
==56==What valor were it, when a cur doth grin,
==57==For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
==58==When he might spurn him with his foot away?
==59==It is war’s prize to take all vantages,
==60==And ten to one is no impeach of valor.

*They lay hands on York, who struggles.*

**CLIF.**
==61==Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.

**NORTH.**
==62==So doth the cony struggle in the net.

**YORK.**
==63==So triumph thieves upon their conquer’d booty,
==64==So true men yield, with robbers so o’ermatch’d.

**NORTH.**
==65==What would your Grace have done unto him now?

**Q. MARG.**
==66==Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
==67==Come make him stand upon this molehill here
==68==That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
==69==Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
==70==What, was it you that would be England’s king?
==71==Was’t you that revell’d in our parliament,
==72==And made a preachment of your high descent?
==73==Where are your mess of sons to back you now,
==74==The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
==75==And where’s that valiant crook-back prodigy,
==76==Dicky, your boy, that with his grumbling voice
==77==Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
==78==Or with the rest, where is your darling, Rutland?
==79==Look, York, I stain’d this napkin with the blood
==80==That valiant Clifford with his rapier’s point
==81==Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
==82==And if thine eyes can water for his death,
==83==I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
==84==Alas, poor York, but that I hate thee deadly,
==85==I should lament thy miserable state.
==86==I prithee grieve, to make me merry, York.
==87==What, hath thy fiery heart so parch’d thine entrails
==88==That not a tear can fall for Rutland’s death?
==89==Why art thou patient, man? Thou shouldst be mad;
==90==And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
==91==Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
==92==Thou wouldst be fee’d, I see, to make me sport:
==93==York cannot speak unless he wear a crown.
==94==A crown for York! And, lords, bow low to him;
==95==Hold you his hands whilest I do set it on.
*(Putting a paper crown on his head.)*
==96==Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
==97==Ay, this is he that took King Henry’s chair,
==98==And this is he was his adopted heir.
==99==But how is it that great Plantagenet
==100==Is crown’d so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
==101==As I bethink me, you should not be king
==102==Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
==103==And will you pale your head in Henry’s glory,
==104==And rob his temples of the diadem,
==105==Now in his life, against your holy oath?
==106==O, ’tis a fault too too unpardonable!
==107==Off with the crown; and, with the crown, his head,
==108==And whilest we breathe, take time to do him dead.

**CLIF.**
==109==That is my office, for my father’s sake.

**Q. MARG.**
==110==Nay, stay, let’s hear the orisons he makes.

**YORK.**
==111==She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
==112==Whose tongue more poisons than the adder’s tooth!
==113==How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
==114==To triumph like an Amazonian trull
==115==Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
==116==But that thy face is vizard-like, unchanging,
==117==Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
==118==I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
==119==To tell thee whence thou cam’st, of whom deriv’d,
==120==Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
==121==Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
==122==Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
==123==Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
==124==Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
==125==It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
==126==Unless the adage must be verified,
==127==That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
==128==’Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,
==129==But God he knows thy share thereof is small.
==130==’Tis virtue that doth make them most admir’d,
==131==The contrary doth make thee wond’red at.
==132==’Tis government that makes them seem divine,
==133==The want thereof makes thee abominable.
==134==Thou art as opposite to every good
==135==As the antipodes are unto us,
==136==Or as the south to the septentrion.
==137==O tiger’s heart wrapp’d in a woman’s hide!
==138==How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
==139==To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
==140==And yet be seen to wear a woman’s face?
==141==Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible;
==142==Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
==143==Bid’st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish:
==144==Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will:
==145==For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
==146==And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
==147==These tears are my sweet Rutland’s obsequies,
==148==And every drop cries vengeance for his death
==149==’Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false Frenchwoman.

**NORTH.**
==150==Beshrew me, but his passions moves me so
==151==That hardly can I check my eyes from tears.

**YORK.**
==152==That face of his the hungry cannibals
==153==Would not have touch’d, would not have stain’d with blood;
==154==But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
==155==O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
==156==See, ruthless queen, a hapless father’s tears!
==157==This cloth thou dipp’dst in blood of my sweet boy,
==158==And I with tears do wash the blood away.
==159==Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this,
==160==And if thou tell’st the heavy story right,
==161==Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
==162==Yea, even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
==163==And say, “Alas, it was a piteous deed!”
==164==There, take the crown, and with the crown, my curse,
==165==And in thy need such comfort come to thee
==166==As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
==167==Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world,
==168==My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!

**NORTH.**
==169==Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
==170==I should not for my life but weep with him,
==171==To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.

**Q. MARG.**
==172==What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
==173==Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
==174==And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.

**CLIF.**
==175==Here’s for my oath, here’s for my father’s death.

*Stabbing him.*

**Q. MARG.**
==176==And here’s to right our gentle-hearted king.

*Stabbing him.*

**YORK.**
==177==Open thy gate of mercy, gracious God!
==178==My soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee.

*Dies.*

**Q. MARG.**
==179==Off with his head, and set it on York gates,
==180==So York may overlook the town of York.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
