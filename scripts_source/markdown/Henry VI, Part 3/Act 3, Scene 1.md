## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 6|← Act 2, Scene 6]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*A forest in the North of England.*

*Enter two Gamekeepers with cross-bows in their hands.*

**1. KEEP.**
==1== Under this thick-grown brake we’ll shroud ourselves,
==2== For through this laund anon the deer will come,
==3== And in this covert will we make our stand,
==4== Culling the principal of all the deer.

**2. KEEP.**
==5== I’ll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.

**1. KEEP.**
==6== That cannot be, the noise of thy crossbow
==7== Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
==8== Here stand we both and aim we at the best;
==9== And for the time shall not seem tedious,
==10== I’ll tell thee what befell me on a day
==11== In this self place where now we mean to stand.

**2. KEEP.**
==12== Here comes a man, let’s stay till he be past.

*Enter the King Henry, disguised, with a prayer-book.*

**KING.**
==13== From Scotland am I stol’n, even of pure love,
==14== To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
==15== No, Harry, Harry, ’tis no land of thine;
==16== Thy place is fill’d, thy scepter wrung from thee,
==17== Thy balm wash’d off wherewith thou was anointed.
==18== No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
==19== No humble suitors press to speak for right,
==20== No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
==21== For how can I help them and not myself?

**1. KEEP.**
==22== Ay, here’s a deer whose skin’s a keeper’s fee:
==23== This is the quondam king; let’s seize upon him.

**KING.**
==24== Let me embrace thee, sour adversities,
==25== For wise men say it is the wisest course.

**2. KEEP.**
==26== Why linger we? Let us lay hands upon him.

**1. KEEP.**
==27== Forbear awhile, we’ll hear a little more.

**KING.**
==28== My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
==29== And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
==30== Is thither gone to crave the French king’s sister
==31== To wife for Edward. If this news be true,
==32== Poor queen and son, your labor is but lost;
==33== For Warwick is a subtle orator,
==34== And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
==35== By this account then, Margaret may win him,
==36== For she’s a woman to be pitied much.
==37== Her sighs will make a batt’ry in his breast,
==38== Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
==39== The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
==40== And Nero will be tainted with remorse
==41== To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
==42== Ay, but she’s come to beg; Warwick, to give:
==43== She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry;
==44== He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
==45== She weeps, and says her Henry is depos’d;
==46== He smiles, and says his Edward is install’d;
==47== That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
==48== Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
==49== Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
==50== And in conclusion wins the King from her
==51== With promise of his sister and what else,
==52== To strengthen and support King Edward’s place.
==53== O Margaret, thus ’twill be, and thou, poor soul,
==54== Art then forsaken, as thou went’st forlorn!

**2. KEEP.**
==55== Say, what art thou talk’st of kings and queens?

**KING.**
==56== More than I seem, and less than I was born to;
==57== A man at least, for less I should not be;
==58== And men may talk of kings, and why not I?

**2. KEEP.**
==59== Ay, but thou talk’st as if thou wert a king.

**KING.**
==60== Why, so I am—in mind, and that’s enough.

**2. KEEP.**
==61== But if thou be a king, where is thy crown?

**KING.**
==62== My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
==63== Not deck’d with diamonds and Indian stones,
==64== Nor to be seen. My crown is call’d content,
==65== A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.

**2. KEEP.**
==66== Well, if you be a king crown’d with content,
==67== Your crown content and you must be contented
==68== To go along with us; for, as we think,
==69== You are the king King Edward hath depos’d;
==70== And we his subjects, sworn in all allegiance,
==71== Will apprehend you as his enemy.

**KING.**
==72== But did you never swear and break an oath?

**2. KEEP.**
==73== No, never such an oath, nor will not now.

**KING.**
==74== Where did you dwell when I was King of England?

**2. KEEP.**
==75== Here in this country where we now remain.

**KING.**
==76== I was anointed king at nine months old,
==77== My father and my grandfather were kings;
==78== And you were sworn true subjects unto me;
==79== And tell me then, have you not broke your oaths?

**1. KEEP.**
==80== No,
==81== For we were subjects but while you were king.

**KING.**
==82== Why? Am I dead? Do I not breathe a man?
==83== Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
==84== Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
==85== And as the air blows it to me again,
==86== Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
==87== And yielding to another when it blows,
==88== Commanded always by the greater gust,
==89== Such is the lightness of you common men.
==90== But do not break your oaths, for of that sin
==91== My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
==92== Go where you will, the King shall be commanded;
==93== And be you kings: command, and I’ll obey.

**1. KEEP.**
==94== We are true subjects to the King, King Edward.

**KING.**
==95== So would you be again to Henry,
==96== If he were seated as King Edward is.

**1. KEEP.**
==97== We charge you, in God’s name and the King’s,
==98== To go with us unto the officers.

**KING.**
==99== In God’s name lead; your king’s name be obey’d,
==100== And what God will, that let your king perform;
==101== And what he will, I humbly yield unto.

*Exeunt.*
