## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Before York.*

*Flourish. Enter the King Henry, the Queen Margaret, Clifford, Northumberland, and young Prince Edward, with Drum and Trumpets.*

**Q. MARG.**
==1==Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
==2==Yonder’s the head of that arch-enemy
==3==That sought to be encompass’d with your crown.
==4==Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?

**KING.**
==5==Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wrack:
==6==To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
==7==Withhold revenge, dear God! ’Tis not my fault,
==8==Nor wittingly have I infring’d my vow.

**CLIF.**
==9==My gracious liege, this too much lenity
==10==And harmful pity must be laid aside.
==11==To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
==12==Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
==13==Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
==14==Not his that spoils her young before her face.
==15==Who scapes the lurking serpent’s mortal sting?
==16==Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
==17==The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,
==18==And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
==19==Ambitious York did level at thy crown,
==20==Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
==21==He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
==22==And raise his issue like a loving sire;
==23==Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
==24==Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
==25==Which argued thee a most unloving father.
==26==Unreasonable creatures feed their young,
==27==And though man’s face be fearful to their eyes,
==28==Yet in protection of their tender ones,
==29==Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
==30==Which sometime they have us’d with fearful flight,
==31==Make war with him that climb’d unto their nest,
==32==Offering their own lives in their young’s defense?
==33==For shame, my liege, make them your president!
==34==Were it not pity that this goodly boy
==35==Should lose his birthright by his father’s fault,
==36==And long hereafter say unto his child,
==37==“What my great-grandfather and grandsire got,
==38==My careless father fondly gave away”?
==39==Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy,
==40==And let his manly face, which promiseth
==41==Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
==42==To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.

**KING.**
==43==Full well hath Clifford play’d the orator,
==44==Inferring arguments of mighty force.
==45==But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
==46==That things ill got had ever bad success?
==47==And happy always was it for that son
==48==Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
==49==I’ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind,
==50==And would my father had left me no more!
==51==For all the rest is held at such a rate
==52==As brings a thousandfold more care to keep
==53==Than in possession any jot of pleasure.
==54==Ah, cousin York, would thy best friends did know
==55==How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!

**Q. MARG.**
==56==My lord, cheer up your spirits, our foes are nigh,
==57==And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
==58==You promis’d knighthood to our forward son,
==59==Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
==60==Edward, kneel down.

**KING.**
==61==Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight,
==62==And learn this lesson: Draw thy sword in right.

**PRINCE.**
==63==My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
==64==I’ll draw it as apparent to the crown,
==65==And in that quarrel use it to the death.

**CLIF.**
==66==Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.

*Enter First Lancastrian Messenger.*

**1. LAN. MESS.**
==67==Royal commanders, be in readiness,
==68==For with a band of thirty thousand men
==69==Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York,
==70==And in the towns, as they do march along,
==71==Proclaims him king, and many fly to him.
==72==Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.

**CLIF.**
==73==I would your Highness would depart the field,
==74==The Queen hath best success when you are absent.

**Q. MARG.**
==75==Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.

**KING.**
==76==Why, that’s my fortune too, therefore I’ll stay.

**NORTH.**
==77==Be it with resolution then to fight.

**PRINCE.**
==78==My royal father, cheer these noble lords,
==79==And hearten those that fight in your defense.
==80==Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry “Saint George!”

*March. Enter Edward, Warwick, Richard, George of Clarence, Norfolk, Montague, and Soldiers.*

**EDW.**
==81==Now, perjur’d Henry, wilt thou kneel for grace,
==82==And set thy diadem upon my head,
==83==Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?

**Q. MARG.**
==84==Go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
==85==Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
==86==Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?

**EDW.**
==87==I am his king, and he should bow his knee.
==88==I was adopted heir by his consent.
==89==Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
==90==You that are king, though he do wear the crown,
==91==Have caus’d him, by new act of parliament,
==92==To blot out me, and put his own son in.

**CLIF.**
==93==And reason too:
==94==Who should succeed the father but the son?

**RICH.**
==95==Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!

**CLIF.**
==96==Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
==97==Or any he the proudest of thy sort.

**RICH.**
==98==’Twas you that kill’d young Rutland, was it not?

**CLIF.**
==99==Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.

**RICH.**
==100==For God’s sake, lords, give signal to the fight.

**WAR.**
==101==What say’st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?

**Q. MARG.**
==102==Why, how now, long-tongu’d Warwick, dare you speak?
==103==When you and I met at Saint Albans last,
==104==Your legs did better service than your hands.

**WAR.**
==105==Then ’twas my turn to fly, and now ’tis thine.

**CLIF.**
==106==You said so much before, and yet you fled.

**WAR.**
==107==’Twas not your valor, Clifford, drove me thence.

**NORTH.**
==108==No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.

**RICH.**
==109==Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
==110==Break off the parley, for scarce I can refrain
==111==The execution of my big-swoll’n heart
==112==Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.

**CLIF.**
==113==I slew thy father, call’st thou him a child?

**RICH.**
==114==Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
==115==As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland,
==116==But ere sunset I’ll make thee curse the deed.

**KING.**
==117==Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.

**Q. MARG.**
==118==Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.

**KING.**
==119==I prithee give no limits to my tongue,
==120==I am a king, and privileg’d to speak.

**CLIF.**
==121==My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
==122==Cannot be cur’d by words; therefore be still.

**RICH.**
==123==Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword.
==124==By Him that made us all, I am resolv’d
==125==That Clifford’s manhood lies upon his tongue.

**EDW.**
==126==Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
==127==A thousand men have broke their fasts today
==128==That ne’er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.

**WAR.**
==129==If thou deny, their blood upon thy head,
==130==For York in justice puts his armor on.

**PRINCE.**
==131==If that be right which Warwick says is right,
==132==There is no wrong, but every thing is right.

**RICH.**
==133==Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands,
==134==For well I wot, thou hast thy mother’s tongue.

**Q. MARG.**
==135==But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam,
==136==But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,
==137==Mark’d by the destinies to be avoided,
==138==As venom toads, or lizards’ dreadful stings.

**RICH.**
==139==Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
==140==Whose father bears the title of a king
==141==(As if a channel should be call’d the sea),
==142==Sham’st thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
==143==To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?

**EDW.**
==144==A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
==145==To make this shameless callet know herself.
==146==Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
==147==Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
==148==And ne’er was Agamemnon’s brother wrong’d
==149==By that false woman as this king by thee.
==150==His father revell’d in the heart of France,
==151==And tam’d the King and made the Dauphin stoop;
==152==And had he match’d according to his state,
==153==He might have kept that glory to this day.
==154==But when he took a beggar to his bed,
==155==And grac’d thy poor sire with his bridal day,
==156==Even then that sunshine brew’d a show’r for him,
==157==That wash’d his father’s fortunes forth of France,
==158==And heap’d sedition on his crown at home.
==159==For what hath broach’d this tumult but thy pride?
==160==Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept,
==161==And we, in pity of the gentle king,
==162==Had slipp’d our claim until another age.

**GEO.**
==163==But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
==164==And that thy summer bred us no increase,
==165==We set the axe to thy usurping root;
==166==And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
==167==Yet know thou, since we have begun to strike,
==168==We’ll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
==169==Or bath’d thy growing with our heated bloods.

**EDW.**
==170==And in this resolution, I defy thee,
==171==Not willing any longer conference,
==172==Since thou deniedst the gentle king to speak.
==173==Sound trumpets! Let our bloody colors wave!
==174==And either victory, or else a grave.

**Q. MARG.**
==175==Stay, Edward.

**EDW.**
==176==No, wrangling woman, we’ll no longer stay,
==177==These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.

*Exeunt omnes.*
