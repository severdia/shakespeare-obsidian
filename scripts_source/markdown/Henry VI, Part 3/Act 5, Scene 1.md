## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 8|← Act 4, Scene 8]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Coventry.*

*Enter Warwick, the Mayor of Coventry, two Messengers, and others, upon the walls.*

**WAR.**
==1==Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
==2==How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?

**OXF. MESS.**
==3==By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.

**WAR.**
==4==How far off is our brother Montague?
==5==Where is the post that came from Montague?

**MONT. MESS.**
==6==By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.

*Enter Sir John Somervile.*

**WAR.**
==7==Say, Somervile, what says my loving son?
==8==And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?

**SOM.**
==9==At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
==10==And do expect him here some two hours hence.

*Drum heard.*

**WAR.**
==11==Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.

**SOM.**
==12==It is not his, my lord, here Southam lies;
==13==The drum your honor hears marcheth from Warwick.

**WAR.**
==14==Who should that be? Belike unlook’d-for friends.

**SOM.**
==15==They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.

*March. Flourish. Enter King Edward, Richard of Gloucester, and Soldiers.*

**K. EDW.**
==16==Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.

**GLOU.**
==17==See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!

**WAR.**
==18==O unbid spite, is sportful Edward come?
==19==Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduc’d,
==20==That we could hear no news of his repair?

**K. EDW.**
==21==Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city-gates,
==22==Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
==23==Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
==24==And he shall pardon thee these outrages.

**WAR.**
==25==Nay rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
==26==Confess who set thee up and pluck’d thee down,
==27==Call Warwick patron, and be penitent?
==28==And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.

**GLOU.**
==29==I thought, at least, he would have said the King,
==30==Or did he make the jest against his will?

**WAR.**
==31==Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?

**GLOU.**
==32==Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give.
==33==I’ll do thee service for so good a gift.

**WAR.**
==34==’Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.

**K. EDW.**
==35==Why then ’tis mine, if but by Warwick’s gift.

**WAR.**
==36==Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight;
==37==And, weakling, Warwick takes his gift again,
==38==And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.

**K. EDW.**
==39==But Warwick’s king is Edward’s prisoner.
==40==And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
==41==What is the body when the head is off?

**GLOU.**
==42==Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
==43==But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
==44==The king was slyly finger’d from the deck!
==45==You left poor Henry at the Bishop’s palace,
==46==And ten to one you’ll meet him in the tower.

**K. EDW.**
==47==’Tis even so, yet you are Warwick still.

**GLOU.**
==48==Come, Warwick, take the time, kneel down, kneel down.
==49==Nay, when? Strike now, or else the iron cools.

**WAR.**
==50==I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
==51==And with the other fling it at thy face,
==52==Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee.

**K. EDW.**
==53==Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
==54==This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair,
==55==Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
==56==Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood:
==57==“Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.”

*Enter Oxford with Drum and Colors.*

**WAR.**
==58==O cheerful colors! See where Oxford comes!

**OXF.**
==59==Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!

*He and his forces enter the city.*

**GLOU.**
==60==The gates are open, let us enter too.

**K. EDW.**
==61==So other foes may set upon our backs.
==62==Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
==63==Will issue out again and bid us battle.
==64==If not, the city being but of small defense,
==65==We’ll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.

**WAR.**
==66==O, welcome, Oxford, for we want thy help.

*Enter Montague with Drum and Colors.*

**MONT.**
==67==Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!

*He and his forces enter the city.*

**GLOU.**
==68==Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
==69==Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.

**K. EDW.**
==70==The harder match’d, the greater victory:
==71==My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.

*Enter Somerset with Drum and Colors.*

**D. SOM.**
==72==Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

*He and his forces enter the city.*

**GLOU.**
==73==Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,
==74==Have sold their lives unto the house of York,
==75==And thou shalt be the third, and this sword hold.

*Enter Clarence with Drum and Colors.*

**WAR.**
==76==And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
==77==Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
==78==With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
==79==More than the nature of a brother’s love!
*(Gloucester and Clarence whisper together.)*
==80==Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.

**CLAR.**
==81==Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
==82==Look here, I throw my infamy at thee.
*(Clarence takes his red rose out of his hat and throws it at Warwick.)*
==83==I will not ruinate my father’s house,
==84==Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
==85==And set up Lancaster. Why, trowest thou, Warwick,
==86==That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
==87==To bend the fatal instruments of war
==88==Against his brother and his lawful king?
==89==Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
==90==To keep that oath were more impiety
==91==Than Jephthah when he sacrific’d his daughter.
==92==I am so sorry for my trespass made
==93==That to deserve well at my brother’s hands,
==94==I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe;
==95==With resolution, wheresoe’er I meet thee
==96==(As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad),
==97==To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
==98==And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
==99==And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
==100==Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends;
==101==And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
==102==For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.

**K. EDW.**
==103==Now welcome more, and ten times more belov’d,
==104==Than if thou never hadst deserv’d our hate.

**GLOU.**
==105==Welcome, good Clarence, this is brother-like.

**WAR.**
==106==O passing traitor, perjur’d and unjust!

**K. EDW.**
==107==What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town, and fight?
==108==Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?

**WAR.**
==109==Alas, I am not coop’d here for defense!
==110==I will away towards Barnet presently,
==111==And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou dar’st.

**K. EDW.**
==112==Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.
==113==Lords, to the field! Saint George and victory!

*Exeunt King Edward and his company. March. Warwick and his company follows.*
