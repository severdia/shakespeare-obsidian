## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Edward’s camp near Warwick.*

*Enter three Watchmen to guard the King’s tent.*

**1. WATCH.**
==1== Come on, my masters, each man take his stand,
==2== The King by this is set him down to sleep.

**2. WATCH.**
==3== What, will he not to bed?

**1. WATCH.**
==4== Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
==5== Never to lie and take his natural rest
==6== Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress’d.

**2. WATCH.**
==7== Tomorrow then belike shall be the day,
==8== If Warwick be so near as men report.

**3. WATCH.**
==9== But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
==10== That with the King here resteth in his tent?

**1. WATCH.**
==11== ’Tis the Lord Hastings, the King’s chiefest friend.

**3. WATCH.**
==12== O, is it so? But why commands the King
==13== That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
==14== While he himself keeps in the cold field?

**2. WATCH.**
==15== ’Tis the more honor, because more dangerous.

**3. WATCH.**
==16== Ay, but give me worship and quietness,
==17== I like it better than a dangerous honor.
==18== If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
==19== ’Tis to be doubted he would waken him.

**1. WATCH.**
==20== Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.

**2. WATCH.**
==21== Ay; wherefore else guard we his royal tent
==22== But to defend his person from night-foes?

*Enter Warwick, Clarence, Oxford, Somerset, and French Soldiers, silent all.*

**WAR.**
==23== This is his tent, and see where stand his guard.
==24== Courage, my masters! Honor now or never!
==25== But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.

**1. WATCH.**
==26== Who goes there?

**2. WATCH.**
==27== Stay, or thou diest!

*Warwick and the rest cry all, “Warwick! Warwick!” and set upon the Guard, who fly, crying, “Arm! Arm!”, Warwick and the rest following them.*

*The Drum playing and Trumpet sounding, enter Warwick, Somerset, and the rest, bringing the King Edward out in his gown, sitting in a chair.*

*Richard of Gloucester and Hastings fly over the stage.*

**D. SOM.**
==28== What are they that fly there?

**WAR.**
==29== Richard and Hastings. Let them go, here is The Duke.

**K. EDW.**
==30== The Duke? Why, Warwick, when we parted,
==31== Thou call’dst me King.

**WAR.**
==31==            Ay, but the case is alter’d.
==32== When you disgrac’d me in my embassade,
==33== Then I degraded you from being king,
==34== And come now to create you Duke of York.
==35== Alas, how should you govern any kingdom,
==36== That know not how to use ambassadors,
==37== Nor how to be contented with one wife,
==38== Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
==39== Nor how to study for the people’s welfare,
==40== Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?

**K. EDW.**
==41== Yea, brother of Clarence, art thou here too?
==42== Nay then I see that Edward needs must down.
==43== Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
==44== Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
==45== Edward will always bear himself as king.
==46== Though Fortune’s malice overthrow my state,
==47== My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.

**WAR.**
==48== Then for his mind, be Edward England’s king.
*(Takes off his crown.)*
==49== But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
==50== And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
==51== My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
==52== See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey’d
==53== Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
==54== When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
==55== I’ll follow you, and tell what answer
==56== Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
==57== Now for awhile farewell, good Duke of York.

*They lead him out forcibly.*

**K. EDW.**
==58== What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
==59== It boots not to resist both wind and tide.

*Exit guarded, with Somerset.*

**OXF.**
==60== What now remains, my lords, for us to do
==61== But march to London with our soldiers?

**WAR.**
==62== Ay, that’s the first thing that we have to do,
==63== To free King Henry from imprisonment,
==64== And see him seated in the regal throne.

*Exeunt.*
