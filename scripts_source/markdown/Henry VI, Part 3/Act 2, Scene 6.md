## Act 2, Scene 6
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Yorkshire. Another part of the battlefield between Towton and Saxton.*

*A loud alarum. Enter Clifford wounded with an arrow in his neck.*

**CLIF.**
==1==Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
==2==Which whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
==3==O Lancaster! I fear thy overthrow
==4==More than my body’s parting with my soul.
==5==My love and fear glu’d many friends to thee,
==6==And now I fall, thy tough commixtures melts,
==7==Impairing Henry, strength’ning misproud York.
==8==The common people swarm like summer flies,
==9==And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
==10==And who shines now but Henry’s enemies?
==11==O Phoebus! Hadst thou never given consent
==12==That Phaëton should check thy fiery steeds,
==13==Thy burning car never had scorch’d the earth.
==14==And, Henry, hadst thou sway’d as kings should do,
==15==Or as thy father and his father did,
==16==Giving no ground unto the house of York,
==17==They never then had sprung like summer flies;
==18==I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
==19==Had left no mourning widows for our death,
==20==And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
==21==For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
==22==And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
==23==Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
==24==No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.
==25==The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
==26==For at their hands I have deserv’d no pity.
==27==The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
==28==And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
==29==Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest,
==30==I stabb’d your fathers’ bosoms, split my breast.

*He faints.*

*Alarum and retreat. Enter Edward, Warwick, Richard, and Soldiers, Montague, and George of Clarence.*

**EDW.**
==31==Now breathe we, lords, good fortune bids us pause
==32==And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
==33==Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
==34==That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
==35==As doth a sail, fill’d with a fretting gust,
==36==Command an argosy to stem the waves.
==37==But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?

**WAR.**
==38==No, ’tis impossible he should escape;
==39==For (though before his face I speak the words) 
==40==Your brother Richard mark’d him for the grave,
==41==And wheresoe’er he is, he’s surely dead.

*Clifford groans and then dies.*

**RICH.**
==42==Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
==43==A deadly groan, like life and death’s departing.
==44==See who it is.

**EDW.**
==45==And, now the battle’s ended,
==46==If friend or foe, let him be gently used.

**RICH.**
==47==Revoke that doom of mercy, for ’tis Clifford,
==48==Who, not contented that he lopp’d the branch
==49==In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
==50==But set his murd’ring knife unto the root
==51==From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
==52==I mean our princely father, Duke of York.

**WAR.**
==53==From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
==54==Your father’s head, which Clifford placed there;
==55==In stead whereof let this supply the room:
==56==Measure for measure must be answered.

**EDW.**
==57==Bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house
==58==That nothing sung but death to us and ours.
==59==Now death shall stop his dismal threat’ning sound,
==60==And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.

**WAR.**
==61==I think his understanding is bereft.
==62==Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
==63==Dark cloudy death o’ershades his beams of life,
==64==And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.

**RICH.**
==65==O would he did! And so, perhaps, he doth;
==66==’Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
==67==Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
==68==Which in the time of death he gave our father.

**GEO.**
==69==If so thou think’st, vex him with eager words.

**RICH.**
==70==Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

**EDW.**
==71==Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.

**WAR.**
==72==Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.

**GEO.**
==73==While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.

**RICH.**
==74==Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.

**EDW.**
==75==Thou pitiedst Rutland, I will pity thee.

**GEO.**
==76==Where’s Captain Margaret, to fence you now?

**WAR.**
==77==They mock thee, Clifford, swear as thou wast wont.

**RICH.**
==78==What, not an oath? Nay, then the world goes hard
==79==When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
==80==I know by that he’s dead, and by my soul,
==81==If this right hand would buy two hours’ life
==82==That I, in all despite, might rail at him,
==83==This hand should chop it off; and with the issuing blood
==84==Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
==85==York and young Rutland could not satisfy.

**WAR.**
==86==Ay, but he’s dead. Off with the traitor’s head,
==87==And rear it in the place your father’s stands.
==88==And now to London with triumphant march,
==89==There to be crowned England’s royal king;
==90==From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
==91==And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen.
==92==So shalt thou sinow both these lands together,
==93==And having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
==94==The scatt’red foe that hopes to rise again;
==95==For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
==96==Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
==97==First will I see the coronation,
==98==And then to Brittany I’ll cross the sea
==99==To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.

**EDW.**
==100==Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
==101==For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
==102==And never will I undertake the thing
==103==Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
==104==Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
==105==And George, of Clarence. Warwick, as ourself,
==106==Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

**RICH.**
==107==Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester,
==108==For Gloucester’s dukedom is too ominous.

**WAR.**
==109==Tut, that’s a foolish observation.
==110==Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London
==111==To see these honors in possession.

*Exeunt.*
