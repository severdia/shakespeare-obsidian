## Act 4, Scene 8
[[Act 4, Scene 7|← Act 4, Scene 7]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*London. A palace room.*

*Flourish. Enter the King Henry, Warwick, Montague, Clarence, Oxford, and Exeter.*

**WAR.**
==1==What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
==2==With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
==3==Hath pass’d in safety through the Narrow Seas,
==4==And with his troops doth march amain to London,
==5==And many giddy people flock to him.

**KING.**
==6==Let’s levy men, and beat him back again.

**CLAR.**
==7==A little fire is quickly trodden out,
==8==Which being suffer’d, rivers cannot quench.

**WAR.**
==9==In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
==10==Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
==11==Those will I muster up; and thou, son Clarence,
==12==Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
==13==The knights and gentlemen to come with thee.
==14==Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
==15==Northampton, and in Leicestershire, shalt find
==16==Men well inclin’d to hear what thou command’st;
==17==And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well belov’d,
==18==In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
==19==My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
==20==Like to his island, girt in with the ocean,
==21==Or modest Dian, circled with her nymphs,
==22==Shall rest in London till we come to him.
==23==Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
==24==Farewell, my sovereign.

**KING.**
==25==Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy’s true hope.

**CLAR.**
==26==In sign of truth, I kiss your Highness’ hand.

**KING.**
==27==Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!

**MONT.**
==28==Comfort, my lord! And so I take my leave.

**OXF.**
==29==And thus
*(Kissing Henry’s hand.)*
==29==        I seal my truth, and bid *adieu*.

**KING.**
==30==Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
==31==And all at once, once more a happy farewell.

**WAR.**
==32==Farewell, sweet lords, let’s meet at Coventry.

*Exeunt all but King Henry and Exeter.*

**KING.**
==33==Here at the palace will I rest a while.
==34==Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
==35==Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
==36==Should not be able to encounter mine.

**EXE.**
==37==The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.

**KING.**
==38==That’s not my fear, my meed hath got me fame:
==39==I have not stopp’d mine ears to their demands,
==40==Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
==41==My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
==42==My mildness hath allay’d their swelling griefs,
==43==My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
==44==I have not been desirous of their wealth,
==45==Nor much oppress’d them with great subsidies,
==46==Nor forward of revenge, though they much err’d.
==47==Then why should they love Edward more than me?
==48==No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace;
==49==And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
==50==The lamb will never cease to follow him.

*Shout within, “A Lancaster! A Lancaster!”*

**EXE.**
==51==Hark, hark, my lord, what shouts are these?

*Enter King Edward and his Soldiers with Gloucester and others.*

**K. EDW.**
==52==Seize on the shame-fac’d Henry, bear him hence,
==53==And once again proclaim us King of England.
==54==You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow;
==55==Now stops thy spring, my sea shall suck them dry,
==56==And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
==57==Hence with him to the Tower, let him not speak.
*(Exit Exeter with King Henry guarded.)*
==58==And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course,
==59==Where peremptory Warwick now remains.
==60==The sun shines hot, and, if we use delay,
==61==Cold biting winter mars our hop’d-for hay.

**GLOU.**
==62==Away betimes, before his forces join,
==63==And take the great-grown traitor unawares.
==64==Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.

*Exeunt.*
