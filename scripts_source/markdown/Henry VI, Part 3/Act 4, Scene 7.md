## Act 4, Scene 7
[[Act 4, Scene 6|← Act 4, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 8|Act 4, Scene 8 →]]

*Before York.*

*Flourish. Enter King Edward, Richard of Gloucester, Hastings, and Soldiers, a troop of Hollanders.*

**K. EDW.**
==1==Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
==2==Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
==3==And says that once more I shall interchange
==4==My waned state for Henry’s regal crown.
==5==Well have we pass’d and now repass’d the seas,
==6==And brought desired help from Burgundy.
==7==What then remains, we being thus arriv’d
==8==From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
==9==But that we enter as into our dukedom?

**GLOU.**
==10==The gates made fast? Brother, I like not this;
==11==For many men that stumble at the threshold
==12==Are well foretold that danger lurks within.

**K. EDW.**
==13==Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us.
==14==By fair or foul means we must enter in,
==15==For hither will our friends repair to us.

**HAST.**
==16==My liege, I’ll knock once more to summon them.

*Enter on the walls the Mayor of York and his brethren the Aldermen.*

**MAY.**
==17==My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
==18==And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
==19==For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.

**K. EDW.**
==20==But, Master Mayor, if Henry be your king,
==21==Yet Edward, at the least, is Duke of York.

**MAY.**
==22==True, my good lord, I know you for no less.

**K. EDW.**
==23==Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
==24==As being well content with that alone.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside.)*
==25==But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
==26==He’ll soon find means to make the body follow.

**HAST.**
==27==Why, Master Mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
==28==Open the gates, we are King Henry’s friends.

**MAY.**
==29==Ay, say you so? The gates shall then be opened.

*He descends with the Aldermen.*

**GLOU.**
==30==A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!

**HAST.**
==31==The good old man would fain that all were well,
==32==So ’twere not long of him; but being ent’red,
==33==I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
==34==Both him and all his brothers unto reason.

*Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen below.*

**K. EDW.**
==35==So, Master Mayor; these gates must not be shut,
==36==But in the night, or in the time of war.
==37==What, fear not, man, but yield me up the keys,
*(Takes his keys.)*
==38==For Edward will defend the town and thee,
==39==And all those friends that deign to follow me.

*March. Enter Montgomery with Drum and Soldiers.*

**GLOU.**
==40==Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
==41==Our trusty friend, unless I be deceiv’d.

**K. EDW.**
==42==Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?

**MONTG.**
==43==To help King Edward in his time of storm,
==44==As every loyal subject ought to do.

**K. EDW.**
==45==Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
==46==Our title to the crown, and only claim
==47==Our dukedom, till God please to send the rest.

**MONTG.**
==48==Then fare you well, for I will hence again,
==49==I came to serve a king and not a duke.
==50==Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.

*The Drum begins to march.*

**K. EDW.**
==51==Nay, stay, Sir John, a while, and we’ll debate
==52==By what safe means the crown may be recover’d.

**MONTG.**
==53==What talk you of debating? In few words,
==54==If you’ll not here proclaim yourself our king,
==55==I’ll leave you to your fortune, and be gone
==56==To keep them back that come to succor you.
==57==Why shall we fight if you pretend no title?

**GLOU.**
==58==Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?

**K. EDW.**
==59==When we grow stronger, then we’ll make our claim;
==60==Till then, ’tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.

**HAST.**
==61==Away with scrupulous wit! Now arms must rule.

**GLOU.**
==62==And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
==63==Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand,
==64==The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.

**K. EDW.**
==65==Then be it as you will; for ’tis my right,
==66==And Henry but usurps the diadem.

**MONTG.**
==67==Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself,
==68==And now will I be Edward’s champion.

**HAST.**
==69==Sound trumpet, Edward shall be here proclaim’d.
==70==Come, fellow soldier, make thou proclamation.

*Gives him a paper. Flourish. Sound.*

**YORK. SOLD.**
*(Reads.)*
==71==*“Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, etc.”*

**MONTG.**
==72==And whosoe’er gainsays King Edward’s right,
==73==By this I challenge him to single fight.

*Throws down his gauntlet.*

**ALL.**
==74==Long live Edward the Fourth!

**K. EDW.**
==75==Thanks, brave Montgomery, and thanks unto you all.
==76==If fortune serve me, I’ll requite this kindness.
==77==Now for this night, let’s harbor here in York;
==78==And when the morning sun shall raise his car
==79==Above the border of this horizon,
==80==We’ll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
==81==For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
==82==Ah, froward Clarence, how evil it beseems thee
==83==To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
==84==Yet as we may, we’ll meet both thee and Warwick.
==85==Come on, brave soldiers; doubt not of the day,
==86==And that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.

*Exeunt.*
