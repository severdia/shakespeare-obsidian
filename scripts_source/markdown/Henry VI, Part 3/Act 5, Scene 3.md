## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Another part of the battlefield near Barnet.*

*Flourish. Enter King Edward in triumph, with Richard of Gloucester, Clarence, and the rest.*

**K. EDW.**
==1==Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
==2==And we are grac’d with wreaths of victory.
==3==But in the midst of this bright-shining day,
==4==I spy a black, suspicious, threat’ning cloud,
==5==That will encounter with our glorious sun,
==6==Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
==7==I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen
==8==Hath rais’d in Gallia have arriv’d our coast,
==9==And as we hear, march on to fight with us.

**CLAR.**
==10==A little gale will soon disperse that cloud,
==11==And blow it to the source from whence it came;
==12==Thy very beams will dry those vapors up,
==13==For every cloud engenders not a storm.

**GLOU.**
==14==The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
==15==And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her;
==16==If she have time to breathe, be well assur’d
==17==Her faction will be full as strong as ours.

**K. EDW.**
==18==We are advertis’d by our loving friends
==19==That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury.
==20==We, having now the best at Barnet field,
==21==Will thither straight, for willingness rids way,
==22==And as we march, our strength will be augmented
==23==In every county as we go along.
==24==Strike up the drum, cry “Courage!” and away.

*Exeunt.*
