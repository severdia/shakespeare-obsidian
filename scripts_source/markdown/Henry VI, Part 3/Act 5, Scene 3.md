## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Another part of the battlefield near Barnet.*

*Flourish. Enter King Edward in triumph, with Richard of Gloucester, Clarence, and the rest.*

**K. EDW.**
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,
And we are grac’d with wreaths of victory.
But in the midst of this bright-shining day,
I spy a black, suspicious, threat’ning cloud,
That will encounter with our glorious sun,
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
I mean, my lords, those powers that the Queen
Hath rais’d in Gallia have arriv’d our coast,
And as we hear, march on to fight with us.

**CLAR.**
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud,
And blow it to the source from whence it came;
Thy very beams will dry those vapors up,
For every cloud engenders not a storm.

**GLOU.**
The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
And Somerset, with Oxford, fled to her;
If she have time to breathe, be well assur’d
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.

**K. EDW.**
We are advertis’d by our loving friends
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury.
We, having now the best at Barnet field,
Will thither straight, for willingness rids way,
And as we march, our strength will be augmented
In every county as we go along.
Strike up the drum, cry “Courage!” and away.

*Exeunt.*
