## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A plain in Warwickshire.*

*Enter Warwick and Oxford in England, with French Soldiers.*

**WAR.**
==1== Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well,
==2== The common people by numbers swarm to us.
*(Enter Clarence and Somerset.)*
==3== But see where Somerset and Clarence comes!
==4== Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?

**CLAR.**
==5== Fear not that, my lord.

**WAR.**
==6== Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick,
==7== And welcome, Somerset! I hold it cowardice
==8== To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
==9== Hath pawn’d an open hand in sign of love;
==10== Else might I think that Clarence, Edward’s brother,
==11== Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings.
==12== But welcome, sweet Clarence, my daughter shall be thine.
==13== And now what rests but, in night’s coverture,
==14== Thy brother being carelessly encamp’d,
==15== His soldiers lurking in the town about,
==16== And but attended by a simple guard,
==17== We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
==18== Our scouts have found the adventure very easy;
==19== That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
==20== With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus’ tents
==21== And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
==22== So we, well cover’d with the night’s black mantle,
==23== At unawares may beat down Edward’s guard,
==24== And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
==25== For I intend but only to surprise him.
==26== You that will follow me to this attempt,
==27== Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
*(They all cry, “Henry!” )*
==28== Why then, let’s on our way in silent sort.
==29== For Warwick and his friends, God and Saint George!

*Exeunt.*
