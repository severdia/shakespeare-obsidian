## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*London. A palace room.*

*Enter Richard of Gloucester, Clarence, Somerset, and Montague.*

**GLOU.**
==1==Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
==2==Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
==3==Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?

**CLAR.**
==4==Alas, you know, ’tis far from hence to France;
==5==How could he stay till Warwick made return?

**D. SOM.**
==6==My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the King.

*Flourish. Enter King Edward, Lady Grey, now Queen Elizabeth, Pembroke, Stafford, Hastings, and others. Four stand on one side and four on the other.*

**GLOU.**
==7==And his well-chosen bride.

**CLAR.**
==8==I mind to tell him plainly what I think.

**K. EDW.**
==9==Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
==10==That you stand pensive as half malcontent?

**CLAR.**
==11==As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick,
==12==Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
==13==That they’ll take no offense at our abuse.

**K. EDW.**
==14==Suppose they take offense without a cause;
==15==They are but Lewis and Warwick, I am Edward,
==16==Your king and Warwick’s, and must have my will.

**GLOU.**
==17==And shall have your will, because our king.
==18==Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.

**K. EDW.**
==19==Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?

**GLOU.**
==20==Not I.
==21==No; God forbid that I should wish them sever’d
==22==Whom God hath join’d together; ay, and ’twere pity
==23==To sunder them that yoke so well together.

**K. EDW.**
==24==Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
==25==Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
==26==Should not become my wife and England’s queen.
==27==And you too, Somerset and Montague,
==28==Speak freely what you think.

**CLAR.**
==29==Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
==30==Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
==31==About the marriage of the Lady Bona.

**GLOU.**
==32==And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
==33==Is now dishonored by this new marriage.

**K. EDW.**
==34==What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas’d
==35==By such invention as I can devise?

**MONT.**
==36==Yet, to have join’d with France in such alliance
==37==Would more have strength’ned this our commonwealth
==38==’Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.

**HAST.**
==39==Why, knows not Montague that of itself
==40==England is safe, if true within itself?

**MONT.**
==41==But the safer when ’tis back’d with France.

**HAST.**
==42==’Tis better using France than trusting France.
==43==Let us be back’d with God, and with the seas,
==44==Which he hath giv’n for fence impregnable,
==45==And with their helps only defend ourselves:
==46==In them, and in ourselves, our safety lies.

**CLAR.**
==47==For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
==48==To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.

**K. EDW.**
==49==Ay, what of that? It was my will and grant,
==50==And for this once my will shall stand for law.

**GLOU.**
==51==And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well
==52==To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
==53==Unto the brother of your loving bride.
==54==She better would have fitted me or Clarence;
==55==But in your bride you bury brotherhood.

**CLAR.**
==56==Or else you would not have bestow’d the heir
==57==Of the Lord Bonville on your new wive’s son,
==58==And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.

**K. EDW.**
==59==Alas, poor Clarence! Is it for a wife
==60==That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.

**CLAR.**
==61==In choosing for yourself, you show’d your judgment;
==62==Which being shallow, you shall give me leave
==63==To play the broker in mine own behalf;
==64==And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.

**K. EDW.**
==65==Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
==66==And not be tied unto his brother’s will.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==67==My lords, before it pleas’d his Majesty
==68==To raise my state to title of a queen,
==69==Do me but right, and you must all confess
==70==That I was not ignoble of descent,
==71==And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
==72==But as this title honors me and mine,
==73==So your dislikes, to whom I would be pleasing,
==74==Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.

**K. EDW.**
==75==My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns.
==76==What danger or what sorrow can befall thee
==77==So long as Edward is thy constant friend
==78==And their true sovereign whom they must obey?
==79==Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
==80==Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
==81==Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
==82==And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside.)*
==83==I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.

*Enter a Post.*

**K. EDW.**
==84==Now, messenger, what letters or what news
==85==From France?

**POST.**
==86==My sovereign liege, no letters, and few words,
==87==But such as I (without your special pardon) 
==88==Dare not relate.

**K. EDW.**
==89==Go to, we pardon thee; therefore, in brief,
==90==Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
==91==What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?

**POST.**
==92==At my depart, these were his very words:
==93==“Go tell false Edward, the supposed king,
==94==That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
==95==To revel it with him and his new bride.”

**K. EDW.**
==96==Is Lewis so brave? Belike he thinks me Henry.
==97==But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?

**POST.**
==98==These were her words, utt’red with mild disdain:
==99==“Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,
==100==I’ll wear the willow garland for his sake.”

**K. EDW.**
==101==I blame not her: she could say little less;
==102==She had the wrong. But what said Henry’s queen?
==103==For I have heard that she was there in place.

**POST.**
==104==“Tell him,” quoth she, “my mourning weeds are done,
==105==And I am ready to put armor on.”

**K. EDW.**
==106==Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
==107==But what said Warwick to these injuries?

**POST.**
==108==He, more incens’d against your Majesty
==109==Than all the rest, discharg’d me with these words:
==110==“Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
==111==And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere’t be long.”

**K. EDW.**
==112==Ha? Durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
==113==Well, I will arm me, being thus forewarn’d.
==114==They shall have wars, and pay for their presumption.
==115==But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?

**POST.**
==116==Ay, gracious sovereign, they are so link’d in friendship
==117==That young Prince Edward marries Warwick’s daughter.

**CLAR.**
==118==Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
==119==Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
==120==For I will hence to Warwick’s other daughter,
==121==That though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
==122==I may not prove inferior to yourself.
==123==You that love me and Warwick, follow me.

*Exit Clarence, and Somerset follow.*

**GLOU.**
*(Aside.)*
==124==Not I;
==125==My thoughts aim at a further matter: I
==126==Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.

**K. EDW.**
==127==Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick?
==128==Yet am I arm’d against the worst can happen;
==129==And haste is needful in this desp’rate case.
==130==Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
==131==Go levy men, and make prepare for war;
==132==They are already or quickly will be landed.
==133==Myself in person will straight follow you.
*(Exeunt Pembroke and Stafford.)*
==134==But ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
==135==Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
==136==Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
==137==Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
==138==If it be so, then both depart to him;
==139==I rather wish you foes than hollow friends.
==140==But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
==141==Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
==142==That I may never have you in suspect.

**MONT.**
==143==So God help Montague as he proves true!

**HAST.**
==144==And Hastings as he favors Edward’s cause!

**K. EDW.**
==145==Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?

**GLOU.**
==146==Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.

**K. EDW.**
==147==Why, so! Then am I sure of victory.
==148==Now therefore let us hence, and lose no hour,
==149==Till we meet Warwick with his foreign pow’r.

*Exeunt.*
