## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*A battlefield near Barnet.*

*Alarum and excursions. Enter King Edward, bringing forth Warwick wounded.*

**K. EDW.**
==1== So, lie thou there. Die thou, and die our fear,
==2== For Warwick was a bug that fear’d us all.
==3== Now, Montague, sit fast, I seek for thee,
==4== That Warwick’s bones may keep thine company.

*Exit.*

**WAR.**
==5== Ah, who is nigh? Come to me, friend or foe,
==6== And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
==7== Why ask I that? My mangled body shows,
==8== My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows,
==9== That I must yield my body to the earth,
==10== And by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
==11== Thus yields the cedar to the axe’s edge,
==12== Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
==13== Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
==14== Whose top-branch overpeer’d Jove’s spreading tree,
==15== And kept low shrubs from winter’s pow’rful wind.
==16== These eyes, that now are dimm’d with death’s black veil,
==17== Have been as piercing as the midday sun
==18== To search the secret treasons of the world.
==19== The wrinkles in my brows, now fill’d with blood,
==20== Were lik’ned oft to kingly sepulchres;
==21== For who liv’d king, but I could dig his grave?
==22== And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?
==23== Lo, now my glory smear’d in dust and blood!
==24== My parks, my walks, my manors that I had,
==25== Even now forsake me; and of all my lands
==26== Is nothing left me but my body’s length.
==27== Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
==28== And live we how we can, yet die we must.

*Enter Oxford and Somerset.*

**D. SOM.**
==29== Ah, Warwick, Warwick, wert thou as we are,
==30== We might recover all our loss again.
==31== The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power;
==32== Even now we heard the news. Ah, couldst thou fly!

**WAR.**
==33== Why then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
==34== If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand,
==35== And with thy lips keep in my soul a while.
==36== Thou lov’st me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
==37== Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
==38== That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
==39== Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.

**D. SOM.**
==40== Ah, Warwick, Montague hath breath’d his last,
==41== And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
==42== And said, “Commend me to my valiant brother.”
==43== And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
==44== Which sounded like a cannon in a vault,
==45== That mought not be distinguish’d; but at last
==46== I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
==47== “O, farewell, Warwick!”

**WAR.**
==48== Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves,
==49== For Warwick bids you all farewell, to meet in heaven.

*He dies.*

**OXF.**
==50== Away, away, to meet the Queen’s great power!

*Here they bear away his body. Exeunt.*
