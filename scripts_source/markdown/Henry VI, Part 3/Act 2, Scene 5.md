## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Yorkshire. Another part of the battlefield between Towton and Saxton.*

*Alarum. Enter King Henry alone.*

**KING.**
==1==This battle fares like to the morning’s war,
==2==When dying clouds contend with growing light,
==3==What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
==4==Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
==5==Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
==6==Forc’d by the tide to combat with the wind;
==7==Now sways it that way, like the self-same sea
==8==Forc’d to retire by fury of the wind.
==9==Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
==10==Now one the better, then another best;
==11==Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
==12==Yet neither conqueror nor conquered;
==13==So is the equal poise of this fell war.
==14==Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
==15==To whom God will, there be the victory!
==16==For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
==17==Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
==18==They prosper best of all when I am thence.
==19==Would I were dead, if God’s good will were so;
==20==For what is in this world but grief and woe?
==21==O God! Methinks it were a happy life
==22==To be no better than a homely swain,
==23==To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
==24==To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
==25==Thereby to see the minutes how they run:
==26==How many makes the hour full complete,
==27==How many hours brings about the day,
==28==How many days will finish up the year,
==29==How many years a mortal man may live.
==30==When this is known, then to divide the times:
==31==So many hours must I tend my flock,
==32==So many hours must I take my rest,
==33==So many hours must I contemplate,
==34==So many hours must I sport myself,
==35==So many days my ewes have been with young,
==36==So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean,
==37==So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
==38==So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
==39==Pass’d over to the end they were created,
==40==Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
==41==Ah! What a life were this! How sweet! How lovely!
==42==Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
==43==To shepherds looking on their silly sheep
==44==Than doth a rich embroider’d canopy
==45==To kings that fear their subjects’ treachery?
==46==O yes, it doth; a thousandfold it doth.
==47==And to conclude, the shepherd’s homely curds,
==48==His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,
==49==His wonted sleep under a fresh tree’s shade,
==50==All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
==51==Is far beyond a prince’s delicates⁠—
==52==His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
==53==His body couched in a curious bed,
==54==When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

*Alarum. Enter A Son That Has Killed His Father, at one door, dragging in the dead body.*

**SON.**
==55==Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
==56==This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight
==57==May be possessed with some store of crowns,
==58==And I that, haply, take them from him now,
==59==May yet, ere night, yield both my life and them
==60==To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
==61==Who’s this? O God! It is my father’s face,
==62==Whom in this conflict I, unwares, have kill’d.
==63==O heavy times, begetting such events!
==64==From London by the King was I press’d forth;
==65==My father, being the Earl of Warwick’s man,
==66==Came on the part of York, press’d by his master;
==67==And I, who at his hands receiv’d my life,
==68==Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
==69==Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
==70==And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
==71==My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
==72==And no more words till they have flow’d their fill.

**KING.**
==73==O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
==74==Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
==75==Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
==76==Weep, wretched man; I’ll aid thee tear for tear,
==77==And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
==78==Be blind with tears, and break o’ercharg’d with grief.

*Enter A Father That Has Killed His Son, at another door, bearing of his son.*

**FATH.**
==79==Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me,
==80==Give me thy gold—if thou hast any gold⁠—
==81==For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
==82==But let me see: is this our foeman’s face?
==83==Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
==84==Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
==85==Throw up thine eye! See, see what show’rs arise,
==86==Blown with the windy tempest of my heart
==87==Upon thy wounds, that kills mine eye and heart!
==88==O, pity, God, this miserable age!
==89==What stratagems! How fell! How butcherly!
==90==Erroneous, mutinous, and unnatural,
==91==This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
==92==O boy! Thy father gave thee life too soon,
==93==And hath bereft thee of thy life too late.

**KING.**
==94==Woe above woe! Grief more than common grief!
==95==O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
==96==O, pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
==97==The red rose and the white are on his face,
==98==The fatal colors of our striving houses;
==99==The one his purple blood right well resembles,
==100==The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth.
==101==Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;
==102==If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.

**SON.**
==103==How will my mother for a father’s death
==104==Take on with me, and ne’er be satisfied!

**FATH.**
==105==How will my wife for slaughter of my son
==106==Shed seas of tears, and ne’er be satisfied!

**KING.**
==107==How will the country for these woeful chances
==108==Misthink the King, and not be satisfied!

**SON.**
==109==Was ever son so ru’d a father’s death?

**FATH.**
==110==Was ever father so bemoan’d his son?

**KING.**
==111==Was ever king so griev’d for subjects’ woe?
==112==Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.

**SON.**
==113==I’ll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.

*Exit with his father.*

**FATH.**
==114==These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
==115==My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulcher,
==116==For from my heart thine image ne’er shall go;
==117==My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
==118==And so obsequious will thy father be,
==119==E’en for the loss of thee, having no more,
==120==As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
==121==I’ll bear thee hence, and let them fight that will,
==122==For I have murdered where I should not kill.

*Exit with his son.*

**KING.**
==123==Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,
==124==Here sits a king more woeful than you are.

*Alarums. Excursions. Enter the Queen Margaret, the Prince Edward, and Exeter.*

**PRINCE.**
==125==Fly, father, fly! For all your friends are fled,
==126==And Warwick rages like a chafed bull.
==127==Away! For death doth hold us in pursuit.

**Q. MARG.**
==128==Mount you, my lord, towards Berwick post amain.
==129==Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
==130==Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
==131==With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
==132==And bloody steel grasp’d in their ireful hands,
==133==Are at our backs, and therefore hence amain.

**EXE.**
==134==Away! For vengeance comes along with them.
==135==Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed,
==136==Or else come after. I’ll away before.

**KING.**
==137==Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter;
==138==Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
==139==Whither the Queen intends. Forward, away!

*Exeunt.*
