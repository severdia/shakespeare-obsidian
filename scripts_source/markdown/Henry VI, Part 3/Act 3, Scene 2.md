## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*London. A palace room.*

*Enter King Edward, Gloucester, Clarence, Lady Grey.*

**K. EDW.**
==1==Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Albans field
==2==This lady’s husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
==3==His land then seiz’d on by the conqueror.
==4==Her suit is now to repossess those lands,
==5==Which we in justice cannot well deny,
==6==Because in quarrel of the house of York
==7==The worthy gentleman did lose his life.

**GLOU.**
==8==Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit;
==9==It were dishonor to deny it her.

**K. EDW.**
==10==It were no less, but yet I’ll make a pause.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==11==Yea, is it so?
==12==I see the lady hath a thing to grant,
==13==Before the King will grant her humble suit.

**CLAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==14==He knows the game; how true he keeps the wind!

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==15==Silence!

**K. EDW.**
==16==Widow, we will consider of your suit,
==17==And come some other time to know our mind.

**L. GREY.**
==18==Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay.
==19==May it please your Highness to resolve me now,
==20==And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==21==Ay, widow? Then I’ll warrant you all your lands,
==22==And if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
==23==Fight closer or, good faith, you’ll catch a blow.

**CLAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==24==I fear her not, unless she chance to fall.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==25==God forbid that, for he’ll take vantages.

**K. EDW.**
==26==How many children hast thou, widow? Tell me.

**CLAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==27==I think he means to beg a child of her.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==28==Nay then whip me; he’ll rather give her two.

**L. GREY.**
==29==Three, my most gracious lord.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==30==You shall have four and you’ll be rul’d by him.

**K. EDW.**
==31==’Twere pity they should lose their father’s lands.

**L. GREY.**
==32==Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.

**K. EDW.**
==33==Lords, give us leave. I’ll try this widow’s wit.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==34==Ay, good leave have you, for you will have leave
==35==Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.

*Gloucester and Clarence retire.*

**K. EDW.**
==36==Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?

**L. GREY.**
==37==Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.

**K. EDW.**
==38==And would you not do much to do them good?

**L. GREY.**
==39==To do them good I would sustain some harm.

**K. EDW.**
==40==Then get your husband’s lands, to do them good.

**L. GREY.**
==41==Therefore I came unto your Majesty.

**K. EDW.**
==42==I’ll tell you how these lands are to be got.

**L. GREY.**
==43==So shall you bind me to your Highness’ service.

**K. EDW.**
==44==What service wilt thou do me if I give them?

**L. GREY.**
==45==What you command that rests in me to do.

**K. EDW.**
==46==But you will take exceptions to my boon.

**L. GREY.**
==47==No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.

**K. EDW.**
==48==Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.

**L. GREY.**
==49==Why then I will do what your Grace commands.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==50==He plies her hard, and much rain wears the marble.

**CLAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==51==As red as fire? Nay then, her wax must melt.

**L. GREY.**
==52==Why stops my lord? Shall I not hear my task?

**K. EDW.**
==53==An easy task, ’tis but to love a king.

**L. GREY.**
==54==That’s soon perform’d, because I am a subject.

**K. EDW.**
==55==Why then, thy husband’s lands I freely give thee.

**L. GREY.**
==56==I take my leave with many thousand thanks.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==57==The match is made, she seals it with a cur’sy.

**K. EDW.**
==58==But stay thee, ’tis the fruits of love I mean.

**L. GREY.**
==59==The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.

**K. EDW.**
==60==Ay, but I fear me in another sense.
==61==What love, think’st thou, I sue so much to get?

**L. GREY.**
==62==My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers⁠—
==63==That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.

**K. EDW.**
==64==No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.

**L. GREY.**
==65==Why then you mean not as I thought you did.

**K. EDW.**
==66==But now you partly may perceive my mind.

**L. GREY.**
==67==My mind will never grant what I perceive
==68==Your Highness aims at, if I aim aright.

**K. EDW.**
==69==To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.

**L. GREY.**
==70==To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.

**K. EDW.**
==71==Why then thou shalt not have thy husband’s lands.

**L. GREY.**
==72==Why then mine honesty shall be my dower,
==73==For by that loss I will not purchase them.

**K. EDW.**
==74==Therein thou wrong’st thy children mightily.

**L. GREY.**
==75==Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me.
==76==But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
==77==Accords not with the sadness of my suit.
==78==Please you dismiss me, either with ay or no.

**K. EDW.**
==79==Ay, if thou wilt say ay to my request;
==80==No, if thou dost say no to my demand.

**L. GREY.**
==81==Then no, my lord. My suit is at an end.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==82==The widow likes him not, she knits her brows.

**CLAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==83==He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom.

**K. EDW.**
*(Aside.)*
==84==Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty,
==85==Her words doth show her wit incomparable,
==86==All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
==87==One way or other, she is for a king,
==88==And she shall be my love or else my queen.⁠—
==89==Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?

**L. GREY.**
==90==’Tis better said than done, my gracious lord.
==91==I am a subject fit to jest withal,
==92==But far unfit to be a sovereign.

**K. EDW.**
==93==Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
==94==I speak no more than what my soul intends,
==95==And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.

**L. GREY.**
==96==And that is more than I will yield unto.
==97==I know I am too mean to be your queen,
==98==And yet too good to be your concubine.

**K. EDW.**
==99==You cavil, widow, I did mean my queen.

**L. GREY.**
==100==’Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father.

**K. EDW.**
==101==No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
==102==Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children,
==103==And by God’s Mother, I, being but a bachelor,
==104==Have other some. Why, ’tis a happy thing
==105==To be the father unto many sons.
==106==Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Clarence.)*
==107==The ghostly father now hath done his shrift.

**CLAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==108==When he was made a shriver, ’twas for shift.

**K. EDW.**
==109==Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.

**GLOU.**
==110==The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.

**K. EDW.**
==111==You’ld think it strange if I should marry her.

**CLAR.**
==112==To who, my lord?

**K. EDW.**
==112==           Why, Clarence, to myself.

**GLOU.**
==113==That would be ten days’ wonder at the least.

**CLAR.**
==114==That’s a day longer than a wonder lasts.

**GLOU.**
==115==By so much is the wonder in extremes.

**K. EDW.**
==116==Well, jest on, brothers. I can tell you both
==117==Her suit is granted for her husband’s lands.

*Enter a Nobleman.*

**NOB.**
==118==My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
==119==And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.

**K. EDW.**
==120==See that he be convey’d unto the Tower;
==121==And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
==122==To question of his apprehension.
==123==Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honorably.

*Exeunt. Manet Richard of Gloucester.*

**GLOU.**
==124==Ay, Edward will use women honorably.
==125==Would he were wasted, marrow, bones, and all,
==126==That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
==127==To cross me from the golden time I look for!
==128==And yet, between my soul’s desire and me⁠—
==129==The lustful Edward’s title buried⁠—
==130==Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
==131==And all the unlook’d-for issue of their bodies
==132==To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
==133==A cold premeditation for my purpose!
==134==Why then I do but dream on sovereignty,
==135==Like one that stands upon a promontory
==136==And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
==137==Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
==138==And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
==139==Saying, he’ll lade it dry to have his way:
==140==So do I wish the crown, being so far off,
==141==And so I chide the means that keeps me from it,
==142==And so, I say, I’ll cut the causes off,
==143==Flattering me with impossibilities.
==144==My eye’s too quick, my heart o’erweens too much,
==145==Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
==146==Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
==147==What other pleasure can the world afford?
==148==I’ll make my heaven in a lady’s lap,
==149==And deck my body in gay ornaments,
==150==And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
==151==O miserable thought! And more unlikely
==152==Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
==153==Why, love forswore me in my mother’s womb;
==154==And for I should not deal in her soft laws,
==155==She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
==156==To shrink mine arm up like a wither’d shrub,
==157==To make an envious mountain on my back,
==158==Where sits deformity to mock my body;
==159==To shape my legs of an unequal size,
==160==To disproportion me in every part,
==161==Like to a chaos, or an unlick’d bear-whelp
==162==That carries no impression like the dam.
==163==And am I then a man to be belov’d?
==164==O monstrous fault, to harbor such a thought!
==165==Then since this earth affords no joy to me
==166==But to command, to check, to o’erbear such
==167==As are of better person than myself,
==168==I’ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
==169==And whiles I live, t’ account this world but hell,
==170==Until my misshap’d trunk that bears this head
==171==Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
==172==And yet I know not how to get the crown,
==173==For many lives stand between me and home;
==174==And I—like one lost in a thorny wood,
==175==That rents the thorns, and is rent with the thorns,
==176==Seeking a way, and straying from the way,
==177==Not knowing how to find the open air,
==178==But toiling desperately to find it out⁠—
==179==Torment myself to catch the English crown;
==180==And from that torment I will free myself,
==181==Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
==182==Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
==183==And cry “Content” to that which grieves my heart,
==184==And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
==185==And frame my face to all occasions.
==186==I’ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall,
==187==I’ll slay more gazers than the basilisk,
==188==I’ll play the orator as well as Nestor,
==189==Deceive more slyly than Ulysses could,
==190==And like a Sinon, take another Troy.
==191==I can add colors to the chameleon,
==192==Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
==193==And set the murderous Machevil to school.
==194==Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
==195==Tut, were it farther off, I’ll pluck it down.

*Exit.*
