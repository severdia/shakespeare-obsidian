## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*London. A palace room.*

*Enter Rivers and Lady Grey, now Queen Elizabeth.*

**RIV.**
==1==Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==2==Why, brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
==3==What late misfortune is befall’n King Edward?

**RIV.**
==4==What? Loss of some pitch’d battle against Warwick?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==5==No, but the loss of his own royal person.

**RIV.**
==6==Then is my sovereign slain?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==7==Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
==8==Either betray’d by falsehood of his guard
==9==Or by his foe surpris’d at unawares;
==10==And as I further have to understand,
==11==Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
==12==Fell Warwick’s brother, and by that our foe.

**RIV.**
==13==These news I must confess are full of grief,
==14==Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
==15==Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.

**Q. ELIZ.**
==16==Till then fair hope must hinder live’s decay;
==17==And I the rather wain me from despair
==18==For love of Edward’s offspring in my womb.
==19==This is it that makes me bridle passion,
==20==And bear with mildness my misfortune’s cross;
==21==Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear,
==22==And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
==23==Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
==24==King Edward’s fruit, true heir to th’ English crown.

**RIV.**
==25==But, madam, where is Warwick then become?

**Q. ELIZ.**
==26==I am inform’d that he comes towards London
==27==To set the crown once more on Henry’s head.
==28==Guess thou the rest; King Edward’s friends must down.
==29==But to prevent the tyrant’s violence
==30==(For trust not him that hath once broken faith),
==31==I’ll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
==32==To save, at least, the heir of Edward’s right;
==33==There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
==34==Come therefore, let us fly while we may fly,
==35==If Warwick take us we are sure to die.

*Exeunt.*
