## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Yorkshire. A room in Sandal Castle.*

*Enter Richard, Edward, and Montague.*

**RICH.**
==1==Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.

**EDW.**
==2==No, I can better play the orator.

**MONT.**
==3==But I have reasons strong and forcible.

*Enter the Duke of York.*

**YORK.**
==4==Why, how now, sons and brother, at a strife?
==5==What is your quarrel? How began it first?

**EDW.**
==6==No quarrel, but a slight contention.

**YORK.**
==7==About what?

**RICH.**
==8==About that which concerns your Grace and us:
==9==The crown of England, father, which is yours.

**YORK.**
==10==Mine, boys? Not till King Henry be dead.

**RICH.**
==11==Your right depends not on his life or death.

**EDW.**
==12==Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now.
==13==By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
==14==It will outrun you, father, in the end.

**YORK.**
==15==I took an oath that he should quietly reign.

**EDW.**
==16==But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
==17==I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.

**RICH.**
==18==No; God forbid your Grace should be forsworn.

**YORK.**
==19==I shall be, if I claim by open war.

**RICH.**
==20==I’ll prove the contrary, if you’ll hear me speak.

**YORK.**
==21==Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.

**RICH.**
==22==An oath is of no moment, being not took
==23==Before a true and lawful magistrate
==24==That hath authority over him that swears.
==25==Henry had none, but did usurp the place.
==26==Then seeing ’twas he that made you to depose,
==27==Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
==28==Therefore to arms! And, father, do but think
==29==How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown,
==30==Within whose circuit is Elysium
==31==And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
==32==Why do we linger thus? I cannot rest
==33==Until the white rose that I wear be dy’d
==34==Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry’s heart.

**YORK.**
==35==Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
==36==Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
==37==And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
==38==Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
==39==And tell him privily of our intent.
==40==You, Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
==41==With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise;
==42==In them I trust, for they are soldiers,
==43==Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
==44==While you are thus employ’d, what resteth more,
==45==But that I seek occasion how to rise,
==46==And yet the King not privy to my drift,
==47==Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
*(Enter First Yorkist Messenger.)*
==48==But stay, what news? Why com’st thou in such post?

**1. YORK. MESS.**
==49==The Queen with all the northern earls and lords
==50==Intend here to besiege you in your castle.
==51==She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
==52==And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.

**YORK.**
==53==Ay, with my sword. What? Think’st thou that we fear them?
==54==Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me,
==55==My brother Montague shall post to London.
==56==Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
==57==Whom we have left protectors of the King,
==58==With pow’rful policy strengthen themselves,
==59==And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.

**MONT.**
==60==Brother, I go; I’ll win them, fear it not.
==61==And thus most humbly I do take my leave.

*Exit Montague.*

*Enter Sir John Mortimer and his brother Sir Hugh Mortimer.*

**YORK.**
==62==Sir John and Sir Hugh Mortimer, mine uncles,
==63==You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
==64==The army of the Queen mean to besiege us.

**SIR JOHN.**
==65==She shall not need, we’ll meet her in the field.

**YORK.**
==66==What, with five thousand men?

**RICH.**
==67==Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need.
==68==A woman’s general: what should we fear?

*A march afar off.*

**EDW.**
==69==I hear their drums. Let’s set our men in order,
==70==And issue forth and bid them battle straight.

**YORK.**
==71==Five men to twenty! Though the odds be great,
==72==I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
==73==Many a battle have I won in France
==74==When as the enemy hath been ten to one;
==75==Why should I not now have the like success?

*Alarum. Exeunt.*
