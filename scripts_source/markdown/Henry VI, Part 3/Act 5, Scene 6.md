## Act 5, Scene 6
[[Act 5, Scene 5|← Act 5, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 7|Act 5, Scene 7 →]]

*London. The Tower.*

*Enter Henry the Sixth and Richard of Gloucester with the Lieutenant, on the walls.*

**GLOU.**
==1== Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?

**KING.**
==2== Ay, my good lord—my lord, I should say rather.
==3== ’Tis sin to flatter, “good” was little better:
==4== ‘Good Gloucester’ and “good devil” were alike,
==5== And both preposterous; therefore, not “good lord.”

**GLOU.**
==6== Sirrah, leave us to ourselves, we must confer.

*Exit Lieutenant.*

**KING.**
==7== So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
==8== So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece,
==9== And next his throat unto the butcher’s knife.
==10== What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?

**GLOU.**
==11== Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
==12== The thief doth fear each bush an officer.

**KING.**
==13== The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
==14== With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
==15== And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
==16== Have now the fatal object in my eye
==17== Where my poor young was lim’d, was caught, and kill’d.

**GLOU.**
==18== Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete
==19== That taught his son the office of a fowl!
==20== And yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown’d.

**KING.**
==21== I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
==22== Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
==23== The sun that sear’d the wings of my sweet boy,
==24== Thy brother Edward; and thyself, the sea
==25== Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
==26== Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
==27== My breast can better brook thy dagger’s point
==28== Than can my ears that tragic history.
==29== But wherefore dost thou come? Is’t for my life?

**GLOU.**
==30== Think’st thou I am an executioner?

**KING.**
==31== A persecutor I am sure thou art.
==32== If murdering innocents be executing,
==33== Why then thou art an executioner.

**GLOU.**
==34== Thy son I kill’d for his presumption.

**KING.**
==35== Hadst thou been kill’d when first thou didst presume,
==36== Thou hadst not liv’d to kill a son of mine.
==37== And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand
==38== Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
==39== And many an old man’s sigh and many a widow’s,
==40== And many an orphan’s water-standing eye⁠—
==41== Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
==42== Orphans for their parents’ timeless death⁠—
==43== Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
==44== The owl shriek’d at thy birth, an evil sign;
==45== The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
==46== Dogs howl’d, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
==47== The raven rook’d her on the chimney’s top,
==48== And chatt’ring pies in dismal discords sung;
==49== Thy mother felt more than a mother’s pain,
==50== And yet brought forth less than a mother’s hope,
==51== To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
==52== Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
==53== Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
==54== To signify thou cam’st to bite the world;
==55== And if the rest be true which I have heard,
==56== Thou cam’st⁠—

**GLOU.**
==57== I’ll hear no more; die, prophet, in thy speech:
*(Stabs him.)*
==58== For this, amongst the rest, was I ordain’d.

**KING.**
==59== Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
==60== O God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!

*Dies.*

**GLOU.**
==61== What? Will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
==62== Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
==63== See how my sword weeps for the poor king’s death!
==64== O may such purple tears be alway shed
==65== From those that wish the downfall of our house!
==66== If any spark of life be yet remaining,
==67== Down, down to hell, and say I sent thee thither⁠—
*(Stabs him again.)*
==68== I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
==69== Indeed ’tis true that Henry told me of;
==70== For I have often heard my mother say
==71== I came into the world with my legs forward.
==72== Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
==73== And seek their ruin that usurp’d our right?
==74== The midwife wonder’d and the women cried,
==75== “O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!”
==76== And so I was, which plainly signified
==77== That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog.
==78== Then since the heavens have shap’d my body so,
==79== Let hell make crook’d my mind to answer it.
==80== I have no brother, I am like no brother;
==81== And this word “love,” which greybeards call divine,
==82== Be resident in men like one another,
==83== And not in me: I am myself alone.
==84== Clarence, beware! Thou keep’st me from the light,
==85== But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
==86== For I will buzz abroad such prophecies
==87== That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
==88== And then to purge his fear, I’ll be thy death.
==89== King Henry and the Prince his son are gone;
==90== Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
==91== Counting myself but bad till I be best.
==92== I’ll throw thy body in another room,
==93== And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.

*Exit with the body.*
