## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*France. A room in King Lewis XI’s palace.*

*Flourish. Enter Lewis the French King, his sister Lady Bona, his Admiral, call’d Bourbon, Prince Edward, Queen Margaret, and the Earl of Oxford.*

*Lewis sits, and riseth up again.*

**K. LEW.**
==1==Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
==2==Sit down with us. It ill befits thy state
==3==And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.

**Q. MARG.**
==4==No, mighty King of France; now Margaret
==5==Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve
==6==Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
==7==Great Albion’s queen in former golden days;
==8==But now mischance hath trod my title down,
==9==And with dishonor laid me on the ground,
==10==Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
==11==And to my humble seat conform myself.

**K. LEW.**
==12==Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?

**Q. MARG.**
==13==From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
==14==And stops my tongue, while heart is drown’d in cares.

**K. LEW.**
==15==What e’er it be, be thou still like thyself,
==16==And sit thee by our side.
*(Seats her by him.)*
==16==              Yield not thy neck
==17==To fortune’s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
==18==Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
==19==Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
==20==It shall be eas’d if France can yield relief.

**Q. MARG.**
==21==Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
==22==And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
==23==Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis,
==24==That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
==25==Is, of a king, become a banish’d man,
==26==And forc’d to live in Scotland a forlorn;
==27==While proud ambitious Edward, Duke of York,
==28==Usurps the regal title and the seat
==29==Of England’s true-anointed lawful king.
==30==This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
==31==With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry’s heir,
==32==Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
==33==And if thou fail us, all our hope is done.
==34==Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
==35==Our people and our peers are both misled,
==36==Our treasure seiz’d, our soldiers put to flight,
==37==And as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.

**K. LEW.**
==38==Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
==39==While we bethink a means to break it off.

**Q. MARG.**
==40==The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.

**K. LEW.**
==41==The more I stay, the more I’ll succor thee.

**Q. MARG.**
==42==O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
==43==And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!

*Enter Warwick.*

**K. LEW.**
==44==What’s he approacheth boldly to our presence?

**Q. MARG.**
==45==Our Earl of Warwick, Edward’s greatest friend.

**K. LEW.**
==46==Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?

*He descends. She ariseth.*

**Q. MARG.**
==47==Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,
==48==For this is he that moves both wind and tide.

**WAR.**
==49==From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
==50==My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend,
==51==I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
==52==First, to do greetings to thy royal person,
==53==And then to crave a league of amity,
==54==And lastly, to confirm that amity
==55==With nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
==56==That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
==57==To England’s king in lawful marriage.

**Q. MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==58==If that go forward, Henry’s hope is done.

**WAR.**
==59==And, gracious madam
*(Speaking to Lady Bona.)*
==59==              in our king’s behalf
==60==I am commanded, with your leave and favor,
==61==Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
==62==To tell the passion of my sovereign’s heart,
==63==Where fame, late ent’ring at his heedful ears,
==64==Hath plac’d thy beauty’s image and thy virtue.

**Q. MARG.**
==65==King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak
==66==Before you answer Warwick. His demand
==67==Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,
==68==But from deceit bred by necessity;
==69==For how can tyrants safely govern home,
==70==Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
==71==To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
==72==That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,
==73==Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son.
==74==Look therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
==75==Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor;
==76==For though usurpers sway the rule a while,
==77==Yet heav’ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.

**WAR.**
==78==Injurious Margaret!

**PRINCE.**
==78==           And why not Queen?

**WAR.**
==79==Because thy father Henry did usurp,
==80==And thou no more art prince than she is queen.

**OXF.**
==81==Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
==82==Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
==83==And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
==84==Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
==85==And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
==86==Who by his prowess conquered all France:
==87==From these our Henry lineally descends.

**WAR.**
==88==Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse
==89==You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
==90==All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten?
==91==Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
==92==But for the rest: you tell a pedigree
==93==Of threescore and two years—a silly time
==94==To make prescription for a kingdom’s worth.

**OXF.**
==95==Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
==96==Whom thou obey’dst thirty and six years,
==97==And not bewray thy treason with a blush?

**WAR.**
==98==Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
==99==Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
==100==For shame, leave Henry, and call Edward king.

**OXF.**
==101==Call him my king by whose injurious doom
==102==My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
==103==Was done to death? And more than so, my father,
==104==Even in the downfall of his mellow’d years,
==105==When nature brought him to the door of death?
==106==No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
==107==This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.

**WAR.**
==108==And I the house of York.

**K. LEW.**
==109==Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
==110==Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
==111==While I use further conference with Warwick.

*They stand aloof.*

**Q. MARG.**
==112==Heavens grant that Warwick’s words bewitch him not!

**K. LEW.**
==113==Now, Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
==114==Is Edward your true king? For I were loath
==115==To link with him that were not lawful chosen.

**WAR.**
==116==Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honor.

**K. LEW.**
==117==But is he gracious in the people’s eye?

**WAR.**
==118==The more that Henry was unfortunate.

**K. LEW.**
==119==Then further: all dissembling set aside,
==120==Tell me for truth the measure of his love
==121==Unto our sister Bona.

**WAR.**
==121==           Such it seems
==122==As may beseem a monarch like himself.
==123==Myself have often heard him say, and swear,
==124==That this his love was an eternal plant,
==125==Whereof the root was fix’d in virtue’s ground,
==126==The leaves and fruit maintain’d with beauty’s sun,
==127==Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
==128==Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.

**K. LEW.**
==129==Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.

**BONA.**
==130==Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine.
==131==Yet I confess that often ere this day,
*(Speaks to Warwick.)*
==132==When I have heard your king’s desert recounted,
==133==Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.

**K. LEW.**
==134==Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward’s.
==135==And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
==136==Touching the jointure that your king must make,
==137==Which with her dowry shall be counterpois’d.
==138==Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
==139==That Bona shall be wife to the English king.

**PRINCE.**
==140==To Edward, but not to the English king.

**Q. MARG.**
==141==Deceitful Warwick, it was thy device
==142==By this alliance to make void my suit.
==143==Before thy coming, Lewis was Henry’s friend.

**K. LEW.**
==144==And still is friend to him and Margaret.
==145==But if your title to the crown be weak,
==146==As may appear by Edward’s good success,
==147==Then ’tis but reason that I be releas’d
==148==From giving aid which late I promised.
==149==Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
==150==That your estate requires and mine can yield.

**WAR.**
==151==Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease;
==152==Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
==153==And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
==154==You have a father able to maintain you,
==155==And better ’twere you troubled him than France.

**Q. MARG.**
==156==Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick,
==157==Proud setter-up and puller-down of kings!
==158==I will not hence, till with my talk and tears
==159==(Both full of truth) I make King Lewis behold
==160==Thy sly conveyance and thy lord’s false love,
==161==For both of you are birds of self-same feather.

*Post blowing a horn within.*

**K. LEW.**
==162==Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.

*Enter the Post.*

**POST.**
==163==My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
*(Speaks to Warwick.)*
==164==Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague.
==165==These from our king unto your Majesty.
*(To Lewis.)*
==166==And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.

*To Margaret.*

*They all read their letters.*

**OXF.**
==167==I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
==168==Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.

**PRINCE.**
==169==Nay, mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled.
==170==I hope all’s for the best.

**K. LEW.**
==171==Warwick, what are thy news? And yours, fair queen?

**Q. MARG.**
==172==Mine such as fill my heart with unhop’d joys.

**WAR.**
==173==Mine full of sorrow and heart’s discontent.

**K. LEW.**
==174==What? Has your king married the Lady Grey?
==175==And now to soothe your forgery and his,
==176==Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
==177==Is this th’ alliance that he seeks with France?
==178==Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?

**Q. MARG.**
==179==I told your Majesty as much before:
==180==This proveth Edward’s love and Warwick’s honesty.

**WAR.**
==181==King Lewis, I here protest in sight of heaven,
==182==And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
==183==That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward’s;
==184==No more my king, for he dishonors me,
==185==But most himself if he could see his shame.
==186==Did I forget that by the house of York
==187==My father came untimely to his death?
==188==Did I let pass th’ abuse done to my niece?
==189==Did I impale him with the regal crown?
==190==Did I put Henry from his native right?
==191==And am I guerdon’d at the last with shame?
==192==Shame on himself! For my desert is honor;
==193==And to repair my honor lost for him,
==194==I here renounce him and return to Henry.
==195==My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
==196==And henceforth I am thy true servitor.
==197==I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
==198==And replant Henry in his former state.

**Q. MARG.**
==199==Warwick, these words have turn’d my hate to love,
==200==And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
==201==And joy that thou becom’st King Henry’s friend.

**WAR.**
==202==So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
==203==That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
==204==With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
==205==I’ll undertake to land them on our coast,
==206==And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
==207==’Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him,
==208==And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
==209==He’s very likely now to fall from him,
==210==For matching more for wanton lust than honor,
==211==Or than for strength and safety of our country.

**BONA.**
==212==Dear brother, how shall Bona be reveng’d
==213==But by thy help to this distressed queen?

**Q. MARG.**
==214==Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
==215==Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?

**BONA.**
==216==My quarrel and this English queen’s are one.

**WAR.**
==217==And mine, fair Lady Bona, joins with yours.

**K. LEW.**
==218==And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret’s.
==219==Therefore, at last, I firmly am resolv’d
==220==You shall have aid.

**Q. MARG.**
==221==Let me give humble thanks for all at once.

**K. LEW.**
==222==Then, England’s messenger, return in post,
==223==And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
==224==That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
==225==To revel it with him and his new bride.
==226==Thou seest what’s pass’d, go fear thy king withal.

**BONA.**
==227==Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,
==228==I wear the willow garland for his sake.

**Q. MARG.**
==229==Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
==230==And I am ready to put armor on.

**WAR.**
==231==Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
==232==And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere’t be long.
==233==There’s thy reward, be gone.

*Exit Post.*

**K. LEW.**
==233==                But, Warwick,
==234==Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
==235==Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle;
==236==And as occasion serves, this noble queen
==237==And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
==238==Yet ere thou go, but answer me one doubt:
==239==What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?

**WAR.**
==240==This shall assure my constant loyalty,
==241==That if our queen and this young prince agree,
==242==I’ll join mine eldest daughter, and my joy,
==243==To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.

**Q. MARG.**
==244==Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
==245==Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
==246==Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick,
==247==And with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable
==248==That only Warwick’s daughter shall be thine.

**PRINCE.**
==249==Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it,
==250==And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.

*He gives his hand to Warwick.*

**K. LEW.**
==251==Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
==252==And thou, Lord Bourbon, our High Admiral,
==253==Shall waft them over with our royal fleet.
==254==I long till Edward fall by war’s mischance,
==255==For mocking marriage with a dame of France.

*Exeunt. Manet Warwick.*

**WAR.**
==256==I came from Edward as ambassador,
==257==But I return his sworn and mortal foe.
==258==Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
==259==But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
==260==Had he none else to make a stale but me?
==261==Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
==262==I was the chief that rais’d him to the crown,
==263==And I’ll be chief to bring him down again;
==264==Not that I pity Henry’s misery,
==265==But seek revenge on Edward’s mockery.

*Exit.*
