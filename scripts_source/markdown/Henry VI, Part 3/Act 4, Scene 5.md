## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Yorkshire. A park near Middleham Castle.*

*Enter Richard of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and Sir William Stanley.*

**GLOU.**
==1==Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
==2==Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither
==3==Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
==4==Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
==5==Is prisoner to the Bishop here, at whose hands
==6==He hath good usage and great liberty,
==7==And often but attended with weak guard,
==8==Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
==9==I have advertis’d him by secret means
==10==That if about this hour he make this way,
==11==Under the color of his usual game,
==12==He shall here find his friends with horse and men
==13==To set him free from his captivity.

*Enter King Edward, and a Huntsman with him.*

**HUNT.**
==14==This way, my lord, for this way lies the game.

**K. EDW.**
==15==Nay, this way, man, see where the huntsmen stand.
==16==Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
==17==Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop’s deer?

**GLOU.**
==18==Brother, the time and case requireth haste,
==19==Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.

**K. EDW.**
==20==But whither shall we then?

**HAST.**
==20==              To Lynn, my lord⁠—
*(To Gloucester.)*
==21==And shipp’d from thence to Flanders?

**GLOU.**
==22==Well guess’d, believe me, for that was my meaning.

**K. EDW.**
==23==Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.

**GLOU.**
==24==But wherefore stay we? ’Tis no time to talk.

**K. EDW.**
==25==Huntsman, what say’st thou? Wilt thou go along?

**HUNT.**
==26==Better do so than tarry and be hang’d.

**GLOU.**
==27==Come then away, let’s ha’ no more ado.

**K. EDW.**
==28==Bishop, farewell! Shield thee from Warwick’s frown,
==29==And pray that I may repossess the crown.

*Exeunt.*
