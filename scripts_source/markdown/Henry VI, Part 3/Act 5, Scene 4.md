## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*Plains near Tewksbury.*

*Flourish. March. Enter the Queen Margaret, young Prince Edward, Somerset, Oxford, and Soldiers.*

**Q. MARG.**
==1== Great lords, wise men ne’er sit and wail their loss,
==2== But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
==3== What though the mast be now blown overboard,
==4== The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
==5== And half our sailors swallow’d in the flood?
==6== Yet lives our pilot still. Is’t meet that he
==7== Should leave the helm and, like a fearful lad,
==8== With tearful eyes add water to the sea,
==9== And give more strength to that which hath too much,
==10== Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
==11== Which industry and courage might have sav’d?
==12== Ah, what a shame, ah, what a fault were this!
==13== Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
==14== And Montague our topmast; what of him?
==15== Our slaught’red friends the tackles; what of these?
==16== Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
==17== And Somerset another goodly mast?
==18== The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
==19== And though unskillful, why not Ned and I
==20== For once allow’d the skillful pilot’s charge?
==21== We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
==22== But keep our course (though the rough wind say no) 
==23== From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wrack.
==24== As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
==25== And what is Edward but a ruthless sea?
==26== What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
==27== And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
==28== All these the enemies to our poor bark.
==29== Say you can swim, alas, ’tis but a while;
==30== Tread on the sand, why, there you quickly sink;
==31== Bestride the rock, the tide will wash you off,
==32== Or else you famish—that’s a threefold death.
==33== This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
==34== If case some one of you would fly from us,
==35== That there’s no hop’d-for mercy with the brothers
==36== More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
==37== Why, courage then! What cannot be avoided,
==38== ’Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.

**PRINCE.**
==39== Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
==40== Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
==41== Infuse his breast with magnanimity,
==42== And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
==43== I speak not this as doubting any here;
==44== For did I but suspect a fearful man,
==45== He should have leave to go away betimes,
==46== Lest in our need he might infect another,
==47== And make him of like spirit to himself.
==48== If any such be here—as God forbid!⁠—
==49== Let him depart before we need his help.

**OXF.**
==50== Women and children of so high a courage,
==51== And warriors faint! Why, ’twere perpetual shame.
==52== O brave young prince! Thy famous grandfather
==53== Doth live again in thee. Long mayst thou live
==54== To bear his image and renew his glories!

**D. SOM.**
==55== And he that will not fight for such a hope
==56== Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
==57== If he arise, be mock’d and wond’red at.

**Q. MARG.**
==58== Thanks, gentle Somerset, sweet Oxford, thanks.

**PRINCE.**
==59== And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.

*Enter Second Lancastrian Messenger.*

**2. LAN. MESS.**
==60== Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand,
==61== Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.

**OXF.**
==62== I thought no less; it is his policy
==63== To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.

**D. SOM.**
==64== But he’s deceiv’d, we are in readiness.

**Q. MARG.**
==65== This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.

**OXF.**
==66== Here pitch our battle, hence we will not budge.

*Flourish and march. Enter King Edward, Richard of Gloucester, Clarence, and Soldiers.*

**K. EDW.**
==67== Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
==68== Which by the heavens’ assistance and your strength,
==69== Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
==70== I need not add more fuel to your fire,
==71== For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out.
==72== Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!

**Q. MARG.**
==73== Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
==74== My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
==75== Ye see I drink the water of my eye.
==76== Therefore no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
==77== Is prisoner to the foe, his state usurp’d,
==78== His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
==79== His statutes cancell’d, and his treasure spent;
==80== And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
==81== You fight in justice; then in God’s name, lords,
==82== Be valiant, and give signal to the fight.

*Alarum to the battle. Retreat. King Edward, with his followers, flies. Excursions; the chambers be discharged.*

*Then enter King Edward, Clarence, Gloucester, and the rest of the King’s followers and make a great shout, and cry, “For York! For York!”.*

*Then Queen Margaret is taken, and Prince Edward and Oxford and Somerset.*

*Exeunt.*
