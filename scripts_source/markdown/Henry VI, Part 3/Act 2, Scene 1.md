## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Herfordshire. A plain near Mortimer’s Cross.*

*A march. Enter Edward, Richard, and their power.*

**EDW.**
==1==I wonder how our princely father scap’d;
==2==Or whether he be scap’d away or no
==3==From Clifford’s and Northumberland’s pursuit.
==4==Had he been ta’en, we should have heard the news;
==5==Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
==6==Or had he scap’d, methinks we should have heard
==7==The happy tidings of his good escape.
==8==How fares my brother? Why is he so sad?

**RICH.**
==9==I cannot joy, until I be resolv’d
==10==Where our right valiant father is become.
==11==I saw him in the battle range about,
==12==And watch’d him how he singled Clifford forth.
==13==Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
==14==As doth a lion in a herd of neat,
==15==Or as a bear, encompass’d round with dogs,
==16==Who having pinch’d a few and made them cry,
==17==The rest stand all aloof and bark at him.
==18==So far’d our father with his enemies,
==19==So fled his enemies my warlike father;
==20==Methinks ’tis prize enough to be his son.
*(Three suns appear in the air.)*
==21==See how the morning opes her golden gates,
==22==And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
==23==How well resembles it the prime of youth,
==24==Trimm’d like a younker prancing to his love!

**EDW.**
==25==Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

**RICH.**
==26==Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun,
==27==Not separated with the racking clouds,
==28==But sever’d in a pale clear-shining sky.
==29==See, see, they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
==30==As if they vow’d some league inviolable.
==31==Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
==32==In this the heaven figures some event.

**EDW.**
==33==’Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
==34==I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
==35==That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
==36==Each one already blazing by our meeds,
==37==Should notwithstanding join our lights together,
==38==And over-shine the earth as this the world.
==39==What e’er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
==40==Upon my target three fair shining suns.

**RICH.**
==41==Nay, bear three daughters; by your leave I speak it,
==42==You love the breeder better than the male.
*(Enter Second Yorkist Messenger blowing.)*
==43==But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
==44==Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?

**2. YORK. MESS.**
==45==Ah, one that was a woeful looker-on
==46==When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
==47==Your princely father and my loving lord!

**EDW.**
==48==O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.

**RICH.**
==49==Say how he died, for I will hear it all.

**2. YORK. MESS.**
==50==Environed he was with many foes,
==51==And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
==52==Against the Greeks that would have ent’red Troy.
==53==But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
==54==And many strokes, though with a little axe,
==55==Hews down and fells the hardest-timber’d oak.
==56==By many hands your father was subdu’d,
==57==But only slaught’red by the ireful arm
==58==Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen;
==59==Who crown’d the gracious Duke in high despite,
==60==Laugh’d in his face; and when with grief he wept,
==61==The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks
==62==A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
==63==Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain.
==64==And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
==65==They took his head, and on the gates of York
==66==They set the same, and there it doth remain,
==67==The saddest spectacle that e’er I view’d.

**EDW.**
==68==Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
==69==Now thou art gone we have no staff, no stay.
==70==O Clifford, boist’rous Clifford, thou hast slain
==71==The flow’r of Europe for his chevalry,
==72==And treacherously hast thou vanquish’d him,
==73==For hand to hand he would have vanquish’d thee.
==74==Now my soul’s palace is become a prison;
==75==Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
==76==Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
==77==For never henceforth shall I joy again,
==78==Never, O never, shall I see more joy!

**RICH.**
==79==I cannot weep; for all my body’s moisture
==80==Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart;
==81==Nor can my tongue unload my heart’s great burden,
==82==For self-same wind that I should speak withal
==83==Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
==84==And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
==85==To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
==86==Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me.
==87==Richard, I bear thy name, I’ll venge thy death,
==88==Or die renowned by attempting it.

**EDW.**
==89==His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
==90==His dukedom and his chair with me is left.

**RICH.**
==91==Nay, if thou be that princely eagle’s bird,
==92==Show thy descent by gazing ’gainst the sun;
==93==For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say,
==94==Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.

*March. Enter Warwick, Marquess Montague, and their army.*

**WAR.**
==95==How now, fair lords? What fare? What news abroad?

**RICH.**
==96==Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recompt
==97==Our baleful news, and at each word’s deliverance
==98==Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
==99==The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
==100==O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!

**EDW.**
==101==O Warwick, Warwick, that Plantagenet,
==102==Which held thee dearly as his soul’s redemption,
==103==Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.

**WAR.**
==104==Ten days ago I drown’d these news in tears;
==105==And now, to add more measure to your woes,
==106==I come to tell you things sith then befall’n.
==107==After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
==108==Where your brave father breath’d his latest gasp,
==109==Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
==110==Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
==111==I, then in London, keeper of the King,
==112==Muster’d my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,
==113==And very well appointed, as I thought,
==114==March’d toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen,
==115==Bearing the King in my behalf along;
==116==For by my scouts I was advertised
==117==That she was coming with a full intent
==118==To dash our late decree in parliament
==119==Touching King Henry’s oath and your succession.
==120==Short tale to make, we at Saint Albans met,
==121==Our battles join’d, and both sides fiercely fought;
==122==But whether ’twas the coldness of the King,
==123==Who look’d full gently on his warlike queen,
==124==That robb’d my soldiers of their heated spleen;
==125==Or whether ’twas report of her success,
==126==Or more than common fear of Clifford’s rigor,
==127==Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
==128==I cannot judge: but, to conclude with truth,
==129==Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
==130==Our soldiers’, like the night-owl’s lazy flight,
==131==Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
==132==Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
==133==I cheer’d them up with justice of our cause,
==134==With promise of high pay and great rewards;
==135==But all in vain, they had no heart to fight,
==136==And we, in them, no hope to win the day,
==137==So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;
==138==Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,
==139==In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you;
==140==For in the marches here we heard you were,
==141==Making another head to fight again.

**EDW.**
==142==Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
==143==And when came George from Burgundy to England?

**WAR.**
==144==Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers,
==145==And for your brother, he was lately sent
==146==From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
==147==With aid of soldiers to this needful war.

**RICH.**
==148==’Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
==149==Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
==150==But ne’er till now his scandal of retire.

**WAR.**
==151==Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
==152==For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
==153==Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head,
==154==And wring the aweful scepter from his fist,
==155==Were he as famous and as bold in war
==156==As he is fam’d for mildness, peace, and prayer.

**RICH.**
==157==I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not.
==158==’Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.
==159==But in this troublous time what’s to be done?
==160==Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
==161==And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
==162==Numb’ring our Ave-Maries with our beads?
==163==Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
==164==Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
==165==If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.

**WAR.**
==166==Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,
==167==And therefore comes my brother Montague.
==168==Attend me, lords: the proud insulting Queen,
==169==With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
==170==And of their feather many more proud birds,
==171==Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.
==172==He swore consent to your succession,
==173==His oath enrolled in the parliament;
==174==And now to London all the crew are gone
==175==To frustrate both his oath and what beside
==176==May make against the house of Lancaster.
==177==Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.
==178==Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
==179==With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
==180==Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
==181==Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
==182==Why, *via*! To London will we march,
==183==And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
==184==And once again cry “Charge!” upon our foes,
==185==But never once again turn back and fly.

**RICH.**
==186==Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.
==187==Ne’er may he live to see a sunshine day
==188==That cries “Retire!” if Warwick bid him stay.

**EDW.**
==189==Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,
==190==And when thou fail’st (as God forbid the hour!) 
==191==Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!

**WAR.**
==192==No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;
==193==The next degree is England’s royal throne;
==194==For King of England shalt thou be proclaim’d
==195==In every borough as we pass along,
==196==And he that throws not up his cap for joy
==197==Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
==198==King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
==199==Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
==200==But sound the trumpets, and about our task.

**RICH.**
==201==Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
==202==As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
==203==I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.

**EDW.**
==204==Then strike up drums. God and Saint George for us!

*Enter Norfolk Messenger.*

**WAR.**
==205==How now? What news?

**NOR. MESS.**
==206==The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me
==207==The Queen is coming with a puissant host,
==208==And craves your company for speedy counsel.

**WAR.**
==209==Why then it sorts, brave warriors. Let’s away.

*Exeunt omnes.*
