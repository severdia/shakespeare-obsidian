## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Field of battle between Sandal Castle and Wakefield.*

*Alarums. Enter Rutland and his Tutor.*

**RUT.**
==1==Ah, whither shall I fly to scape their hands?
==2==Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!

*Enter Clifford and Soldiers.*

**CLIF.**
==3==Chaplain, away, thy priesthood saves thy life.
==4==As for the brat of this accursed duke,
==5==Whose father slew my father, he shall die.

**TUT.**
==6==And I, my lord, will bear him company.

**CLIF.**
==7==Soldiers, away with him!

**TUT.**
==8==Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
==9==Lest thou be hated both of God and man.

*Exit dragged off by Soldiers.*

**CLIF.**
==10==How now? Is he dead already? Or is it fear
==11==That makes him close his eyes? I’ll open them.

**RUT.**
==12==So looks the pent-up lion o’er the wretch
==13==That trembles under his devouring paws;
==14==And so he walks, insulting o’er his prey,
==15==And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
==16==Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword
==17==And not with such a cruel threat’ning look.
==18==Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die:
==19==I am too mean a subject for thy wrath,
==20==Be thou reveng’d on men, and let me live.

**CLIF.**
==21==In vain thou speak’st, poor boy; my father’s blood
==22==Hath stopp’d the passage where thy words should enter.

**RUT.**
==23==Then let my father’s blood open it again,
==24==He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.

**CLIF.**
==25==Had I thy brethren here, their lives and thine
==26==Were not revenge sufficient for me;
==27==No, if I digg’d up thy forefathers’ graves
==28==And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
==29==It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart.
==30==The sight of any of the house of York
==31==Is as a fury to torment my soul;
==32==And till I root out their accursed line,
==33==And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
==34==Therefore⁠—

**RUT.**
==35==O, let me pray before I take my death!
==36==To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!

**CLIF.**
==37==Such pity as my rapier’s point affords.

**RUT.**
==38==I never did thee harm; why wilt thou slay me?

**CLIF.**
==39==Thy father hath.

**RUT.**
==39==           But ’twas ere I was born.
==40==Thou hast one son, for his sake pity me,
==41==Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
==42==He be as miserably slain as I.
==43==Ah, let me live in prison all my days,
==44==And when I give occasion of offense,
==45==Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.

**CLIF.**
==46==No cause?
==47==Thy father slew my father; therefore die.

*Stabs him.*

**RUT.**
==48==*Dii faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae!*

*Dies.*

**CLIF.**
==49==Plantagenet, I come, Plantagenet!
==50==And this thy son’s blood cleaving to my blade
==51==Shall rust upon my weapon, till thy blood,
==52==Congeal’d with this, do make me wipe off both.

*Exit.*
