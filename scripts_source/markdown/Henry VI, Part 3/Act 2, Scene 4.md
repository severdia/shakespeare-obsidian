## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Yorkshire. Another part of the battlefield between Towton and Saxton.*

*Excursions. Enter Richard at one door and Clifford at the other.*

**RICH.**
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
And this for Rutland, both bound to revenge,
Wert thou environ’d with a brazen wall.

**CLIF.**
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
This is the hand that stabb’d thy father York,
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland,
And here’s the heart that triumphs in their death,
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
To execute the like upon thyself⁠—
And so have at thee!

*Alarums. They fight.*

*Warwick comes.*

*Clifford flies.*

**RICH.**
Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase,
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.

*Exeunt.*
