## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Yorkshire. Another part of the battlefield between Towton and Saxton.*

*Excursions. Enter Richard at one door and Clifford at the other.*

**RICH.**
==1==Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
==2==Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
==3==And this for Rutland, both bound to revenge,
==4==Wert thou environ’d with a brazen wall.

**CLIF.**
==5==Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
==6==This is the hand that stabb’d thy father York,
==7==And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland,
==8==And here’s the heart that triumphs in their death,
==9==And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
==10==To execute the like upon thyself⁠—
==11==And so have at thee!

*Alarums. They fight.*

*Warwick comes.*

*Clifford flies.*

**RICH.**
==12==Nay, Warwick, single out some other chase,
==13==For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.

*Exeunt.*
