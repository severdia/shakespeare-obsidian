## Epilogue
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]]

**PROS.**
==1==Now my charms are all o’erthrown,
==2==And what strength I have’s mine own,
==3==Which is most faint. Now ’tis true,
==4==I must be here confin’d by you,
==5==Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
==6==Since I have my dukedom got,
==7==And pardon’d the deceiver, dwell
==8==In this bare island by your spell,
==9==But release me from my bands
==10==With the help of your good hands.
==11==Gentle breath of yours my sails
==12==Must fill, or else my project fails,
==13==Which was to please. Now I want
==14==Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
==15==And my ending is despair,
==16==Unless I be reliev’d by prayer,
==17==Which pierces so, that it assaults
==18==Mercy itself, and frees all faults.
==19==As you from crimes would pardon’d be,
==20==Let your indulgence set me free.


*Exit.*
