## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Before Prospero’s cell.*

*Enter Prospero, Ferdinand, and Miranda.*

**PROS.**
If I have too austerely punish’d you,
Your compensation makes amends, for I
Have given you here a third of mine own life,
Or that for which I live; who once again
I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations
Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
Hast strangely stood the test. Here, afore heaven,
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
And make it halt behind her.

**FER.**
                I do believe it
Against an oracle.

**PROS.**
Then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition
Worthily purchas’d, take my daughter. But
If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
All sanctimonious ceremonies may
With full and holy rite be minist’red,
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
Sour-ey’d disdain, and discord shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,
As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.

**FER.**
                  As I hope
For quiet days, fair issue, and long life,
With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,
The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion
Our worser genius can, shall never melt
Mine honor into lust, to take away
The edge of that day’s celebration,
When I shall think or Phoebus’ steeds are founder’d
Or Night kept chain’d below.

**PROS.**
                Fairly spoke.
Sit then and talk with her, she is thine own.
What, Ariel! My industrious servant, Ariel!

*Enter Ariel.*

**ARI.**
What would my potent master? Here I am.

**PROS.**
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Did worthily perform; and I must use you
In such another trick. Go bring the rabble
( o’er whom I give thee pow’r) here to this place.
Incite them to quick motion, for I must
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
Some vanity of mine art. It is my promise,
And they expect it from me.

**ARI.**
                Presently?

**PROS.**
Ay, with a twink.

**ARI.**
*Before you can say “come” and “go,”*
*And breathe twice, and cry “so, so,”*
*Each one, tripping on his toe,*
*Will be here with mop and mow.*
*Do you love me, master? No?*

**PROS.**
Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
Till thou dost hear me call.

**ARI.**
              Well; I conceive.

*Exit.*

**PROS.**
Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
Too much the rein. The strongest oaths are straw
To th’ fire i’ th’ blood. Be more abstenious,
Or else good night your vow!

**FER.**
                I warrant you, sir,
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
Abates the ardor of my liver.

**PROS.**
                Well.
Now come, my Ariel, bring a corollary,
Rather than want a spirit. Appear, and pertly!
No tongue! All eyes! Be silent.

*Soft music.*

*Enter Iris.*

**IRIS.**
Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
Of wheat, rye, barley, fetches, oats, and pease;
Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
And flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep;
Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
Which spungy April at thy hest betrims,
To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,
Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard,
And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
Where thou thyself dost air—the Queen o’ th’ sky,
Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am I,
Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign Grace,
Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
To come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.
*(Juno descends slowly in her car.)*
Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.

*Enter Ceres.*

**CER.**
Hail, many-colored messenger, that ne’er
Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
Who with thy saffron wings upon my flow’rs
Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing show’rs,
And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
My bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down,
Rich scarf to my proud earth—why hath thy Queen
Summon’d me hither, to this short-grass’d green?

**IRIS.**
A contract of true love to celebrate,
And some donation freely to estate
On the bless’d lovers.

**CER.**
           Tell me, heavenly bow,
If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
Do now attend the Queen? Since they did plot
The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
Her and her blind boy’s scandall’d company
I have forsworn.

**IRIS.**
           Of her society
Be not afraid. I met her Deity
Cutting the clouds towards Paphos; and her son
Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
Till Hymen’s torch be lighted; but in vain,
Mars’s hot minion is return’d again;
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,
And be a boy right out.

*Juno alights.*

**CER.**
              Highest Queen of state,
Great Juno, comes, I know her by her gait.

**JUNO.**
How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,
And honor’d in their issue.

*They sing.*

**JUNO.**
*Honor, riches, marriage-blessing,*
*Long continuance, and increasing,*
*Hourly joys be still upon you!*
*Juno sings her blessings on you.*

**CER.**
*Earth’s increase, foison plenty,*
*Barns and garners never empty;*
*Vines with clust’ring bunches growing,*
*Plants with goodly burden bowing;*
*Spring come to you at the farthest*
*In the very end of harvest!*
*Scarcity and want shall shun you,*
*Ceres’ blessing so is on you.*

**FER.**
This is a most majestic vision, and
Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold
To think these spirits?

**PROS.**
           Spirits, which by mine art
I have from their confines call’d to enact
My present fancies.

**FER.**
           Let me live here ever;
So rare a wond’red father and a wise
Makes this place Paradise.

*Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment.*

**PROS.**
              Sweet now, silence!
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
There’s something else to do. Hush and be mute,
Or else our spell is marr’d.

**IRIS.**
You nymphs, call’d Naiades, of the windring brooks,
With your sedg’d crowns and ever-harmless looks,
Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land
Answer your summons; Juno does command.
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
A contract of true love; be not too late.
*(Enter certain Nymphs.)*
You sunburn’d sicklemen, of August weary,
Come hither from the furrow and be merry.
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
In country footing.

*Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance, towards the end whereof Prospero starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish.*

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
I had forgot that foul conspiracy
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
Against my life. The minute of their plot
Is almost come.
*(To the Spirits.)*
        Well done, avoid; no more.

**FER.**
This is strange. Your father’s in some passion
That works him strongly.

**MIR.**
              Never till this day
Saw I him touch’d with anger, so distemper’d.

**PROS.**
You do look, my son, in a mov’d sort,
As if you were dismay’d; be cheerful, sir.
Our revels now are ended. These our actors
(As I foretold you) were all spirits, and
Are melted into air, into thin air,
And like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capp’d tow’rs, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
And like this insubstantial pageant faded
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made on; and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d;
Bear with my weakness, my old brain is troubled.
Be not disturb’d with my infirmity.
If you be pleas’d, retire into my cell,
And there repose. A turn or two I’ll walk
To still my beating mind.

**BOTH FER. AND MIR.**
              We wish your peace.

**PROS.**
*(To Ariel.)*
Come with a thought.
*(To Ferdinand and Miranda.)*
           I thank thee.
*(Exeunt Ferdinand and Miranda.)*
                     Ariel! Come.

*Enter Ariel.*

**ARI.**
Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?

**PROS.**
                         Spirit,
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.

**ARI.**
Ay, my commander. When I presented Ceres,
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear’d
Lest I might anger thee.

**PROS.**
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlots?

**ARI.**
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,
So full of valor that they smote the air
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,
At which like unback’d colts they prick’d their ears,
Advanc’d their eyelids, lifted up their noses
As they smelt music. So I charm’d their ears
That calf-like they my lowing follow’d through
Tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,
Which ent’red their frail shins. At last I left them
I’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
There dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake
O’erstunk their feet.

**PROS.**
           This was well done, my bird.
Thy shape invisible retain thou still.
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
For stale to catch these thieves.

**ARI.**
                  I go, I go.

*Exit.*

**PROS.**
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
And as with age his body uglier grows,
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
Even to roaring.
*(Enter Ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, etc.)*
Come, hang them on this line.

*Prospero and Ariel remain, invisible.*

*Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, all wet.*

**CAL.**
Pray you tread softly, that the blind mole may not
Hear a foot fall; we now are near his cell.

**STE.**
Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than play’d the Jack with us.

**TRIN.**
Monster, I do smell all horse-piss, at which my nose is in great indignation.

**STE.**
So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take a displeasure against you, look you⁠—

**TRIN.**
Thou wert but a lost monster.

**CAL.**
Good my lord, give me thy favor still.
Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to
Shall hoodwink this mischance; therefore speak softly,
All’s hush’d as midnight yet.

**TRIN.**
Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool⁠—

**STE.**
There is not only disgrace and dishonor in that, monster, but an infinite loss.

**TRIN.**
That’s more to me than my wetting; yet this is your harmless fairy, monster!

**STE.**
I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for my labor.

**CAL.**
Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
This is the mouth o’ th’ cell. No noise, and enter.
Do that good mischief which may make this island
Thine own forever, and I, thy Caliban,
For aye thy foot-licker.

**STE.**
Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

**TRIN.**
O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!

**CAL.**
Let it alone, thou fool, it is but trash.

**TRIN.**
O, ho, monster! We know what belongs to a frippery. O King Stephano!

**STE.**
Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand, I’ll have that gown.

**TRIN.**
Thy Grace shall have it.

**CAL.**
The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean
To dote thus on such luggage? Let’t alone
And do the murder first. If he awake,
From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,
Make us strange stuff.

**STE.**
Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line. Now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.

**TRIN.**
Do, do; we steal by line and level, and’t like your Grace.

**STE.**
I thank thee for that jest; here’s a garment for’t. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country. ’Steal by line and level’ is an excellent pass of pate; there’s another garment for’t.

**TRIN.**
Monster, come put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.

**CAL.**
I will have none on’t. We shall lose our time,
And all be turn’d to barnacles, or to apes
With foreheads villainous low.

**STE.**
Monster, lay-to your fingers. Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.

**TRIN.**
And this.

**STE.**
Ay, and this.

*A noise of hunters heard. Enter diverse Spirits in shape of dogs and hounds, hunting them about; Prospero and Ariel setting them on.*

**PROS.**
Hey, Mountain, hey!

**ARI.**
Silver! There it goes, Silver!

**PROS.**
Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! Hark, hark!
*(Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo are driven out.)*
Go, charge my goblins that they grind their joints
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
Than pard or cat o’ mountain.

**ARI.**
                Hark, they roar!

**PROS.**
Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
Lies at my mercy all mine enemies.
Shortly shall all my labors end, and thou
Shalt have the air at freedom. For a little
Follow, and do me service.

*Exeunt.*
