## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Before Prospero’s cell.*

*Enter Prospero, Ferdinand, and Miranda.*

**PROS.**
==1==If I have too austerely punish’d you,
==2==Your compensation makes amends, for I
==3==Have given you here a third of mine own life,
==4==Or that for which I live; who once again
==5==I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations
==6==Were but my trials of thy love, and thou
==7==Hast strangely stood the test. Here, afore heaven,
==8==I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
==9==Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
==10==For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
==11==And make it halt behind her.

**FER.**
==11==                I do believe it
==12==Against an oracle.

**PROS.**
==13==Then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition
==14==Worthily purchas’d, take my daughter. But
==15==If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
==16==All sanctimonious ceremonies may
==17==With full and holy rite be minist’red,
==18==No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
==19==To make this contract grow; but barren hate,
==20==Sour-ey’d disdain, and discord shall bestrew
==21==The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
==22==That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,
==23==As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.

**FER.**
==23==                  As I hope
==24==For quiet days, fair issue, and long life,
==25==With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,
==26==The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion
==27==Our worser genius can, shall never melt
==28==Mine honor into lust, to take away
==29==The edge of that day’s celebration,
==30==When I shall think or Phoebus’ steeds are founder’d
==31==Or Night kept chain’d below.

**PROS.**
==31==                Fairly spoke.
==32==Sit then and talk with her, she is thine own.
==33==What, Ariel! My industrious servant, Ariel!

*Enter Ariel.*

**ARI.**
==34==What would my potent master? Here I am.

**PROS.**
==35==Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
==36==Did worthily perform; and I must use you
==37==In such another trick. Go bring the rabble
==38==( o’er whom I give thee pow’r) here to this place.
==39==Incite them to quick motion, for I must
==40==Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
==41==Some vanity of mine art. It is my promise,
==42==And they expect it from me.

**ARI.**
==42==                Presently?

**PROS.**
==43==Ay, with a twink.

**ARI.**
==44==*Before you can say “come” and “go,”*
==45==*And breathe twice, and cry “so, so,”*
==46==*Each one, tripping on his toe,*
==47==*Will be here with mop and mow.*
==48==*Do you love me, master? No?*

**PROS.**
==49==Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
==50==Till thou dost hear me call.

**ARI.**
==50==              Well; I conceive.

*Exit.*

**PROS.**
==51==Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
==52==Too much the rein. The strongest oaths are straw
==53==To th’ fire i’ th’ blood. Be more abstenious,
==54==Or else good night your vow!

**FER.**
==54==                I warrant you, sir,
==55==The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
==56==Abates the ardor of my liver.

**PROS.**
==56==                Well.
==57==Now come, my Ariel, bring a corollary,
==58==Rather than want a spirit. Appear, and pertly!
==59==No tongue! All eyes! Be silent.

*Soft music.*

*Enter Iris.*

**IRIS.**
==60==Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
==61==Of wheat, rye, barley, fetches, oats, and pease;
==62==Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
==63==And flat meads thatch’d with stover, them to keep;
==64==Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
==65==Which spungy April at thy hest betrims,
==66==To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom-groves,
==67==Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
==68==Being lass-lorn; thy pole-clipt vineyard,
==69==And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
==70==Where thou thyself dost air—the Queen o’ th’ sky,
==71==Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am I,
==72==Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign Grace,
==73==Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
==74==To come and sport. Her peacocks fly amain.
*(Juno descends slowly in her car.)*
==75==Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.

*Enter Ceres.*

**CER.**
==76==Hail, many-colored messenger, that ne’er
==77==Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
==78==Who with thy saffron wings upon my flow’rs
==79==Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing show’rs,
==80==And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
==81==My bosky acres and my unshrubb’d down,
==82==Rich scarf to my proud earth—why hath thy Queen
==83==Summon’d me hither, to this short-grass’d green?

**IRIS.**
==84==A contract of true love to celebrate,
==85==And some donation freely to estate
==86==On the bless’d lovers.

**CER.**
==86==           Tell me, heavenly bow,
==87==If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
==88==Do now attend the Queen? Since they did plot
==89==The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
==90==Her and her blind boy’s scandall’d company
==91==I have forsworn.

**IRIS.**
==91==           Of her society
==92==Be not afraid. I met her Deity
==93==Cutting the clouds towards Paphos; and her son
==94==Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
==95==Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
==96==Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
==97==Till Hymen’s torch be lighted; but in vain,
==98==Mars’s hot minion is return’d again;
==99==Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
==100==Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,
==101==And be a boy right out.

*Juno alights.*

**CER.**
==101==              Highest Queen of state,
==102==Great Juno, comes, I know her by her gait.

**JUNO.**
==103==How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
==104==To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be,
==105==And honor’d in their issue.

*They sing.*

**JUNO.**
==106==*Honor, riches, marriage-blessing,*
==107==*Long continuance, and increasing,*
==108==*Hourly joys be still upon you!*
==109==*Juno sings her blessings on you.*

**CER.**
==110==*Earth’s increase, foison plenty,*
==111==*Barns and garners never empty;*
==112==*Vines with clust’ring bunches growing,*
==113==*Plants with goodly burden bowing;*
==114==*Spring come to you at the farthest*
==115==*In the very end of harvest!*
==116==*Scarcity and want shall shun you,*
==117==*Ceres’ blessing so is on you.*

**FER.**
==118==This is a most majestic vision, and
==119==Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold
==120==To think these spirits?

**PROS.**
==120==           Spirits, which by mine art
==121==I have from their confines call’d to enact
==122==My present fancies.

**FER.**
==122==           Let me live here ever;
==123==So rare a wond’red father and a wise
==124==Makes this place Paradise.

*Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment.*

**PROS.**
==124==              Sweet now, silence!
==125==Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
==126==There’s something else to do. Hush and be mute,
==127==Or else our spell is marr’d.

**IRIS.**
==128==You nymphs, call’d Naiades, of the windring brooks,
==129==With your sedg’d crowns and ever-harmless looks,
==130==Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land
==131==Answer your summons; Juno does command.
==132==Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
==133==A contract of true love; be not too late.
*(Enter certain Nymphs.)*
==134==You sunburn’d sicklemen, of August weary,
==135==Come hither from the furrow and be merry.
==136==Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on,
==137==And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
==138==In country footing.

*Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance, towards the end whereof Prospero starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish.*

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
==139==I had forgot that foul conspiracy
==140==Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
==141==Against my life. The minute of their plot
==142==Is almost come.
*(To the Spirits.)*
==142==        Well done, avoid; no more.

**FER.**
==143==This is strange. Your father’s in some passion
==144==That works him strongly.

**MIR.**
==144==              Never till this day
==145==Saw I him touch’d with anger, so distemper’d.

**PROS.**
==146==You do look, my son, in a mov’d sort,
==147==As if you were dismay’d; be cheerful, sir.
==148==Our revels now are ended. These our actors
==149==(As I foretold you) were all spirits, and
==150==Are melted into air, into thin air,
==151==And like the baseless fabric of this vision,
==152==The cloud-capp’d tow’rs, the gorgeous palaces,
==153==The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
==154==Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,
==155==And like this insubstantial pageant faded
==156==Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
==157==As dreams are made on; and our little life
==158==Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex’d;
==159==Bear with my weakness, my old brain is troubled.
==160==Be not disturb’d with my infirmity.
==161==If you be pleas’d, retire into my cell,
==162==And there repose. A turn or two I’ll walk
==163==To still my beating mind.

**BOTH FER. AND MIR.**
==163==              We wish your peace.

**PROS.**
*(To Ariel.)*
==164==Come with a thought.
*(To Ferdinand and Miranda.)*
==164==           I thank thee.
*(Exeunt Ferdinand and Miranda.)*
==164==                     Ariel! Come.

*Enter Ariel.*

**ARI.**
==165==Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?

**PROS.**
==165==                         Spirit,
==166==We must prepare to meet with Caliban.

**ARI.**
==167==Ay, my commander. When I presented Ceres,
==168==I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear’d
==169==Lest I might anger thee.

**PROS.**
==170==Say again, where didst thou leave these varlots?

**ARI.**
==171==I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,
==172==So full of valor that they smote the air
==173==For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
==174==For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
==175==Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,
==176==At which like unback’d colts they prick’d their ears,
==177==Advanc’d their eyelids, lifted up their noses
==178==As they smelt music. So I charm’d their ears
==179==That calf-like they my lowing follow’d through
==180==Tooth’d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,
==181==Which ent’red their frail shins. At last I left them
==182==I’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
==183==There dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake
==184==O’erstunk their feet.

**PROS.**
==184==           This was well done, my bird.
==185==Thy shape invisible retain thou still.
==186==The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
==187==For stale to catch these thieves.

**ARI.**
==187==                  I go, I go.

*Exit.*

**PROS.**
==188==A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
==189==Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
==190==Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
==191==And as with age his body uglier grows,
==192==So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
==193==Even to roaring.
*(Enter Ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, etc.)*
==194==Come, hang them on this line.

*Prospero and Ariel remain, invisible.*

*Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, all wet.*

**CAL.**
==195==Pray you tread softly, that the blind mole may not
==196==Hear a foot fall; we now are near his cell.

**STE.**
==197==Monster, your fairy, which you say is a harmless fairy, has done little better than play’d the Jack with us.

**TRIN.**
==198==Monster, I do smell all horse-piss, at which my nose is in great indignation.

**STE.**
==199==So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take a displeasure against you, look you⁠—

**TRIN.**
==200==Thou wert but a lost monster.

**CAL.**
==201==Good my lord, give me thy favor still.
==202==Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to
==203==Shall hoodwink this mischance; therefore speak softly,
==204==All’s hush’d as midnight yet.

**TRIN.**
==205==Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool⁠—

**STE.**
==206==There is not only disgrace and dishonor in that, monster, but an infinite loss.

**TRIN.**
==207==That’s more to me than my wetting; yet this is your harmless fairy, monster!

**STE.**
==208==I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er ears for my labor.

**CAL.**
==209==Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
==210==This is the mouth o’ th’ cell. No noise, and enter.
==211==Do that good mischief which may make this island
==212==Thine own forever, and I, thy Caliban,
==213==For aye thy foot-licker.

**STE.**
==214==Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

**TRIN.**
==215==O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!

**CAL.**
==216==Let it alone, thou fool, it is but trash.

**TRIN.**
==217==O, ho, monster! We know what belongs to a frippery. O King Stephano!

**STE.**
==218==Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand, I’ll have that gown.

**TRIN.**
==219==Thy Grace shall have it.

**CAL.**
==220==The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean
==221==To dote thus on such luggage? Let’t alone
==222==And do the murder first. If he awake,
==223==From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,
==224==Make us strange stuff.

**STE.**
==225==Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line, is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under the line. Now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.

**TRIN.**
==226==Do, do; we steal by line and level, and’t like your Grace.

**STE.**
==227==I thank thee for that jest; here’s a garment for’t. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country. ’Steal by line and level’ is an excellent pass of pate; there’s another garment for’t.

**TRIN.**
==228==Monster, come put some lime upon your fingers, and away with the rest.

**CAL.**
==229==I will have none on’t. We shall lose our time,
==230==And all be turn’d to barnacles, or to apes
==231==With foreheads villainous low.

**STE.**
==232==Monster, lay-to your fingers. Help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.

**TRIN.**
==233==And this.

**STE.**
==234==Ay, and this.

*A noise of hunters heard. Enter diverse Spirits in shape of dogs and hounds, hunting them about; Prospero and Ariel setting them on.*

**PROS.**
==235==Hey, Mountain, hey!

**ARI.**
==236==Silver! There it goes, Silver!

**PROS.**
==237==Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! Hark, hark!
*(Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo are driven out.)*
==238==Go, charge my goblins that they grind their joints
==239==With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
==240==With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
==241==Than pard or cat o’ mountain.

**ARI.**
==241==                Hark, they roar!

**PROS.**
==242==Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
==243==Lies at my mercy all mine enemies.
==244==Shortly shall all my labors end, and thou
==245==Shalt have the air at freedom. For a little
==246==Follow, and do me service.

*Exeunt.*
