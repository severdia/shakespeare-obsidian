## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Before Prospero’s cell.*

*Enter Ferdinand bearing a log.*

**FER.**
==1==There be some sports are painful, and their labor
==2==Delight in them sets off; some kinds of baseness
==3==Are nobly undergone; and most poor matters
==4==Point to rich ends. This my mean task
==5==Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
==6==The mistress which I serve quickens what’s dead,
==7==And makes my labors pleasures. O, she is
==8==Ten times more gentle than her father’s crabbed;
==9==And he’s compos’d of harshness. I must remove
==10==Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up,
==11==Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress
==12==Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness
==13==Had never like executor. I forget;
==14==But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labors,
==15==Most busil’est when I do it.

*Enter Miranda, and Prospero at a distance, unseen.*

**MIR.**
==15==              Alas, now pray you
==16==Work not so hard. I would the lightning had
==17==Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin’d to pile!
==18==Pray set it down, and rest you. When this burns,
==19==’Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
==20==Is hard at study; pray now rest yourself,
==21==He’s safe for these three hours.

**FER.**
==21==                O most dear mistress,
==22==The sun will set before I shall discharge
==23==What I must strive to do.

**MIR.**
==23==              If you’ll sit down,
==24==I’ll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that,
==25==I’ll carry it to the pile.

**FER.**
==25==           No, precious creature,
==26==I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
==27==Than you should such dishonor undergo,
==28==While I sit lazy by.

**MIR.**
==28==           It would become me
==29==As well as it does you; and I should do it
==30==With much more ease, for my good will is to it,
==31==And yours it is against.

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
==31==              Poor worm, thou art infected!
==32==This visitation shows it.

**MIR.**
==32==              You look wearily.

**FER.**
==33==No, noble mistress, ’tis fresh morning with me
==34==When you are by at night. I do beseech you⁠—
==35==Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers⁠—
==36==What is your name?

**MIR.**
==36==           Miranda.—O my father,
==37==I have broke your hest to say so.

**FER.**
==37==                  Admir’d Miranda,
==38==Indeed the top of admiration! Worth
==39==What’s dearest to the world! Full many a lady
==40==I have ey’d with best regard, and many a time
==41==Th’ harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
==42==Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues
==43==Have I lik’d several women, never any
==44==With so full soul but some defect in her
==45==Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow’d,
==46==And put it to the foil. But you, O you,
==47==So perfect and so peerless, are created
==48==Of every creature’s best!

**MIR.**
==48==              I do not know
==49==One of my sex; no woman’s face remember,
==50==Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
==51==More that I may call men than you, good friend,
==52==And my dear father. How features are abroad
==53==I am skilless of; but by my modesty
==54==(The jewel in my dower), I would not wish
==55==Any companion in the world but you;
==56==Nor can imagination form a shape,
==57==Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
==58==Something too wildly, and my father’s precepts
==59==I therein do forget.

**FER.**
==59==           I am, in my condition,
==60==A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king
==61==(I would, not so!), and would no more endure
==62==This wooden slavery than to suffer
==63==The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
==64==The very instant that I saw you, did
==65==My heart fly to your service, there resides,
==66==To make me slave to it, and for your sake
==67==Am I this patient log-man.

**MIR.**
==67==              Do you love me?

**FER.**
==68==O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,
==69==And crown what I profess with kind event
==70==If I speak true! If hollowly, invert
==71==What best is boded me to mischief! I,
==72==Beyond all limit of what else i’ th’ world,
==73==Do love, prize, honor you.

**MIR.**
==73==              I am a fool
==74==To weep at what I am glad of.

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
==74==                Fair encounter
==75==Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
==76==On that which breeds between ’em!

**FER.**
==76==                  Wherefore weep you?

**MIR.**
==77==At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer
==78==What I desire to give; and much less take
==79==What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,
==80==And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
==81==The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,
==82==And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
==83==I am your wife, if you will marry me;
==84==If not, I’ll die your maid. To be your fellow
==85==You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant,
==86==Whether you will or no.

**FER.**
==86==              My mistress, dearest,
==87==And I thus humble ever.

**MIR.**
==87==              My husband then?

**FER.**
==88==Ay, with a heart as willing
==89==As bondage e’er of freedom. Here’s my hand.

**MIR.**
==90==And mine, with my heart in’t. And now farewell
==91==Till half an hour hence.

**FER.**
==91==              A thousand, thousand!

*Exeunt Ferdinand and Miranda severally.*

**PROS.**
==92==So glad of this as they I cannot be,
==93==Who are surpris’d withal; but my rejoicing
==94==At nothing can be more. I’ll to my book,
==95==For yet ere supper-time must I perform
==96==Much business appertaining.

*Exit.*
