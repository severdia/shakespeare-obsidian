## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Another part of the island.*

*Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco, and others.*

**GON.**
==1==Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause
==2==(So have we all) of joy; for our escape
==3==Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
==4==Is common: every day some sailor’s wife,
==5==The masters of some merchant, and the merchant
==6==Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle
==7==(I mean our preservation), few in millions
==8==Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh
==9==Our sorrow with our comfort.

**ALON.**
==9==                Prithee peace.

**SEB.**
==10==He receives comfort like cold porridge.

**ANT.**
==11==The visitor will not give him o’er so.

**SEB.**
==12==Look, he’s winding up the watch of his wit, by and by it will strike.

**GON.**
==13==Sir⁠—

**SEB.**
==14==One. Tell.

**GON.**
==15==When every grief is entertain’d that’s offer’d,
==16==Comes to th’ entertainer⁠—

**SEB.**
==17==A dollar.

**GON.**
==18==Dolor comes to him indeed, you have spoken truer than you purpos’d.

**SEB.**
==19==You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

**GON.**
==20==Therefore, my lord⁠—

**ANT.**
==21==Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

**ALON.**
==22==I prithee spare.

**GON.**
==23==Well, I have done. But yet⁠—

**SEB.**
==24==He will be talking.

**ANT.**
==25==Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first begins to crow?

**SEB.**
==26==The old cock.

**ANT.**
==27==The cock’rel.

**SEB.**
==28==Done. The wager?

**ANT.**
==29==A laughter.

**SEB.**
==30==A match!

**ADR.**
==31==Though this island seem to be desert⁠—

**SEB.**
==32==Ha, ha, ha!

**ANT.**
==33==So: you’re paid!

**ADR.**
==34==Uninhabitable, and almost inaccessible⁠—

**SEB.**
==35==Yet⁠—

**ADR.**
==36==Yet⁠—

**ANT.**
==37==He could not miss’t.

**ADR.**
==38==It must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.

**ANT.**
==39==Temperance was a delicate wench.

**SEB.**
==40==Ay, and a subtle, as he most learnedly deliver’d.

**ADR.**
==41==The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

**SEB.**
==42==As if it had lungs, and rotten ones.

**ANT.**
==43==Or, as ’twere perfum’d by a fen.

**GON.**
==44==Here is every thing advantageous to life.

**ANT.**
==45==True, save means to live.

**SEB.**
==46==Of that there’s none, or little.

**GON.**
==47==How lush and lusty the grass looks! How green!

**ANT.**
==48==The ground indeed is tawny.

**SEB.**
==49==With an eye of green in’t.

**ANT.**
==50==He misses not much.

**SEB.**
==51==No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

**GON.**
==52==But the rarity of it is—which is indeed almost beyond credit⁠—

**SEB.**
==53==As many vouch’d rarieties are.

**GON.**
==54==That our garments, being (as they were) drench’d in the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses, being rather new dy’d than stain’d with salt water.

**ANT.**
==55==If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not say he lies?

**SEB.**
==56==Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report.

**GON.**
==57==Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of the King’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.

**SEB.**
==58==’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.

**ADR.**
==59==Tunis was never grac’d before with such a paragon to their queen.

**GON.**
==60==Not since widow Dido’s time.

**ANT.**
==61==Widow? A pox o’ that! How came that widow in? Widow Dido!

**SEB.**
==62==What if he had said “widower Aeneas” too? Good Lord, how you take it!

**ADR.**
==63==“Widow Dido,” said you? You make me study of that. She was of Carthage, not of Tunis.

**GON.**
==64==This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

**ADR.**
==65==Carthage?

**GON.**
==66==I assure you, Carthage.

**ANT.**
==67==His word is more than the miraculous harp.

**SEB.**
==68==He hath rais’d the wall, and houses too.

**ANT.**
==69==What impossible matter will he make easy next?

**SEB.**
==70==I think he will carry this island home in his pocket, and give it his son for an apple.

**ANT.**
==71==And sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands.

**GON.**
==72==Ay.

**ANT.**
==73==Why, in good time.

**GON.**
==74==Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen.

**ANT.**
==75==And the rarest that e’er came there.

**SEB.**
==76==Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

**ANT.**
==77==O, widow Dido? Ay, widow Dido.

**GON.**
==78==Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it? I mean, in a sort.

**ANT.**
==79==That ‘sort’ was well fish’d for.

**GON.**
==80==When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?

**ALON.**
==81==You cram these words into mine ears against
==82==The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
==83==Married my daughter there! For coming thence,
==84==My son is lost and (in my rate) she too,
==85==Who is so far from Italy removed
==86==I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
==87==Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
==88==Hath made his meal on thee?

**FRAN.**
==88==                Sir, he may live.
==89==I saw him beat the surges under him,
==90==And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,
==91==Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
==92==The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head
==93==’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared
==94==Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
==95==To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,
==96==As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt
==97==He came alive to land.

**ALON.**
==97==              No, no, he’s gone.

**SEB.**
==98==Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
==99==That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
==100==But rather loose her to an African,
==101==Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,
==102==Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t.

**ALON.**
==102==                     Prithee peace.

**SEB.**
==103==You were kneel’d to, and importun’d otherwise
==104==By all of us, and the fair soul herself
==105==Weigh’d between loathness and obedience, at
==106==Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,
==107==I fear forever. Milan and Naples have
==108==More widows in them of this business’ making
==109==Than we bring men to comfort them.
==110==The fault’s your own.

**ALON.**
==110==           So is the dear’st o’ th’ loss.

**GON.**
==111==My Lord Sebastian,
==112==The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,
==113==And time to speak it in. You rub the sore,
==114==When you should bring the plaster.

**SEB.**
==114==                  Very well.

**ANT.**
==115==And most chirurgeonly.

**GON.**
==116==It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
==117==When you are cloudy.

**SEB.**
==117==           Fowl weather?

**ANT.**
==117==                     Very foul.

**GON.**
==118==Had I plantation of this isle, my lord⁠—

**ANT.**
==119==He’d sow’t with nettle-seed.

**SEB.**
==119==                Or docks, or mallows.

**GON.**
==120==And were the king on’t, what would I do?

**SEB.**
==121==Scape being drunk, for want of wine.

**GON.**
==122==I’ th’ commonwealth I would, by contraries,
==123==Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
==124==Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
==125==Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
==126==And use of service, none; contract, succession,
==127==Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
==128==No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
==129==No occupation, all men idle, all;
==130==And women too, but innocent and pure;
==131==No sovereignty⁠—

**SEB.**
==131==        Yet he would be king on’t.

**ANT.**
==132==The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.

**GON.**
==133==All things in common nature should produce
==134==Without sweat or endeavor: treason, felony,
==135==Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
==136==Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
==137==Of it own kind, all foison, all abundance,
==138==To feed my innocent people.

**SEB.**
==139==No marrying ’mong his subjects?

**ANT.**
==140==None, man, all idle—whores and knaves.

**GON.**
==141==I would with such perfection govern, sir,
==142==T’ excel the golden age.

**SEB.**
==142==              ’Save his Majesty!

**ANT.**
==143==Long live Gonzalo!

**GON.**
==143==           And—do you mark me, sir?

**ALON.**
==144==Prithee no more; thou dost talk nothing to me.

**GON.**
==145==I do well believe your Highness, and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.

**ANT.**
==146==’Twas you we laugh’d at.

**GON.**
==147==Who, in this kind of merry fooling, am nothing to you; so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.

**ANT.**
==148==What a blow was there given!

**SEB.**
==149==And it had not fall’n flat-long.

**GON.**
==150==You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.

*Enter Ariel invisible, playing solemn music.*

**SEB.**
==151==We would so, and then go a-batfowling.

**ANT.**
==152==Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

**GON.**
==153==No, I warrant you, I will not adventure my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?

**ANT.**
==154==Go sleep, and hear us.

*All sleep except Alonso, Sebastian, and Antonio.*

**ALON.**
==155==What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
==156==Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts. I find
==157==They are inclin’d to do so.

**SEB.**
==157==              Please you, sir,
==158==Do not omit the heavy offer of it.
==159==It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
==160==It is a comforter.

**ANT.**
==160==           We two, my lord,
==161==Will guard your person while you take your rest,
==162==And watch your safety.

**ALON.**
==162==           Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

*Alonso sleeps.*

*Exit Ariel.*

**SEB.**
==163==What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

**ANT.**
==164==It is the quality o’ th’ climate.

**SEB.**
==164==                  Why
==165==Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
==166==Myself dispos’d to sleep.

**ANT.**
==166==              Nor I, my spirits are nimble.
==167==They fell together all, as by consent;
==168==They dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
==169==Worthy Sebastian, O, what might—? No more⁠—
==170==And yet methinks I see it in thy face,
==171==What thou shouldst be. Th’ occasion speaks thee, and
==172==My strong imagination sees a crown
==173==Dropping upon thy head.

**SEB.**
==173==              What? Art thou waking?

**ANT.**
==174==Do you not hear me speak?

**SEB.**
==174==              I do, and surely
==175==It is a sleepy language, and thou speak’st
==176==Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
==177==This is a strange repose, to be asleep
==178==With eyes wide open—standing, speaking, moving⁠—
==179==And yet so fast asleep.

**ANT.**
==179==              Noble Sebastian,
==180==Thou let’st thy fortune sleep—die, rather; wink’st
==181==Whiles thou art waking.

**SEB.**
==181==              Thou dost snore distinctly,
==182==There’s meaning in thy snores.

**ANT.**
==183==I am more serious than my custom; you
==184==Must be so too, if heed me; which to do,
==185==Trebles thee o’er.

**SEB.**
==185==           Well; I am standing water.

**ANT.**
==186==I’ll teach you how to flow.

**SEB.**
==186==              Do so. To ebb
==187==Hereditary sloth instructs me.

**ANT.**
==187==                  O!
==188==If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
==189==Whiles thus you mock it! How, in stripping it,
==190==You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
==191==Most often, do so near the bottom run
==192==By their own fear or sloth.

**SEB.**
==192==              Prithee say on.
==193==The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
==194==A matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,
==195==Which throes thee much to yield.

**ANT.**
==195==                  Thus, sir:
==196==Although this lord of weak remembrance, this
==197==Who shall be of as little memory
==198==When he is earth’d, hath here almost persuaded
==199==(For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only
==200==Professes to persuade) the King his son’s alive,
==201==’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d,
==202==As he that sleeps here swims.

**SEB.**
==202==                I have no hope
==203==That he’s undrown’d.

**ANT.**
==203==           O, out of that no hope
==204==What great hope have you! No hope, that way, is
==205==Another way so high a hope that even
==206==Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
==207==But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
==208==That Ferdinand is drown’d?

**SEB.**
==208==              He’s gone.

**ANT.**
==208==                     Then tell me,
==209==Who’s the next heir of Naples?

**SEB.**
==209==                  Claribel.

**ANT.**
==210==She that is Queen of Tunis; she that dwells
==211==Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples
==212==Can have no note, unless the sun were post⁠—
==213==The Man i’ th’ Moon’s too slow—till new-born chins
==214==Be rough and razorable; she that from whom
==215==We all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again
==216==(And by that destiny) to perform an act
==217==Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come
==218==In yours and my discharge.

**SEB.**
==218==              What stuff is this? How say you?
==219==’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis,
==220==So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions
==221==There is some space.

**ANT.**
==221==           A space whose ev’ry cubit
==222==Seems to cry out, “How shall that Claribel
==223==Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
==224==And let Sebastian wake.” Say this were death
==225==That now hath seiz’d them, why, they were no worse
==226==Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
==227==As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
==228==As amply and unnecessarily
==229==As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
==230==A chough of as deep chat. O that you bore
==231==The mind that I do! What a sleep were this
==232==For your advancement! Do you understand me?

**SEB.**
==233==Methinks I do.

**ANT.**
==233==        And how does your content
==234==Tender your own good fortune?

**SEB.**
==234==                  I remember
==235==You did supplant your brother Prospero.

**ANT.**
==235==                       True.
==236==And look how well my garments sit upon me,
==237==Much feater than before. My brother’s servants
==238==Were then my fellows, now they are my men.

**SEB.**
==239==But, for your conscience?

**ANT.**
==240==Ay, sir; where lies that? If ’twere a kibe,
==241==’Twould put me to my slipper; but I feel not
==242==This deity in my bosom. Twenty consciences,
==243==That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they,
==244==And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
==245==No better than the earth he lies upon,
==246==If he were that which now he’s like—that’s dead,
==247==Whom I with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
==248==Can lay to bed forever; whiles you, doing thus,
==249==To the perpetual wink for aye might put
==250==This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
==251==Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
==252==They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
==253==They’ll tell the clock to any business that
==254==We say befits the hour.

**SEB.**
==254==              Thy case, dear friend,
==255==Shall be my president: as thou got’st Milan,
==256==I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword. One stroke
==257==Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest,
==258==And I the King shall love thee.

**ANT.**
==258==                  Draw together;
==259==And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
==260==To fall it on Gonzalo.

**SEB.**
==260==           O, but one word.

*They talk apart.*

*Enter Ariel, invisible, with music and song.*

**ARI.**
==261==My master through his art foresees the danger
==262==That you, his friend, are in, and sends me forth
==263==(For else his project dies) to keep them living.
*(Sings in Gonzalo’s ear.)*
==264== *While you here do snoring lie,*
==265== *Open-ey’d conspiracy*
==266== *His time doth take.*
==267== *If of life you keep a care,*
==268== *Shake off slumber, and beware.*
==269== *Awake, awake!*

**ANT.**
==270==Then let us both be sudden.

**GON.**
*(Waking.)*
==270==              Now, good angels
==271==Preserve the King!

*Wakes Alonso.*

**ALON.**
==272==Why, how now, ho! Awake? Why are you drawn?
==273==Wherefore this ghastly looking?

**GON.**
==273==                What’s the matter?

**SEB.**
==274==Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
==275==Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
==276==Like bulls, or rather lions. Did’t not wake you?
==277==It struck mine ear most terribly.

**ALON.**
==277==                  I heard nothing.

**ANT.**
==278==O, ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear,
==279==To make an earthquake; sure it was the roar
==280==Of a whole herd of lions.

**ALON.**
==280==              Heard you this, Gonzalo?

**GON.**
==281==Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming
==282==(And that a strange one too) which did awake me.
==283==I shak’d you, sir, and cried. As mine eyes open’d,
==284==I saw their weapons drawn. There was a noise,
==285==That’s verily. ’Tis best we stand upon our guard,
==286==Or that we quit this place. Let’s draw our weapons.

**ALON.**
==287==Lead off this ground, and let’s make further search
==288==For my poor son.

**GON.**
==288==        Heavens keep him from these beasts!
==289==For he is sure i’ th’ island.

**ALON.**
==289==              Lead away.

**ARI.**
==290==Prospero my lord shall know what I have done.
==291==So, King, go safely on to seek thy son.

*Exeunt.*
