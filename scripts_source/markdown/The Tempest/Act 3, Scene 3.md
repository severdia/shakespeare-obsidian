## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the island.*

*Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco, etc.*

**GON.**
==1==By’r lakin, I can go no further, sir,
==2==My old bones aches. Here’s a maze trod indeed
==3==Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
==4==I needs must rest me.

**ALON.**
==4==           Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
==5==Who am myself attach’d with weariness
==6==To th’ dulling of my spirits. Sit down, and rest.
==7==Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it
==8==No longer for my flatterer. He is drown’d
==9==Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
==10==Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

**ANT.**
*(Aside to Sebastian)*
==11==I am right glad that he’s so out of hope.
==12==Do not for one repulse forgo the purpose
==13==That you resolv’d t’ effect.

**SEB.**
*(Aside to Antonio)*
==13==              The next advantage
==14==Will we take throughly.

**ANT.**
*(Aside to Sebastian)*
==14==              Let it be tonight,
==15==For now they are oppress’d with travail, they
==16==Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
==17==As when they are fresh.

**SEB.**
*(Aside to Antonio)*
==17==              I say tonight. No more.

*Solemn and strange music.*

*Prospero on the top, invisible.*

**ALON.**
==18==What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!

**GON.**
==19==Marvelous sweet music!

*Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; and dance about it with gentle actions of salutations; and inviting the King, etc., to eat, they depart.*

**ALON.**
==20==Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

**SEB.**
==21==A living drollery. Now I will believe
==22==That there are unicorns; that in Arabia
==23==There is one tree, the phoenix’ throne, one phoenix
==24==At this hour reigning there.

**ANT.**
==24==              I’ll believe both;
==25==And what does else want credit, come to me,
==26==And I’ll be sworn ’tis true. Travelers ne’er did lie,
==27==Though fools at home condemn ’em.

**GON.**
==27==                     If in Naples
==28==I should report this now, would they believe me?
==29==If I should say I saw such islanders
==30==(For, certes, these are people of the island),
==31==Who though they are of monstrous shape, yet note
==32==Their manners are more gentle, kind, than of
==33==Our human generation you shall find
==34==Many, nay, almost any.

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
==34==              Honest lord,
==35==Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
==36==Are worse than devils.

**ALON.**
==36==              I cannot too much muse
==37==Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound expressing
==38==(Although they want the use of tongue) a kind
==39==Of excellent dumb discourse.

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
==39==                Praise in departing.

**FRAN.**
==40==They vanish’d strangely.

**SEB.**
==40==              No matter, since
==41==They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
==42==Will’t please you taste of what is here?

**ALON.**
==42==                     Not I.

**GON.**
==43==Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
==44==Who would believe that there were mountaineers,
==45==Dew-lapp’d, like bulls, whose throats had hanging at ’em
==46==Wallets of flesh? Or that there were such men
==47==Whose heads stood in their breasts? Which now we find
==48==Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
==49==Good warrant of.

**ALON.**
==49==           I will stand to, and feed,
==50==Although my last, no matter, since I feel
==51==The best is past. Brother, my lord the Duke,
==52==Stand to, and do as we.

*Thunder and lightning.*

*Enter Ariel, like a harpy, claps his wings upon the table, and with a quaint device the banquet vanishes.*

**ARI.**
==53==You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
==54==That hath to instrument this lower world
==55==And what is in’t, the never-surfeited sea
==56==Hath caus’d to belch up you; and on this island
==57==Where man doth not inhabit—you ’mongst men
==58==Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
==59==And even with such-like valor men hang and drown
==60==Their proper selves.
*(Alonso, Sebastian, etc. draw their swords.)*
==60==           You fools! I and my fellows
==61==Are ministers of Fate. The elements,
==62==Of whom your swords are temper’d, may as well
==63==Wound the loud winds, or with bemock’d-at stabs
==64==Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
==65==One dowle that’s in my plume. My fellow ministers
==66==Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
==67==Your swords are now too massy for your strengths,
==68==And will not be uplifted. But remember
==69==(For that’s my business to you) that you three
==70==From Milan did supplant good Prospero,
==71==Expos’d unto the sea (which hath requit it) 
==72==Him, and his innocent child; for which foul deed
==73==The pow’rs, delaying (not forgetting), have
==74==Incens’d the seas and shores—yea, all the creatures,
==75==Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
==76==They have bereft; and do pronounce by me
==77==Ling’ring perdition (worse than any death
==78==Can be at once) shall step by step attend
==79==You and your ways, whose wraths to guard you from⁠—
==80==Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
==81==Upon your heads—is nothing but heart’s sorrow,
==82==And a clear life ensuing.

*He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table.*

**PROS.**
==83==Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
==84==Perform’d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring.
==85==Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
==86==In what thou hadst to say; so with good life,
==87==And observation strange, my meaner ministers
==88==Their several kinds have done. My high charms work,
==89==And these, mine enemies, are all knit up
==90==In their distractions. They now are in my pow’r;
==91==And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
==92==Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown’d,
==93==And his and mine lov’d darling.

*Exit above.*

**GON.**
==94==I’ th’ name of something holy, sir, why stand you
==95==In this strange stare?

**ALON.**
==95==           O, it is monstrous! Monstrous!
==96==Methought the billows spoke, and told me of it;
==97==The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
==98==That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounc’d
==99==The name of Prosper; it did base my trespass.
==100==Therefore my son i’ th’ ooze is bedded; and
==101==I’ll seek him deeper than e’er plummet sounded,
==102==And with him there lie mudded.

*Exit.*

**SEB.**
==102==                  But one fiend at a time,
==103==I’ll fight their legions o’er.

**ANT.**
==103==              I’ll be thy second.

*Exeunt Sebastian and Antonio.*

**GON.**
==104==All three of them are desperate: their great guilt
==105==(Like poison given to work a great time after) 
==106==Now gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
==107==(That are of suppler joints) follow them swiftly,
==108==And hinder them from what this ecstasy
==109==May now provoke them to.

**ADR.**
==109==              Follow, I pray you.

*Exeunt omnes.*
