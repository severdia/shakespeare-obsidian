## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Another part of the island.*

*Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.*

**STE.**
==1== Tell not me. When the butt is out, we will drink water—not a drop before; therefore bear up and board ’em. Servant-monster, drink to me.

**TRIN.**
==2== Servant-monster? The folly of this island! They say there’s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if th’ other two be brain’d like us, the state totters.

**STE.**
==3== Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee. Thy eyes are almost set in thy head.

**TRIN.**
==4== Where should they be set else? He were a brave monster indeed if they were set in his tail.

**STE.**
==5== My man-monster hath drown’d his tongue in sack. For my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard.

**TRIN.**
==6== Your lieutenant if you list, he’s no standard.

**STE.**
==7== We’ll not run, *Monsieur* Monster.

**TRIN.**
==8== Nor go neither; but you’ll lie like dogs, and yet say nothing neither.

**STE.**
==9== Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a good moon-calf.

**CAL.**
==10== How does thy honor? Let me lick thy shoe. I’ll not serve him, he is not valiant.

**TRIN.**
==11== Thou liest, most ignorant monster, I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debosh’d fish thou, was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I today? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?

**CAL.**
==12== Lo, how he mocks me! Wilt thou let him, my lord?

**TRIN.**
==13== “Lord,” quoth he? That a monster should be such a natural!

**CAL.**
==14== Lo, lo again. Bite him to death, I prithee.

**STE.**
==15== Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head. If you prove a mutineer—the next tree! The poor monster’s my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.

**CAL.**
==16== I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleas’d to hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?

**STE.**
==17== Marry, will I; kneel, and repeat it. I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.

*Enter Ariel, invisible.*

**CAL.**
==18== As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant,
==19== A sorcerer, that by his cunning hath
==20== Cheated me of the island.

**ARI.**
==21== Thou liest.

**CAL.**
==21==         Thou liest, thou jesting monkey thou!
==22== I would my valiant master would destroy thee.
==23== I do not lie.

**STE.**
==24== Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in ’s tale, by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.

**TRIN.**
==25== Why, I said nothing.

**STE.**
==26== Mum then, and no more.—Proceed.

**CAL.**
==27== I say by sorcery he got this isle;
==28== From me he got it. If thy greatness will
==29== Revenge it on him—for I know thou dar’st,
==30== But this thing dare not⁠—

**STE.**
==31== That’s most certain.

**CAL.**
==32== Thou shalt be lord of it, and I’ll serve thee.

**STE.**
==33== How now shall this be compass’d? Canst thou bring me to the party?

**CAL.**
==34== Yea, yea, my lord. I’ll yield him thee asleep,
==35== Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.

**ARI.**
==36== Thou liest, thou canst not.

**CAL.**
==37== What a pied ninny’s this! Thou scurvy patch!
==38== I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows,
==39== And take his bottle from him. When that’s gone,
==40== He shall drink nought but brine, for I’ll not show him
==41== Where the quick freshes are.

**STE.**
==42== Trinculo, run into no further danger; interrupt the monster one word further, and by this hand, I’ll turn my mercy out o’ doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.

**TRIN.**
==43== Why, what did I? I did nothing. I’ll go farther off.

**STE.**
==44== Didst thou not say he lied?

**ARI.**
==45== Thou liest.

**STE.**
==46== Do I so? Take thou that.
*(Beats Trinculo.)*
==47== As you like this, give me the lie another time.

**TRIN.**
==48== I did not give the lie. Out o’ your wits, and hearing too? A pox o’ your bottle! This can sack and drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!

**CAL.**
==49== Ha, ha, ha!

**STE.**
==50== Now forward with your tale.—Prithee stand further off.

**CAL.**
==51== Beat him enough. After a little time
==52== I’ll beat him too.

**STE.**
==52==            Stand farther.—Come, proceed.

**CAL.**
==53== Why, as I told thee, ’tis a custom with him
==54== I’ th’ afternoon to sleep. There thou mayst brain him,
==55== Having first seiz’d his books; or with a log
==56== Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
==57== Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
==58== First to possess his books; for without them
==59== He’s but a sot, as I am; nor hath not
==60== One spirit to command: they all do hate him
==61== As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
==62== He has brave utensils (for so he calls them) 
==63== Which when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.
==64== And that most deeply to consider is
==65== The beauty of his daughter. He himself
==66== Calls her a nonpareil. I never saw a woman
==67== But only Sycorax my dam and she;
==68== But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
==69== As great’st does least.

**STE.**
==69==            Is it so brave a lass?

**CAL.**
==70== Ay, lord, she will become thy bed, I warrant,
==71== And bring thee forth brave brood.

**STE.**
==72== Monster, I will kill this man. His daughter and I will be king and queen—’save our Graces! And Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?

**TRIN.**
==73== Excellent.

**STE.**
==74== Give me thy hand. I am sorry I beat thee; but while thou liv’st keep a good tongue in thy head.

**CAL.**
==75== Within this half hour will he be asleep.
==76== Wilt thou destroy him then?

**STE.**
==76==                 Ay, on mine honor.

**ARI.**
==77== This will I tell my master.

**CAL.**
==78== Thou mak’st me merry; I am full of pleasure,
==79== Let us be jocund. Will you troll the catch
==80== You taught me but while-ere?

**STE.**
==81== At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
*(Sings.)*
==82== *“Flout ’em and scout ’em,*
==83== *And scout ’em and flout ’em!*
==84== *Thought is free.”*

**CAL.**
==85== That’s not the tune.

*Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe.*

**STE.**
==86== What is this same?

**TRIN.**
==87== This is the tune of our catch, play’d by the picture of Nobody.

**STE.**
==88== If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness. If thou beest a devil, take’t as thou list.

**TRIN.**
==89== O, forgive me my sins!

**STE.**
==90== He that dies pays all debts. I defy thee. Mercy upon us!

**CAL.**
==91== Art thou afeard?

**STE.**
==92== No, monster, not I.

**CAL.**
==93== Be not afeard, the isle is full of noises,
==94== Sounds, and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
==95== Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
==96== Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices,
==97== That if I then had wak’d after long sleep,
==98== Will make me sleep again, and then in dreaming,
==99== The clouds methought would open, and show riches
==100== Ready to drop upon me, that when I wak’d
==101== I cried to dream again.

**STE.**
==102== This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall have my music for nothing.

**CAL.**
==103== When Prospero is destroy’d.

**STE.**
==104== That shall be by and by. I remember the story.

**TRIN.**
==105== The sound is going away. Let’s follow it, and after do our work.

**STE.**
==106== Lead, monster, we’ll follow. I would I could see this taborer; he lays it on.

**TRIN.**
==107== Wilt come? I’ll follow Stephano.

*Exeunt.*
