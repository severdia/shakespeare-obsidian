## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[ị Epilogue|Epilogue →]]

*Before Prospero’s cell.*

*Enter Prospero in his magic robes, and Ariel.*

**PROS.**
==1== Now does my project gather to a head:
==2== My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and Time
==3== Goes upright with his carriage. How’s the day?

**ARI.**
==4== On the sixth hour, at which time, my lord,
==5== You said our work should cease.

**PROS.**
==5==                   I did say so,
==6== When first I rais’d the tempest. Say, my spirit,
==7== How fares the King and ’s followers?

**ARI.**
==7==                      Confin’d together
==8== In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
==9== Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
==10== In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
==11== They cannot budge till your release. The King,
==12== His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,
==13== And the remainder mourning over them,
==14== Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
==15== Him that you term’d, sir, “the good old Lord Gonzalo,”
==16== His tears runs down his beard like winter’s drops
==17== From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works ’em
==18== That if you now beheld them, your affections
==19== Would become tender.

**PROS.**
==19==               Dost thou think so, spirit?

**ARI.**
==20== Mine would, sir, were I human.

**PROS.**
==20==                   And mine shall.
==21== Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
==22== Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
==23== One of their kind, that relish all as sharply
==24== Passion as they, be kindlier mov’d than thou art?
==25== Though with their high wrongs I am struck to th’ quick,
==26== Yet, with my nobler reason, ’gainst my fury
==27== Do I take part. The rarer action is
==28== In virtue than in vengeance. They being penitent,
==29== The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
==30== Not a frown further. Go, release them, Ariel.
==31== My charms I’ll break, their senses I’ll restore,
==32== And they shall be themselves.

**ARI.**
==32==                 I’ll fetch them, sir.

*Exit.*

*Prospero traces a magic circle with his staff.*

**PROS.**
==33== Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves,
==34== And ye that on the sands with printless foot
==35== Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him
==36== When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
==37== By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
==38== Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime
==39== Is to make midnight mushrumps, that rejoice
==40== To hear the solemn curfew: by whose aid
==41== (Weak masters though ye be) I have bedimm’d
==42== The noontide sun, call’d forth the mutinous winds,
==43== And ’twixt the green sea and the azur’d vault
==44== Set roaring war; to the dread rattling thunder
==45== Have I given fire, and rifted Jove’s stout oak
==46== With his own bolt; the strong-bas’d promontory
==47== Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck’d up
==48== The pine and cedar. Graves at my command
==49== Have wak’d their sleepers, op’d, and let ’em forth
==50== By my so potent art. But this rough magic
==51== I here abjure; and when I have requir’d
==52== Some heavenly music (which even now I do) 
==53== To work mine end upon their senses that
==54== This airy charm is for, I’ll break my staff,
==55== Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
==56== And deeper than did ever plummet sound
==57== I’ll drown my book.
*(Solemn music.)*
*(Here enters Ariel before; then Alonso, with a frantic gesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and Antonio in like manner, attended by Adrian and Francisco.)*
*(They all enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there stand charm’d; which Prospero observing, speaks.)*
==58== A solemn air, and the best comforter
==59== To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,
==60== Now useless, boil’d within thy skull! There stand,
==61== For you are spell-stopp’d.
==62== Holy Gonzalo, honorable man,
==63== Mine eyes, ev’n sociable to the show of thine,
==64== Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
==65== And as the morning steals upon the night,
==66== Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
==67== Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
==68== Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
==69== My true preserver, and a loyal sir
==70== To him thou follow’st! I will pay thy graces
==71== Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
==72== Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter;
==73== Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
==74== Thou art pinch’d for’t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
==75== You, brother mine, that entertain’d ambition,
==76== Expell’d remorse and nature, whom, with Sebastian
==77== (Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong),
==78== Would here have kill’d your king, I do forgive thee,
==79== Unnatural though thou art.—Their understanding
==80== Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
==81== Will shortly fill the reasonable shores
==82== That now lie foul and muddy. Not one of them
==83== That yet looks on me, or would know me! Ariel,
==84== Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell.
*(Exit Ariel, and returns immediately.)*
==85== I will discase me, and myself present
==86== As I was sometime Milan. Quickly, spirit,
==87== Thou shalt ere long be free.

*Ariel sings and helps to attire him.*

**ARI.**
==88== *Where the bee sucks, there suck I,*
==89== *In a cowslip’s bell I lie;*
==90== *There I couch when owls do cry.*
==91== *On the bat’s back I do fly*
==92== *After summer merrily.*
==93== *Merrily, merrily shall I live now,*
==94== *Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.*

**PROS.**
==95== Why, that’s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee,
==96== But yet thou shalt have freedom. So, so, so.
==97== To the King’s ship, invisible as thou art;
==98== There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
==99== Under the hatches. The master and the boatswain
==100== Being awake, enforce them to this place;
==101== And presently, I prithee.

**ARI.**
==102== I drink the air before me, and return
==103== Or ere your pulse twice beat.

*Exit.*

**GON.**
==104== All torment, trouble, wonder, and amazement
==105== Inhabits here. Some heavenly power guide us
==106== Out of this fearful country!

**PROS.**
==106==                 Behold, sir King,
==107== The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero.
==108== For more assurance that a living prince
==109== Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body,
==110== And to thee and thy company I bid
==111== A hearty welcome.

**ALON.**
==111==            Whe’er thou beest he or no,
==112== Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me
==113== (As late I have been), I not know. Thy pulse
==114== Beats as of flesh and blood; and since I saw thee,
==115== Th’ affliction of my mind amends, with which
==116== I fear a madness held me. This must crave
==117== (And if this be at all) a most strange story.
==118== Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat
==119== Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
==120== Be living, and be here?

**PROS.**
*(To Gonzalo.)*
==120==               First, noble friend,
==121== Let me embrace thine age, whose honor cannot
==122== Be measur’d or confin’d.

**GON.**
==122==               Whether this be,
==123== Or be not, I’ll not swear.

**PROS.**
==123==               You do yet taste
==124== Some subtleties o’ th’ isle, that will not let you
==125== Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
*(Aside to Sebastian and Antonio.)*
==126== But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
==127== I here could pluck his Highness’ frown upon you
==128== And justify you traitors. At this time
==129== I will tell no tales.

**SEB.**
*(Aside.)*
==129==         The devil speaks in him.

**PROS.**
==129==                          No.
==130== For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
==131== Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
==132== Thy rankest fault—all of them; and require
==133== My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know
==134== Thou must restore.

**ALON.**
==134==            If thou beest Prospero,
==135== Give us particulars of thy preservation,
==136== How thou hast met us here, whom three hours since
==137== Were wrack’d upon this shore; where I have lost
==138== (How sharp the point of this remembrance is!) 
==139== My dear son Ferdinand.

**PROS.**
==139==               I am woe for’t, sir.

**ALON.**
==140== Irreparable is the loss, and patience
==141== Says, it is past her cure.

**PROS.**
==141==               I rather think
==142== You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
==143== For the like loss I have her sovereign aid,
==144== And rest myself content.

**ALON.**
==144==               You the like loss?

**PROS.**
==145== As great to me as late, and supportable
==146== To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
==147== Than you may call to comfort you; for I
==148== Have lost my daughter.

**ALON.**
==148==               A daughter?
==149== O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
==150== The King and Queen there! That they were, I wish
==151== Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
==152== Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?

**PROS.**
==153== In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
==154== At this encounter do so much admire
==155== That they devour their reason, and scarce think
==156== Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
==157== Are natural breath; but howsoev’r you have
==158== Been justled from your senses, know for certain
==159== That I am Prospero, and that very duke
==160== Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
==161== Upon this shore (where you were wrack’d) was landed,
==162== To be the lord on’t. No more yet of this,
==163== For ’tis a chronicle of day by day,
==164== Not a relation for a breakfast, nor
==165== Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
==166== This cell’s my court. Here have I few attendants,
==167== And subjects none abroad. Pray you look in.
==168== My dukedom since you have given me again,
==169== I will requite you with as good a thing,
==170== At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
==171== As much as me my dukedom.

*Here Prospero discovers Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess.*

**MIR.**
==172== Sweet lord, you play me false.

**FER.**
==172==                 No, my dearest love,
==173== I would not for the world.

**MIR.**
==174== Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
==175== And I would call it fair play.

**ALON.**
==175==                 If this prove
==176== A vision of the island, one dear son
==177== Shall I twice lose.

**SEB.**
==177==            A most high miracle!

**FER.**
==178== Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
==179== I have curs’d them without cause.

*Kneels.*

**ALON.**
==179==                   Now all the blessings
==180== Of a glad father compass thee about!
==181== Arise, and say how thou cam’st here.

**MIR.**
==181==                      O wonder!
==182== How many goodly creatures are there here!
==183== How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world
==184== That has such people in’t!

**PROS.**
==184==               ’Tis new to thee.

**ALON.**
==185== What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
==186== Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours.
==187== Is she the goddess that hath sever’d us,
==188== And brought us thus together?

**FER.**
==188==                 Sir, she is mortal;
==189== But by immortal Providence she’s mine.
==190== I chose her when I could not ask my father
==191== For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
==192== Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
==193== Of whom so often I have heard renown,
==194== But never saw before; of whom I have
==195== Receiv’d a second life; and second father
==196== This lady makes him to me.

**ALON.**
==196==                 I am hers.
==197== But O, how oddly will it sound that I
==198== Must ask my child forgiveness!

**PROS.**
==198==                   There, sir, stop.
==199== Let us not burden our remembrances with
==200== A heaviness that’s gone.

**GON.**
==200==               I have inly wept,
==201== Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,
==202== And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
==203== For it is you that have chalk’d forth the way
==204== Which brought us hither.

**ALON.**
==204==               I say amen, Gonzalo!

**GON.**
==205== Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
==206== Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
==207== Beyond a common joy, and set it down
==208== With gold on lasting pillars: in one voyage
==209== Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
==210== And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
==211== Where he himself was lost; Prospero, his dukedom
==212== In a poor isle; and all of us, ourselves,
==213== When no man was his own.

**ALON.**
*(To Ferdinand and Miranda.)*
==213==               Give me your hands.
==214== Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
==215== That doth not wish you joy!

**GON.**
==215==                 Be it so, amen!
*(Enter Ariel, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following.)*
==216== O, look, sir, look, sir, here is more of us.
==217== I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
==218== This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
==219== That swear’st grace o’erboard, not an oath on shore?
==220== Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?

**BOATS.**
==221== The best news is, that we have safely found
==222== Our king and company; the next, our ship⁠—
==223== Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split⁠—
==224== Is tight and yare, and bravely rigg’d as when
==225== We first put out to sea.

**ARI.**
*(Aside to Prospero)*
==225==               Sir, all this service
==226== Have I done since I went.

**PROS.**
*(Aside to Ariel)*
==226==               My tricksy spirit!

**ALON.**
==227== These are not natural events, they strengthen
==228== From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?

**BOATS.**
==229== If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
==230== I’ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
==231== And (how we know not) all clapp’d under hatches,
==232== Where, but even now, with strange and several noises
==233== Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
==234== And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
==235== We were awak’d; straightway, at liberty;
==236== Where we, in all our trim, freshly beheld
==237== Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master
==238== Cap’ring to eye her. On a trice, so please you,
==239== Even in a dream, were we divided from them,
==240== And were brought moping hither.

**ARI.**
*(Aside to Prospero)*
==240==                   Was’t well done?

**PROS.**
*(Aside to Ariel)*
==241== Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.

**ALON.**
==242== This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod,
==243== And there is in this business more than nature
==244== Was ever conduct of. Some oracle
==245== Must rectify our knowledge.

**PROS.**
==245==                 Sir, my liege,
==246== Do not infest your mind with beating on
==247== The strangeness of this business. At pick’d leisure,
==248== Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you
==249== (Which to you shall seem probable) of every
==250== These happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful
==251== And think of each thing well.
*(Aside to Ariel.)*
==251==                 Come hither, spirit.
==252== Set Caliban and his companions free;
==253== Untie the spell.
*(Exit Ariel.)*
==253==         How fares my gracious sir?
==254== There are yet missing of your company
==255== Some few odd lads that you remember not.

*Enter Ariel, driving in Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo in their stol’n apparel.*

**STE.**
==256== Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. *Coraggio*, bully-monster, *coraggio*!

**TRIN.**
==257== If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here’s a goodly sight.

**CAL.**
==258== O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
==259== How fine my master is! I am afraid
==260== He will chastise me.

**SEB.**
==260==            Ha, ha!
==261== What things are these, my Lord Antonio?
==262== Will money buy ’em?

**ANT.**
==262==            Very like; one of them
==263== Is a plain fish, and no doubt marketable.

**PROS.**
==264== Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
==265== Then say if they be true. This misshapen knave⁠—
==266== His mother was a witch, and one so strong
==267== That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
==268== And deal in her command without her power.
==269== These three have robb’d me, and this demi-devil
==270== (For he’s a bastard one) had plotted with them
==271== To take my life. Two of these fellows you
==272== Must know and own, this thing of darkness I
==273== Acknowledge mine.

**CAL.**
==273==            I shall be pinch’d to death.

**ALON.**
==274== Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

**SEB.**
==275== He is drunk now. Where had he wine?

**ALON.**
==276== And Trinculo is reeling ripe. Where should they
==277== Find this grand liquor that hath gilded ’em?
==278== How cam’st thou in this pickle?

**TRIN.**
==279== I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that I fear me will never out of my bones. I shall not fear fly-blowing.

**SEB.**
==280== Why, how now, Stephano?

**STE.**
==281== O, touch me not, I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

**PROS.**
==282== You’ld be king o’ the isle, sirrah?

**STE.**
==283== I should have been a sore one then.

**ALON.**
==284== This is a strange thing as e’er I look’d on.

*Pointing to Caliban.*

**PROS.**
==285== He is as disproportion’d in his manners
==286== As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
==287== Take with you your companions. As you look
==288== To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

**CAL.**
==289== Ay, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter,
==290== And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
==291== Was I to take this drunkard for a god,
==292== And worship this dull fool!

**PROS.**
==292==               Go to, away!

**ALON.**
==293== Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

**SEB.**
==294== Or stole it, rather.

*Exeunt Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo.*

**PROS.**
==295== Sir, I invite your Highness and your train
==296== To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
==297== For this one night; which, part of it, I’ll waste
==298== With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
==299== Go quick away—the story of my life,
==300== And the particular accidents gone by
==301== Since I came to this isle. And in the morn
==302== I’ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples,
==303== Where I have hope to see the nuptial
==304== Of these our dear-belov’d solemnized,
==305== And thence retire me to my Milan, where
==306== Every third thought shall be my grave.

**ALON.**
==306==                      I long
==307== To hear the story of your life, which must
==308== Take the ear strangely.

**PROS.**
==308==               I’ll deliver all,
==309== And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales,
==310== And sail so expeditious, that shall catch
==311== Your royal fleet far off.
*(Aside to Ariel.)*
==311==               My Ariel, chick,
==312== That is thy charge. Then to the elements
==313== Be free, and fare thou well!—Please you draw near.

*Exeunt omnes.*
