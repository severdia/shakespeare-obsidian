## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*The island. Before Prospero’s cell.*

*Enter Prospero and Miranda.*

**MIR.**
==1== If by your art, my dearest father, you have
==2== Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
==3== The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch,
==4== But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,
==5== Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffered
==6== With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel
==7== (Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her) 
==8== Dash’d all to pieces! O, the cry did knock
==9== Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d.
==10== Had I been any God of power, I would
==11== Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
==12== It should the good ship so have swallow’d, and
==13== The fraughting souls within her.

**PROS.**
==13==                   Be collected,
==14== No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart
==15== There’s no harm done.

**MIR.**
==15==            O woe the day!

**PROS.**
==15==                      No harm:
==16== I have done nothing, but in care of thee
==17== (Of thee my dear one, thee my daughter), who
==18== Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
==19== Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
==20== Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
==21== And thy no greater father.

**MIR.**
==21==               More to know
==22== Did never meddle with my thoughts.

**PROS.**
==22==                   ’Tis time
==23== I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
==24== And pluck my magic garment from me. So,
*(Lays down his mantle.)*
==25== Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes, have comfort.
==26== The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch’d
==27== The very virtue of compassion in thee,
==28== I have with such provision in mine art
==29== So safely ordered that there is no soul⁠—
==30== No, not so much perdition as an hair
==31== Betid to any creature in the vessel
==32== Which thou heardst cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down,
==33== For thou must now know farther.

**MIR.**
==33==                   You have often
==34== Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp’d
==35== And left me to a bootless inquisition,
==36== Concluding, “Stay: not yet.”

**PROS.**
==36==                 The hour’s now come,
==37== The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.
==38== Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember
==39== A time before we came unto this cell?
==40== I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
==41== Out three years old.

**MIR.**
==41==            Certainly, sir, I can.

**PROS.**
==42== By what? By any other house, or person?
==43== Of any thing the image, tell me, that
==44== Hath kept with thy remembrance.

**MIR.**
==44==                   ’Tis far off;
==45== And rather like a dream than an assurance
==46== That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
==47== Four, or five, women once that tended me?

**PROS.**
==48== Thou hadst; and more, Miranda. But how is it
==49== That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
==50== In the dark backward and abysm of time?
==51== If thou rememb’rest aught ere thou cam’st here,
==52== How thou cam’st here thou mayst.

**MIR.**
==52==                   But that I do not.

**PROS.**
==53== Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
==54== Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
==55== A prince of power.

**MIR.**
==55==            Sir, are not you my father?

**PROS.**
==56== Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
==57== She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
==58== Was Duke of Milan, and his only heir
==59== And princess no worse issued.

**MIR.**
==59==                 O the heavens,
==60== What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
==61== Or blessed was’t we did?

**PROS.**
==61==               Both, both, my girl.
==62== By foul play (as thou say’st) were we heav’d thence,
==63== But blessedly help hither.

**MIR.**
==63==               O, my heart bleeds
==64== To think o’ th’ teen that I have turn’d you to,
==65== Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.

**PROS.**
==66== My brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio⁠—
==67== I pray thee mark me—that a brother should
==68== Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself
==69== Of all the world I lov’d, and to him put
==70== The manage of my state, as at that time
==71== Through all the signories it was the first,
==72== And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
==73== In dignity, and for the liberal arts
==74== Without a parallel; those being all my study,
==75== The government I cast upon my brother,
==76== And to my state grew stranger, being transported
==77== And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle⁠—
==78== Dost thou attend me?

**MIR.**
==78==            Sir, most heedfully.

**PROS.**
==79== Being once perfected how to grant suits,
==80== How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who
==81== To trash for overtopping, new created
==82== The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang’d ’em,
==83== Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key
==84== Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ th’ state
==85== To what tune pleas’d his ear, that now he was
==86== The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
==87== And suck’d my verdure out on’t. Thou attend’st not!

**MIR.**
==88== O, good sir, I do.

**PROS.**
==88==            I pray thee mark me.
==89== I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
==90== To closeness and the bettering of my mind
==91== With that which, but by being so retir’d,
==92== O’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brother
==93== Awak’d an evil nature, and my trust,
==94== Like a good parent, did beget of him
==95== A falsehood in its contrary, as great
==96== As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,
==97== A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
==98== Not only with what my revenue yielded,
==99== But what my power might else exact—like one
==100== Who having into truth, by telling of it,
==101== Made such a sinner of his memory
==102== To credit his own lie—he did believe
==103== He was indeed the Duke, out o’ th’ substitution,
==104== And executing th’ outward face of royalty
==105== With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing⁠—
==106== Dost thou hear?

**MIR.**
==106==         Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

**PROS.**
==107== To have no screen between this part he play’d
==108== And him he play’d it for, he needs will be
==109== Absolute Milan—me (poor man) my library
==110== Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
==111== He thinks me now incapable; confederates
==112== (So dry he was for sway) wi’ th’ King of Naples
==113== To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
==114== Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend
==115== The dukedom yet unbow’d (alas, poor Milan!) 
==116== To most ignoble stooping.

**MIR.**
==116==               O the heavens!

**PROS.**
==117== Mark his condition, and th’ event, then tell me
==118== If this might be a brother.

**MIR.**
==118==               I should sin
==119== To think but nobly of my grandmother.
==120== Good wombs have borne bad sons.

**PROS.**
==120==                   Now the condition.
==121== This King of Naples, being an enemy
==122== To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit,
==123== Which was, that he in lieu o’ th’ premises,
==124== Of homage, and I know not how much tribute,
==125== Should presently extirpate me and mine
==126== Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan
==127== With all the honors on my brother; whereon,
==128== A treacherous army levied, one midnight
==129== Fated to th’ purpose, did Antonio open
==130== The gates of Milan, and i’ th’ dead of darkness
==131== The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence
==132== Me and thy crying self.

**MIR.**
==132==               Alack, for pity!
==133== I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,
==134== Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint
==135== That wrings mine eyes to’t.

**PROS.**
==135==               Hear a little further,
==136== And then I’ll bring thee to the present business
==137== Which now’s upon ’s; without the which this story
==138== Were most impertinent.

**MIR.**
==138==               Wherefore did they not
==139== That hour destroy us?

**PROS.**
==139==            Well demanded, wench;
==140== My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
==141== So dear the love my people bore me; nor set
==142== A mark so bloody on the business; but
==143== With colors fairer painted their foul ends.
==144== In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
==145== Bore us some leagues to sea, where they prepared
==146== A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg’d,
==147== Nor tackle, sail, nor mast, the very rats
==148== Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,
==149== To cry to th’ sea, that roar’d to us; to sigh
==150== To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again,
==151== Did us but loving wrong.

**MIR.**
==151==               Alack, what trouble
==152== Was I then to you!

**PROS.**
==152==            O, a cherubin
==153== Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,
==154== Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
==155== When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,
==156== Under my burden groan’d, which rais’d in me
==157== An undergoing stomach, to bear up
==158== Against what should ensue.

**MIR.**
==158==               How came we ashore?

**PROS.**
==159== By Providence divine.
==160== Some food we had, and some fresh water, that
==161== A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
==162== Out of his charity, who being then appointed
==163== Master of this design, did give us, with
==164== Rich garments, linens, stuffs, and necessaries,
==165== Which since have steaded much; so of his gentleness,
==166== Knowing I lov’d my books, he furnish’d me
==167== From mine own library with volumes that
==168== I prize above my dukedom.

**MIR.**
==168==               Would I might
==169== But ever see that man!

**PROS.**
==169==               Now I arise.
*(Puts on his robe.)*
==170== Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow:
==171== Here in this island we arriv’d, and here
==172== Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
==173== Than other princess’ can, that have more time
==174== For vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.

**MIR.**
==175== Heavens thank you for’t! And now I pray you, sir,
==176== For still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason
==177== For raising this sea-storm?

**PROS.**
==177==               Know thus far forth:
==178== By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune
==179== (Now my dear lady) hath mine enemies
==180== Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
==181== I find my zenith doth depend upon
==182== A most auspicious star, whose influence
==183== If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes
==184== Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions.
==185== Thou art inclin’d to sleep; ’tis a good dullness,
==186== And give it way. I know thou canst not choose.
*(Miranda sleeps.)*
==187== Come away, servant, come; I am ready now,
==188== Approach, my Ariel. Come.

*Enter Ariel.*

**ARI.**
==189== All hail, great master, grave sir, hail! I come
==190== To answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,
==191== To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
==192== On the curl’d clouds. To thy strong bidding, task
==193== Ariel, and all his quality.

**PROS.**
==193==               Hast thou, spirit,
==194== Perform’d to point the tempest that I bade thee?

**ARI.**
==195== To every article.
==196== I boarded the King’s ship; now on the beak,
==197== Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
==198== I flam’d amazement. Sometime I’ld divide,
==199== And burn in many places; on the topmast,
==200== The yards and boresprit, would I flame distinctly,
==201== Then meet and join. Jove’s lightning, the precursors
==202== O’ th’ dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
==203== And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
==204== Of sulfurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
==205== Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,
==206== Yea, his dread trident shake.

**PROS.**
==206==                 My brave spirit!
==207== Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
==208== Would not infect his reason?

**ARI.**
==208==                 Not a soul
==209== But felt a fever of the mad, and play’d
==210== Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
==211== Plung’d in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel;
==212== Then all afire with me, the King’s son, Ferdinand,
==213== With hair up-staring (then like reeds, not hair),
==214== Was the first man that leapt; cried, “Hell is empty,
==215== And all the devils are here.”

**PROS.**
==215==               Why, that’s my spirit!
==216== But was not this nigh shore?

**ARI.**
==216==               Close by, my master.

**PROS.**
==217== But are they, Ariel, safe?

**ARI.**
==217==               Not a hair perish’d;
==218== On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
==219== But fresher than before; and as thou badst me,
==220== In troops I have dispers’d them ’bout the isle.
==221== The King’s son have I landed by himself,
==222== Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs,
==223== In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,
==224== His arms in this sad knot.

**PROS.**
==224==               Of the King’s ship,
==225== The mariners, say how thou hast dispos’d,
==226== And all the rest o’ th’ fleet.

**ARI.**
==226==               Safely in harbor
==227== Is the King’s ship, in the deep nook, where once
==228== Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
==229== From the still-vex’d Bermoothes, there she’s hid;
==230== The mariners all under hatches stowed,
==231== Who, with a charm join’d to their suff’red labor,
==232== I have left asleep; and for the rest o’ th’ fleet
==233== (Which I dispers’d), they all have met again,
==234== And are upon the Mediterranean float
==235== Bound sadly home for Naples,
==236== Supposing that they saw the King’s ship wrack’d,
==237== And his great person perish.

**PROS.**
==237==                 Ariel, thy charge
==238== Exactly is perform’d; but there’s more work.
==239== What is the time o’ th’ day?

**ARI.**
==239==               Past the mid season.

**PROS.**
==240== At least two glasses. The time ’twixt six and now
==241== Must by us both be spent most preciously.

**ARI.**
==242== Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
==243== Let me remember thee what thou hast promis’d,
==244== Which is not yet perform’d me.

**PROS.**
==244==                 How now? Moody?
==245== What is’t thou canst demand?

**ARI.**
==245==                 My liberty.

**PROS.**
==246== Before the time be out? No more!

**ARI.**
==246==                   I prithee,
==247== Remember I have done thee worthy service,
==248== Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, serv’d
==249== Without or grudge or grumblings. Thou did promise
==250== To bate me a full year.

**PROS.**
==250==               Dost thou forget
==251== From what a torment I did free thee?

**ARI.**
==251==                      No.

**PROS.**
==252== Thou dost; and think’st it much to tread the ooze
==253== Of the salt deep,
==254== To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
==255== To do me business in the veins o’ th’ earth
==256== When it is bak’d with frost.

**ARI.**
==256==               I do not, sir.

**PROS.**
==257== Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
==258== The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
==259== Was grown into a hoop? Hast thou forgot her?

**ARI.**
==260== No, sir.

**PROS.**
==260==     Thou hast. Where was she born? Speak. Tell me.

**ARI.**
==261== Sir, in Argier.

**PROS.**
==261==         O, was she so? I must
==262== Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
==263== Which thou forget’st. This damn’d witch Sycorax,
==264== For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible
==265== To enter human hearing, from Argier
==266== Thou know’st was banish’d; for one thing she did
==267== They would not take her life. Is not this true?

**ARI.**
==268== Ay, sir.

**PROS.**
==269== This blue-ey’d hag was hither brought with child,
==270== And here was left by th’ sailors. Thou, my slave,
==271== As thou report’st thyself, was then her servant,
==272== And for thou wast a spirit too delicate
==273== To act her earthy and abhorr’d commands,
==274== Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
==275== By help of her more potent ministers,
==276== And in her most unmitigable rage,
==277== Into a cloven pine, within which rift
==278== Imprison’d, thou didst painfully remain
==279== A dozen years; within which space she died,
==280== And left thee there, where thou didst vent thy groans
==281== As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island
==282== (Save for the son that she did litter here,
==283== A freckled whelp, hag-born) not honor’d with
==284== A human shape.

**ARI.**
==284==         Yes—Caliban her son.

**PROS.**
==285== Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
==286== Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know’st
==287== What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
==288== Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts
==289== Of ever-angry bears. It was a torment
==290== To lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax
==291== Could not again undo. It was mine art,
==292== When I arriv’d and heard thee, that made gape
==293== The pine, and let thee out.

**ARI.**
==293==               I thank thee, master.

**PROS.**
==294== If thou more murmur’st, I will rend an oak
==295== And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
==296== Thou hast howl’d away twelve winters.

**ARI.**
==296==                   Pardon, master,
==297== I will be correspondent to command
==298== And do my spriting gently.

**PROS.**
==298==               Do so; and after two days
==299== I will discharge thee.

**ARI.**
==299==            That’s my noble master!
==300== What shall I do? Say what? What shall I do?

**PROS.**
==301== Go make thyself like a nymph o’ th’ sea; be subject
==302== To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
==303== To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
==304== And hither come in’t. Go. Hence with diligence!
*(Exit Ariel.)*
==305== Awake, dear heart, awake! Thou hast slept well,
==306== Awake!

**MIR.**
==307== The strangeness of your story put
==308== Heaviness in me.

**PROS.**
==308==            Shake it off. Come on,
==309== We’ll visit Caliban my slave, who never
==310== Yields us kind answer.

**MIR.**
==310==               ’Tis a villain, sir,
==311== I do not love to look on.

**PROS.**
==311==               But as ’tis,
==312== We cannot miss him. He does make our fire,
==313== Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices
==314== That profit us. What ho! Slave! Caliban!
==315== Thou earth, thou! Speak.

**CAL.**
*(Within.)*
==315==               There’s wood enough within.

**PROS.**
==316== Come forth, I say, there’s other business for thee.
==317== Come, thou tortoise, when?
*(Enter Ariel like a water-nymph.)*
==318== Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
==319== Hark in thine ear.

**ARI.**
==319==            My lord, it shall be done.

*Exit.*

**PROS.**
==320== Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
==321== Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

*Enter Caliban.*

**CAL.**
==322== As wicked dew as e’er my mother brush’d
==323== With raven’s feather from unwholesome fen
==324== Drop on you both! A south-west blow on ye,
==325== And blister you all o’er!

**PROS.**
==326== For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps,
==327== Side-stitches, that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
==328== Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
==329== All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch’d
==330== As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
==331== Than bees that made ’em.

**CAL.**
==331==               I must eat my dinner.
==332== This island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,
==333== Which thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first,
==334== Thou strok’st me and made much of me, wouldst give me
==335== Water with berries in’t, and teach me how
==336== To name the bigger light, and how the less,
==337== That burn by day and night; and then I lov’d thee
==338== And show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,
==339== The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile.
==340== Curs’d be I that did so! All the charms
==341== Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
==342== For I am all the subjects that you have,
==343== Which first was mine own king; and here you sty me
==344== In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
==345== The rest o’ th’ island.

**PROS.**
==345==            Thou most lying slave,
==346== Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have us’d thee
==347== (Filth as thou art) with human care, and lodg’d thee
==348== In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
==349== The honor of my child.

**CAL.**
==350== O ho, O ho, would’t had been done!
==351== Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
==352== This isle with Calibans.

**MIR.**
==352==               Abhorred slave,
==353== Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
==354== Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
==355== Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
==356== One thing or other. When thou didst not, savage,
==357== Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
==358== A thing most brutish, I endow’d thy purposes
==359== With words that made them known. But thy vild race
==360== (Though thou didst learn) had that in’t which good natures
==361== Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
==362== Deservedly confin’d into this rock,
==363== Who hadst deserv’d more than a prison.

**CAL.**
==364== You taught me language, and my profit on’t
==365== Is, I know how to curse. The red-plague rid you
==366== For learning me your language!

**PROS.**
==366==                   Hag-seed, hence!
==367== Fetch us in fuel, and be quick, thou’rt best,
==368== To answer other business. Shrug’st thou, malice?
==369== If thou neglect’st, or dost unwillingly
==370== What I command, I’ll rack thee with old cramps,
==371== Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
==372== That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

**CAL.**
==372==                   No, pray thee.
*(Aside.)*
==373== I must obey. His art is of such pow’r,
==374== It would control my dam’s god, Setebos,
==375== And make a vassal of him.

**PROS.**
==375==               So, slave, hence!

*Exit Caliban.*

*Enter Ferdinand; and Ariel, invisible, playing and singing.*

*Ariel’s Song*

**ARI.**
==376== *Come unto these yellow sands,*
==377== *And then take hands:*
==378== *Curtsied when you have, and kiss’d,*
==379== *The wild waves whist:*
==380== *Foot it featly here and there,*
==381== *And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.*
==382== *Hark, hark!*
*(Burden, dispersedly, within.)*
==383== *Bow-wow.*
==384== *The watch-dogs bark!*
*(Burden, dispersedly, within.)*
==385== *Bow-wow.*
==386== *Hark, hark, I hear*
==387== *The strain of strutting chanticleer:*
*(Cry within.)*
==388== *Cock-a-diddle-dow.*

**FER.**
==389== Where should this music be? I’ th’ air, or th’ earth?
==390== It sounds no more; and sure it waits upon
==391== Some god o’ th’ island. Sitting on a bank,
==392== Weeping again the King my father’s wrack,
==393== This music crept by me upon the waters,
==394== Allaying both their fury and my passion
==395== With its sweet air; thence I have follow’d it,
==396== Or it hath drawn me rather. But ’tis gone.
==397== No, it begins again.

*Ariel’s Song*

**ARI.**
==398== *Full fathom five thy father lies,*
==399== *Of his bones are coral made:*
==400== *Those are pearls that were his eyes:*
==401== *Nothing of him that doth fade,*
==402== *But doth suffer a sea-change*
==403== *Into something rich and strange.*
==404== *Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:*
*(Burden within.)*
==405== *Ding-dong.*
==406== *Hark now I hear them—ding-dong bell.*

**FER.**
==407== The ditty does remember my drown’d father.
==408== This is no mortal business, nor no sound
==409== That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

**PROS.**
==410== The fringed curtains of thine eye advance,
==411== And say what thou seest yond.

**MIR.**
==411==                 What, is’t a spirit?
==412== Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
==413== It carries a brave form. But ’tis a spirit.

**PROS.**
==414== No, wench, it eats, and sleeps, and hath such senses
==415== As we have—such. This gallant which thou seest
==416== Was in the wrack; and but he’s something stain’d
==417== With grief (that’s beauty’s canker), thou mightst call him
==418== A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows,
==419== And strays about to find ’em.

**MIR.**
==419==                 I might call him
==420== A thing divine, for nothing natural
==421== I ever saw so noble.

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
==421==            It goes on, I see,
==422== As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit, I’ll free thee
==423== Within two days for this.

**FER.**
==423==               Most sure, the goddess
==424== On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my pray’r
==425== May know if you remain upon this island,
==426== And that you will some good instruction give
==427== How I may bear me here. My prime request,
==428== Which I do last pronounce, is (O you wonder!) 
==429== If you be maid, or no?

**MIR.**
==429==               No wonder, sir,
==430== But certainly a maid.

**FER.**
==430==            My language? Heavens!
==431== I am the best of them that speak this speech,
==432== Were I but where ’tis spoken.

**PROS.**
==432==                 How? The best?
==433== What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

**FER.**
==434== A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
==435== To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me,
==436== And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples,
==437== Who with mine eyes (never since at ebb) beheld
==438== The King my father wrack’d.

**MIR.**
==438==                 Alack, for mercy!

**FER.**
==439== Yes, faith, and all his lords, the Duke of Milan
==440== And his brave son being twain.

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
==440==                   The Duke of Milan
==441== And his more braver daughter could control thee,
==442== If now ’twere fit to do’t. At the first sight
==443== They have chang’d eyes. Delicate Ariel,
==444== I’ll set thee free for this.—A word, good sir,
==445== I fear you have done yourself some wrong; a word.

**MIR.**
==446== Why speaks my father so ungently? This
==447== Is the third man that e’er I saw; the first
==448== That e’er I sigh’d for. Pity move my father
==449== To be inclin’d my way!

**FER.**
==449==               O, if a virgin,
==450== And your affection not gone forth, I’ll make you
==451== The Queen of Naples.

**PROS.**
==451==            Soft, sir, one word more.
*(Aside.)*
==452== They are both in either’s pow’rs; but this swift business
==453== I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
==454== Make the prize light.—One word more: I charge thee
==455== That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp
==456== The name thou ow’st not, and hast put thyself
==457== Upon this island as a spy, to win it
==458== From me, the lord on’t.

**FER.**
==458==               No, as I am a man.

**MIR.**
==459== There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple.
==460== If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
==461== Good things will strive to dwell with’t.

**PROS.**
==461==                      Follow me.⁠—
==462== Speak not you for him; he’s a traitor.—Come,
==463== I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together.
==464== Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
==465== The fresh-brook mussels, wither’d roots, and husks
==466== Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

**FER.**
==466==                   No,
==467== I will resist such entertainment till
==468== Mine enemy has more pow’r.

*He draws, and is charmed from moving.*

**MIR.**
==468==                 O dear father,
==469== Make not too rash a trial of him, for
==470== He’s gentle, and not fearful.

**PROS.**
==470==                 What, I say,
==471== My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor,
==472== Who mak’st a show but dar’st not strike, thy conscience
==473== Is so possess’d with guilt. Come, from thy ward,
==474== For I can here disarm thee with this stick,
==475== And make thy weapon drop.

**MIR.**
==475==               Beseech you, father.

**PROS.**
==476== Hence! Hang not on my garments.

**MIR.**
==476==                   Sir, have pity,
==477== I’ll be his surety.

**PROS.**
==477==         Silence! One word more
==478== Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What,
==479== An advocate for an impostor? Hush!
==480== Thou think’st there is no more such shapes as he,
==481== Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench,
==482== To th’ most of men this is a Caliban,
==483== And they to him are angels.

**MIR.**
==483==               My affections
==484== Are then most humble; I have no ambition
==485== To see a goodlier man.

**PROS.**
*(To Ferdinand.)*
==486== Come on, obey:
==487== Thy nerves are in their infancy again
==488== And have no vigor in them.

**FER.**
==488==                 So they are.
==489== My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
==490== My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,
==491== The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats
==492== To whom I am subdu’d, are but light to me,
==493== Might I but through my prison once a day
==494== Behold this maid. All corners else o’ th’ earth
==495== Let liberty make use of; space enough
==496== Have I in such a prison.

**PROS.**
*(Aside.)*
==496==               It works.
*(To Ferdinand.)*
==496==                      Come on.⁠—
==497== Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
*(To Ferdinand.)*
==497==                   Follow me.
*(To Ariel.)*
==498== Hark what thou else shalt do me.

**MIR.**
==498==                   Be of comfort,
==499== My father’s of a better nature, sir,
==500== Than he appears by speech. This is unwonted
==501== Which now came from him.

**PROS.**
==501==               Thou shalt be as free
==502== As mountain winds; but then exactly do
==503== All points of my command.

**ARI.**
==503==               To th’ syllable.

**PROS.**
*(To Ferdinand.)*
==504== Come, follow.
*(To Miranda.)*
==504==         Speak not for him.

*Exeunt.*
