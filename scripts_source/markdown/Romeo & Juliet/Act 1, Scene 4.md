## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 1, Scene 5|Act 1, Scene 5 →]]

*Verona. A street.*

*Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers; Torch-Bearers.*

**ROM.**
==1== What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
==2== Or shall we on without apology?

**BEN.**
==3== The date is out of such prolixity:
==4== We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
==5== Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,
==6== Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper,
==7== Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
==8== After the prompter, for our entrance;
==9== But let them measure us by what they will,
==10== We’ll measure them a measure and be gone.

**ROM.**
==11== Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;
==12== Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

**MER.**
==13== Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

**ROM.**
==14== Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
==15== With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead
==16== So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

**MER.**
==17== You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,
==18== And soar with them above a common bound.

**ROM.**
==19== I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
==20== To soar with his light feathers, and so bound
==21== I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe;
==22== Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.

**MER.**
==23== And, to sink in it, should you burden love⁠—
==24== Too great oppression for a tender thing.

**ROM.**
==25== Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
==26== Too rude, too boist’rous, and it pricks like thorn.

**MER.**
==27== If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
==28== Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
==29== Give me a case to put my visage in,
*(Puts on a mask.)*
==30== A visor for a visor! What care I
==31== What curious eye doth cote deformities?
==32== Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

**BEN.**
==33== Come knock and enter, and no sooner in,
==34== But every man betake him to his legs.

**ROM.**
==35== A torch for me. Let wantons light of heart
==36== Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels.
==37== For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
==38== I’ll be a candle-holder and look on:
==39== The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.

**MER.**
==40== Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word.
==41== If thou art Dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire
==42== Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stickest
==43== Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

**ROM.**
==44== Nay, that’s not so.

**MER.**
==44==            I mean, sir, in delay
==45== We waste our lights in vain, like lights by day!
==46== Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
==47== Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

**ROM.**
==48== And we mean well in going to this mask,
==49== But ’tis no wit to go.

**MER.**
==49==            Why, may one ask?

**ROM.**
==50== I dreamt a dream tonight.

**MER.**
==50==               And so did I.

**ROM.**
==51== Well, what was yours?

**MER.**
==51==            That dreamers often lie.

**ROM.**
==52== In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

**MER.**
==53== O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
==54== She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
==55== In shape no bigger than an agot-stone
==56== On the forefinger of an alderman,
==57== Drawn with a team of little atomi
==58== Over men’s noses as they lie asleep.
==59== Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
==60== Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
==61== Time out a’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
==62== Her wagon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs,
==63== The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
==64== Her traces of the smallest spider web,
==65== Her collars of the moonshine’s wat’ry beams,
==66== Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,
==67== Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
==68== Not half so big as a round little worm
==69== Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid.
==70== And in this state she gallops night by night
==71== Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
==72== O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on cur’sies straight;
==73== O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
==74== O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
==75== Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
==76== Because their breath with sweetmeats tainted are.
==77== Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
==78== And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
==79== And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail
==80== Tickling a parson’s nose as ’a lies asleep,
==81== Then he dreams of another benefice.
==82== Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
==83== And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
==84== Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
==85== Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
==86== Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
==87== And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
==88== And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
==89== That plats the manes of horses in the night,
==90== And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
==91== Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.
==92== This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
==93== That presses them and learns them first to bear,
==94== Making them women of good carriage.
==95== This is she⁠—

**ROM.**
==95==         Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
==96== Thou talk’st of nothing.

**MER.**
==96==            True, I talk of dreams,
==97== Which are the children of an idle brain,
==98== Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
==99== Which is as thin of substance as the air,
==100== And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
==101== Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
==102== And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
==103== Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.

**BEN.**
==104== This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
==105== Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

**ROM.**
==106== I fear, too early, for my mind misgives
==107== Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
==108== Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
==109== With this night’s revels, and expire the term
==110== Of a despised life clos’d in my breast
==111== By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
==112== But He that hath the steerage of my course
==113== Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!

**BEN.**
==114== Strike, drum.

*They march about the stage and stand to one side.*
