## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Verona. A room in Capulet’s house.*

*Enter Capulet’s Wife, and Nurse.*

**L. CAP.**
==1== Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.

**NURSE.**
==2== Now by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
==3== I bade her come. What, lamb! What, ladybird!
==4== God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!

*Enter Juliet.*

**JUL.**
==5== How now, who calls?

**NURSE.**
==5==            Your mother.

**JUL.**
==5==                   Madam, I am here,
==6== What is your will?

**L. CAP.**
==7== This is the matter. Nurse, give leave a while,
==8== We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,
==9== I have rememb’red me, thou s’ hear our counsel.
==10== Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.

**NURSE.**
==11== Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

**L. CAP.**
==12== She’s not fourteen.

**NURSE.**
==12==            I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth⁠—
==13== And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four⁠—
==14== She’s not fourteen. How long is it now
==15== To Lammas-tide?

**L. CAP.**
==15==            A fortnight and odd days.

**NURSE.**
==16== Even or odd, of all days in the year,
==17== Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
==18== Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!⁠—
==19== Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God,
==20== She was too good for me. But as I said,
==21== On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen,
==22== That shall she, marry, I remember it well.
==23== ’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,
==24== And she was wean’d—I never shall forget it⁠—
==25== Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
==26== For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
==27== Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall.
==28== My lord and you were then at Mantua⁠—
==29== Nay, I do bear a brain—but as I said,
==30== When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
==31== Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
==32== To see it tetchy and fall out wi’ th’ dug!
==33== Shake, quoth the dove-house; ’twas no need, I trow,
==34== To bid me trudge.
==35== And since that time it is eleven years,
==36== For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th’ rood,
==37== She could have run and waddled all about;
==38== For even the day before, she broke her brow,
==39== And then my husband—God be with his soul!
==40== ’A was a merry man—took up the child.
==41== “Yea,” quoth he, “dost thou fall upon thy face?
==42== Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,
==43== Wilt thou not, Jule?” and by my holidam,
==44== The pretty wretch left crying and said, “Ay.”
==45== To see now how a jest shall come about!
==46== I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,
==47== I never should forget it: “Wilt thou not, Jule?” quoth he;
==48== And, pretty fool, it stinted and said, “Ay.”

**L. CAP.**
==49== Enough of this, I pray thee hold thy peace.

**NURSE.**
==50== Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh
==51== To think it should leave crying and say, “Ay.”
==52== And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
==53== A bump as big as a young cock’rel’s stone⁠—
==54== A perilous knock—and it cried bitterly.
==55== “Yea,” quoth my husband, “fall’st upon thy face?
==56== Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age,
==57== Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said, “Ay.”

**JUL.**
==58== And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

**NURSE.**
==59== Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
==60== Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d.
==61== And I might live to see thee married once,
==62== I have my wish.

**L. CAP.**
==63== Marry, that “marry” is the very theme
==64== I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
==65== How stands your dispositions to be married?

**JUL.**
==66== It is an honor that I dream not of.

**NURSE.**
==67== An honor! Were not I thine only nurse,
==68== I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.

**L. CAP.**
==69== Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
==70== Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
==71== Are made already mothers. By my count,
==72== I was your mother much upon these years
==73== That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
==74== The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

**NURSE.**
==75== A man, young lady! Lady, such a man
==76== As all the world—why, he’s a man of wax.

**L. CAP.**
==77== Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.

**NURSE.**
==78== Nay, he’s a flower, in faith, a very flower.

**L. CAP.**
==79== What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
==80== This night you shall behold him at our feast;
==81== Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,
==82== And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen;
==83== Examine every married lineament,
==84== And see how one another lends content;
==85== And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies
==86== Find written in the margent of his eyes.
==87== This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
==88== To beautify him, only lacks a cover.
==89== The fish lives in the sea, and ’tis much pride
==90== For fair without the fair within to hide.
==91== That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,
==92== That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
==93== So shall you share all that he doth possess,
==94== By having him, making yourself no less.

**NURSE.**
==95== No less! Nay, bigger: women grow by men.

**L. CAP.**
==96== Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?

**JUL.**
==97== I’ll look to like, if looking liking move;
==98== But no more deep will I endart mine eye
==99== Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

*Enter First Servingman.*

**1. SERV.**
==100== Madam, the guests are come, supper serv’d up, you call’d, my young lady ask’d for, the nurse curs’d in the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must hence to wait; I beseech you follow straight.

*Exit.*

**L. CAP.**
==101== We follow thee. Juliet, the County stays.

**NURSE.**
==102== Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

*Exeunt.*
