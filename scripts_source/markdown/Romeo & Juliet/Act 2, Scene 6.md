## Act 2, Scene 6
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Friar Lawrence’s cell.*

*Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.*

**FRI. L.**
==1== So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
==2== That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!

**ROM.**
==3== Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
==4== It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
==5== That one short minute gives me in her sight.
==6== Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
==7== Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
==8== It is enough I may but call her mine.

**FRI. L.**
==9== These violent delights have violent ends,
==10== And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
==11== Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
==12== Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
==13== And in the taste confounds the appetite.
==14== Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
==15== Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
*(Enter Juliet.)*
==16== Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
==17== Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint;
==18== A lover may bestride the gossamers
==19== That idles in the wanton summer air,
==20== And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

**JUL.**
==21== Good even to my ghostly confessor.

**FRI. L.**
==22== Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

**JUL.**
==23== As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

**ROM.**
==24== Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
==25== Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more
==26== To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
==27== This neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongue
==28== Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
==29== Receive in either by this dear encounter.

**JUL.**
==30== Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
==31== Brags of his substance, not of ornament;
==32== They are but beggars that can count their worth,
==33== But my true love is grown to such excess
==34== I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

**FRI. L.**
==35== Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
==36== For by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
==37== Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.

*Exeunt.*
