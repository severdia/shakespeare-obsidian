## Act 2, Scene 6
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Friar Lawrence’s cell.*

*Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.*

**FRI. L.**
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!

**ROM.**
Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
It is enough I may but call her mine.

**FRI. L.**
These violent delights have violent ends,
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
*(Enter Juliet.)*
Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint;
A lover may bestride the gossamers
That idles in the wanton summer air,
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

**JUL.**
Good even to my ghostly confessor.

**FRI. L.**
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

**JUL.**
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

**ROM.**
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbor air, and let rich music’s tongue
Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.

**JUL.**
Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament;
They are but beggars that can count their worth,
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

**FRI. L.**
Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
For by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.

*Exeunt.*
