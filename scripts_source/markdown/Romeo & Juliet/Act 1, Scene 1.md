## Act 1, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Prologue|← Act 1, Prologue]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Verona. A public place.*

*Enter Sampson and Gregory, with swords and bucklers, of the house of Capulet.*

**SAM.**
==1==Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.

**GRE.**
==2==No, for then we should be colliers.

**SAM.**
==3==I mean, and we be in choler, we’ll draw.

**GRE.**
==4==Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.

**SAM.**
==5==I strike quickly, being mov’d.

**GRE.**
==6==But thou art not quickly mov’d to strike.

**SAM.**
==7==A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

**GRE.**
==8==To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art mov’d, thou run’st away.

**SAM.**
==9==A dog of that house shall move me to stand! I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.

**GRE.**
==10==That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.

**SAM.**
==11==’Tis true, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall; therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.

**GRE.**
==12==The quarrel is between our masters, and us their men.

**SAM.**
==13==’Tis all one; I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids; I will cut off their heads.

**GRE.**
==14==The heads of the maids?

**SAM.**
==15==Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads, take it in what sense thou wilt.

**GRE.**
==16==They must take it in sense that feel it.

**SAM.**
==17==Me they shall feel while I am able to stand, and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

**GRE.**
==18==’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-John. Draw thy tool, here comes two of the house of Montagues.

*Enter two other servingmen: Abram and Balthasar.*

**SAM.**
==19==My naked weapon is out. Quarrel, I will back thee.

**GRE.**
==20==How, turn thy back and run?

**SAM.**
==21==Fear me not.

**GRE.**
==22==No, marry, I fear thee!

**SAM.**
==23==Let us take the law of our sides, let them begin.

**GRE.**
==24==I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.

**SAM.**
==25==Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.

**ABR.**
==26==Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

**SAM.**
==27==I do bite my thumb, sir.

**ABR.**
==28==Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

**SAM.**
*(Aside to Gregory)*
==29==Is the law of our side if I say ay?

**GRE.**
*(Aside to Sampson)*
==30==No.

**SAM.**
==31==No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I bite my thumb, sir.

**GRE.**
==32==Do you quarrel, sir?

**ABR.**
==33==Quarrel, sir? No, sir.

**SAM.**
==34==But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.

**ABR.**
==35==No better?

**SAM.**
==36==Well, sir.

*Enter Benvolio.*

**GRE.**
==37==Say “better,” here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.

**SAM.**
==38==Yes, better, sir.

**ABR.**
==39==You lie.

**SAM.**
==40==Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.

*They fight.*

**BEN.**
==41==Part, fools!
==42==Put up your swords, you know not what you do.

*Beats down their swords.*

*Enter Tybalt.*

**TYB.**
==43==What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
==44==Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

**BEN.**
==45==I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
==46==Or manage it to part these men with me.

**TYB.**
==47==What, drawn and talk of peace? I hate the word
==48==As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
==49==Have at thee, coward!

*They fight.*

*Enter three or four Citizens with clubs or partisans.*

**CITIZENS.**
==50==Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!
==51==Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!

*Enter old Capulet in his gown, and his wife, Lady Capulet.*

**CAP.**
==52==What noise is this? Give me my long sword ho!

**L. CAP.**
==53==A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?

**CAP.**
==54==My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
==55==And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

*Enter old Montague and his wife, Lady Montague.*

**MONT.**
==56==Thou villain Capulet!—Hold me not, let me go.

**L. MONT.**
==57==Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

*Enter Prince Escalus with his Train.*

**PRIN.**
==58==Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
==59==Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel⁠—
==60==Will they not hear?—What ho, you men, you beasts!
==61==That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
==62==With purple fountains issuing from your veins⁠—
==63==On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
==64==Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,
==65==And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
==66==Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
==67==By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
==68==Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
==69==And made Verona’s ancient citizens
==70==Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
==71==To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
==72==Cank’red with peace, to part your cank’red hate;
==73==If ever you disturb our streets again
==74==Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
==75==For this time all the rest depart away.
==76==You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
==77==And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
==78==To know our farther pleasure in this case,
==79==To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
==80==Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

*Exeunt all but Montague, Lady Montague, and Benvolio.*

**MONT.**
==81==Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
==82==Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

**BEN.**
==83==Here were the servants of your adversary,
==84==And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
==85==I drew to part them. In the instant came
==86==The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
==87==Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
==88==He swung about his head and cut the winds,
==89==Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.
==90==While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
==91==Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
==92==Till the Prince came, who parted either part.

**L. MONT.**
==93==O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
==94==Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

**BEN.**
==95==Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun
==96==Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
==97==A troubled mind drive me to walk abroad,
==98==Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
==99==That westward rooteth from this city side,
==100==So early walking did I see your son.
==101==Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
==102==And stole into the covert of the wood.
==103==I, measuring his affections by my own,
==104==Which then most sought where most might not be found,
==105==Being one too many by my weary self,
==106==Pursued my humor not pursuing his,
==107==And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.

**MONT.**
==108==Many a morning hath he there been seen,
==109==With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
==110==Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs,
==111==But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
==112==Should in the farthest east begin to draw
==113==The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
==114==Away from light steals home my heavy son,
==115==And private in his chamber pens himself,
==116==Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
==117==And makes himself an artificial night.
==118==Black and portendous must this humor prove,
==119==Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

**BEN.**
==120==My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

**MONT.**
==121==I neither know it, nor can learn of him.

**BEN.**
==122==Have you importun’d him by any means?

**MONT.**
==123==Both by myself and many other friends,
==124==But he, his own affections’ counselor,
==125==Is to himself (I will not say how true) 
==126==But to himself so secret and so close,
==127==So far from sounding and discovery,
==128==As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
==129==Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
==130==Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
==131==Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
==132==We would as willingly give cure as know.

*Enter Romeo.*

**BEN.**
==133==See where he comes. So please you step aside,
==134==I’ll know his grievance, or be much denied.

**MONT.**
==135==I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
==136==To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away.

*Exeunt Montague and Lady.*

**BEN.**
==137==Good morrow, cousin.

**ROM.**
==137==           Is the day so young?

**BEN.**
==138==But new struck nine.

**ROM.**
==138==           Ay me, sad hours seem long.
==139==Was that my father that went hence so fast?

**BEN.**
==140==It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?

**ROM.**
==141==Not having that which, having, makes them short.

**BEN.**
==142==In love?

**ROM.**
==143==Out⁠—

**BEN.**
==144==Of love?

**ROM.**
==145==Out of her favor where I am in love.

**BEN.**
==146==Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
==147==Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

**ROM.**
==148==Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
==149==Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
==150==Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
==151==Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all:
==152==Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.
==153==Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
==154==O any thing, of nothing first create!
==155==O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
==156==Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,
==157==Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
==158==Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
==159==This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
==160==Dost thou not laugh?

**BEN.**
==160==           No, coz, I rather weep.

**ROM.**
==161==Good heart, at what?

**BEN.**
==161==           At thy good heart’s oppression.

**ROM.**
==162==Why, such is love’s transgression.
==163==Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
==164==Which thou wilt propagate to have it press’d
==165==With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
==166==Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
==167==Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs,
==168==Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes,
==169==Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with loving tears.
==170==What is it else? A madness most discreet,
==171==A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
==172==Farewell, my coz.

**BEN.**
==172==           Soft, I will go along;
==173==And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

**ROM.**
==174==Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here:
==175==This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.

**BEN.**
==176==Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?

**ROM.**
==177==What, shall I groan and tell thee?

**BEN.**
==177==                  Groan? Why, no;
==178==But sadly tell me, who?

**ROM.**
==179==Bid a sick man in sadness make his will⁠—
==180==A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill!
==181==In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

**BEN.**
==182==I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.

**ROM.**
==183==A right good mark-man! And she’s fair I love.

**BEN.**
==184==A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

**ROM.**
==185==Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
==186==With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;
==187==And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,
==188==From Love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
==189==She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
==190==Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes,
==191==Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
==192==O, she is rich in beauty, only poor
==193==That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

**BEN.**
==194==Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

**ROM.**
==195==She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
==196==For beauty starv’d with her severity
==197==Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
==198==She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
==199==To merit bliss by making me despair.
==200==She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
==201==Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

**BEN.**
==202==Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.

**ROM.**
==203==O, teach me how I should forget to think.

**BEN.**
==204==By giving liberty unto thine eyes:
==205==Examine other beauties.

**ROM.**
==205==              ’Tis the way
==206==To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
==207==These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
==208==Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.
==209==He that is strucken blind cannot forget
==210==The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
==211==Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
==212==What doth her beauty serve but as a note
==213==Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?
==214==Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.

**BEN.**
==215==I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

*Exeunt.*
