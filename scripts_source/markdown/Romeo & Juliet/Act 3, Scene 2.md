## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Capulet’s orchard.*

*Enter Juliet alone.*

**JUL.**
==1==Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
==2==Towards Phoebus’ lodging; such a wagoner
==3==As Phaëton would whip you to the west,
==4==And bring in cloudy night immediately.
==5==Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
==6==That th’ runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo
==7==Leap to these arms untalk’d of and unseen!
==8==Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
==9==By their own beauties, or, if love be blind,
==10==It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
==11==Thou sober-suited matron all in black,
==12==And learn me how to lose a winning match,
==13==Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
==14==Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
==15==With thy black mantle, till strange love grow bold,
==16==Think true love acted simple modesty.
==17==Come, night, come, Romeo, come, thou day in night,
==18==For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night,
==19==Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
==20==Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow’d night,
==21==Give me my Romeo, and, when I shall die,
==22==Take him and cut him out in little stars,
==23==And he will make the face of heaven so fine
==24==That all the world will be in love with night,
==25==And pay no worship to the garish sun.
==26==O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
==27==But not possess’d it, and though I am sold,
==28==Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day
==29==As is the night before some festival
==30==To an impatient child that hath new robes
==31==And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
*(Enter Nurse wringing her hands, with the ladder of cords in her lap.)*
==32==And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
==33==But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.
==34==Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? The cords
==35==That Romeo bid thee fetch?

**NURSE.**
==35==                Ay, ay, the cords.

*Throws them down.*

**JUL.**
==36==Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?

**NURSE.**
==37==Ah, weraday, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
==38==We are undone, lady, we are undone!
==39==Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead!

**JUL.**
==40==Can heaven be so envious?

**NURSE.**
==40==              Romeo can,
==41==Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
==42==Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

**JUL.**
==43==What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
==44==This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
==45==Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but ay,
==46==And that bare vowel I shall poison more
==47==Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
==48==I am not I, if there be such an ay,
==49==Or those eyes shut, that makes thee answer ay.
==50==If he be slain, say ay, or if not, no.
==51==Brief sounds determine my weal or woe.

**NURSE.**
==52==I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes⁠—
==53==God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
==54==A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse,
==55==Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
==56==All in gore blood; I swooned at the sight.

**JUL.**
==57==O, break, my heart, poor bankrupt, break at once!
==58==To prison, eyes, ne’er look on liberty!
==59==Vile earth, to earth resign, end motion here,
==60==And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

**NURSE.**
==61==O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
==62==O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,
==63==That ever I should live to see thee dead!

**JUL.**
==64==What storm is this that blows so contrary?
==65==Is Romeo slaught’red? And is Tybalt dead?
==66==My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
==67==Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom,
==68==For who is living, if those two are gone?

**NURSE.**
==69==Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
==70==Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.

**JUL.**
==71==O God, did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?

**NURSE.**
==72==It did, it did, alas the day, it did!

**JUL.**
==73==O serpent heart, hid with a flow’ring face!
==74==Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
==75==Beautiful tyrant! Fiend angelical!
==76==Dove-feather’d raven! Wolvish ravening lamb!
==77==Despised substance of divinest show!
==78==Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
==79==A damned saint, an honorable villain!
==80==O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
==81==When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
==82==In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
==83==Was ever book containing such vile matter
==84==So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
==85==In such a gorgeous palace!

**NURSE.**
==85==              There’s no trust,
==86==No faith, no honesty in men, all perjur’d,
==87==All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
==88==Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua-vitae;
==89==These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
==90==Shame come to Romeo!

**JUL.**
==90==              Blister’d be thy tongue
==91==For such a wish! He was not born to shame:
==92==Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
==93==For ’tis a throne where honor may be crown’d
==94==Sole monarch of the universal earth.
==95==O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

**NURSE.**
==96==Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?

**JUL.**
==97==Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
==98==Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
==99==When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
==100==But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
==101==That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
==102==Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
==103==Your tributary drops belong to woe,
==104==Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
==105==My husband lives that Tybalt would have slain,
==106==And Tybalt’s dead that would have slain my husband.
==107==All this is comfort, wherefore weep I then?
==108==Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
==109==That murd’red me; I would forget it fain,
==110==But O, it presses to my memory
==111==Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds:
==112==“Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.”
==113==That “banished,” that one word “banished,”
==114==Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
==115==Was woe enough if it had ended there;
==116==Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
==117==And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
==118==Why followed not, when she said, “Tybalt’s dead,”
==119==Thy father or thy mother, nay, or both,
==120==Which modern lamentation might have moved?
==121==But with a rearward following Tybalt’s death,
==122==“Romeo is banished”: to speak that word,
==123==Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
==124==All slain, all dead: “Romeo is banished”!
==125==There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
==126==In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
==127==Where is my father and my mother, nurse?

**NURSE.**
==128==Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.
==129==Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

**JUL.**
==130==Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
==131==When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.
==132==Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,
==133==Both you and I, for Romeo is exil’d.
==134==He made you for a highway to my bed,
==135==But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
==136==Come, cords, come, nurse, I’ll to my wedding-bed,
==137==And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

**NURSE.**
==138==Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo
==139==To comfort you, I wot well where he is.
==140==Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
==141==I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.

**JUL.**
==142==O, find him! Give this ring to my true knight,
==143==And bid him come to take his last farewell.

*Exeunt.*
