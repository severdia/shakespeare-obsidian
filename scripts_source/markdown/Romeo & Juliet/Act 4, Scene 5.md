## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Juliet’s chamber.*

**NURSE.**
==1== Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet!—Fast, I warrant her, she.⁠—
==2== Why, lamb! Why, lady! Fie, you slug-a-bed!
==3== Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweet heart! Why, bride!
==4== What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now;
==5== Sleep for a week, for the next night, I warrant,
==6== The County Paris hath set up his rest
==7== That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
==8== Marry and amen! How sound is she asleep!
==9== I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
==10== Ay, let the County take you in your bed,
==11== He’ll fright you up, i’ faith. Will it not be?
*(Draws back the curtains.)*
==12== What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?
==13== I must needs wake you. Lady, lady, lady!
==14== Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!
==15== O, weraday, that ever I was born!
==16== Some aqua-vitae ho! My lord! My lady!

*Enter Mother, Lady Capulet.*

**L. CAP.**
==17== What noise is here?

**NURSE.**
==17==            O lamentable day!

**L. CAP.**
==18== What is the matter?

**NURSE.**
==18==            Look, look! O heavy day!

**L. CAP.**
==19== O me, O me, my child, my only life!
==20== Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
==21== Help, help! Call help.

*Enter Father Capulet.*

**CAP.**
==22== For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.

**NURSE.**
==23== She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead, alack the day!

**L. CAP.**
==24== Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!

**CAP.**
==25== Hah, let me see her. Out alas, she’s cold,
==26== Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
==27== Life and these lips have long been separated.
==28== Death lies on her like an untimely frost
==29== Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

**NURSE.**
==30== O lamentable day!

**L. CAP.**
==30==            O woeful time!

**CAP.**
==31== Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
==32== Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.

*Enter Friar Lawrence and the County Paris with the Musicians.*

**FRI. L.**
==33== Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

**CAP.**
==34== Ready to go, but never to return.⁠—
==35== O son, the night before thy wedding-day
==36== Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
==37== Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
==38== Death is my son-in-law. Death is my heir,
==39== My daughter he hath wedded. I will die,
==40== And leave him all; life, living, all is Death’s.

**PAR.**
==41== Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,
==42== And doth it give me such a sight as this?

**L. CAP.**
==43== Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
==44== Most miserable hour that e’er time saw
==45== In lasting labor of his pilgrimage!
==46== But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
==47== But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
==48== And cruel Death hath catch’d it from my sight!

**NURSE.**
==49== O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day!
==50== Most lamentable day, most woeful day
==51== That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
==52== O day, O day, O day, O hateful day!
==53== Never was seen so black a day as this.
==54== O woeful day, O woeful day!

**PAR.**
==55== Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
==56== Most detestable Death, by thee beguil’d,
==57== By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
==58== O love, O life! Not life, but love in death!

**CAP.**
==59== Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d!
==60== Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now
==61== To murder, murder our solemnity?
==62== O child, O child! My soul, and not my child!
==63== Dead art thou! Alack, my child is dead,
==64== And with my child my joys are buried.

**FRI. L.**
==65== Peace ho, for shame! Confusion’s cure lives not
==66== In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
==67== Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
==68== And all the better is it for the maid.
==69== Your part in her you could not keep from death,
==70== But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
==71== The most you sought was her promotion,
==72== For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,
==73== And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
==74== Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
==75== O, in this love, you love your child so ill
==76== That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
==77== She’s not well married that lives married long,
==78== But she’s best married that dies married young.
==79== Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
==80== On this fair corse, and as the custom is,
==81== And in her best array, bear her to church;
==82== For though fond nature bids us all lament,
==83== Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.

**CAP.**
==84== All things that we ordained festival,
==85== Turn from their office to black funeral:
==86== Our instruments to melancholy bells,
==87== Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
==88== Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
==89== Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
==90== And all things change them to the contrary.

**FRI. L.**
==91== Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him;
==92== And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
==93== To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
==94== The heavens do low’r upon you for some ill;
==95== Move them no more by crossing their high will.

*They all, but the Nurse and the Musicians, go forth, casting rosemary on her, and shutting the curtains.*

**1. MUS.**
==96== Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.

**NURSE.**
==97== Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
==98== For well you know this is a pitiful case.

*Exit.*

**1. MUS.**
==99== Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

*Enter Peter.*

**PET.**
==100== Musicians, O musicians, “Heart’s ease,” “Heart’s ease”! O, and you will have me live, play “Heart’s ease.”

**1. MUS.**
==101== Why “Heart’s ease”?

**PET.**
==102== O musicians, because my heart itself plays “My heart is full.” O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.

**1. MUS.**
==103== Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.

**PET.**
==104== You will not then?

**1. MUS.**
==105== No.

**PET.**
==106== I will then give it you soundly.

**1. MUS.**
==107== What will you give us?

**PET.**
==108== No money, on my faith, but the gleek; I will give you the minstrel.

**1. MUS.**
==109== Then will I give you the serving-creature.

**PET.**
==110== Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will carry no crotchets, I’ll *re* you, I’ll *fa* you. Do you note me?

**1. MUS.**
==111== And you *re* us and *fa* us, you note us.

**2. MUS.**
==112== Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

**PET.**
==113== Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men:
==114== *“When griping griefs the heart doth wound,*
==115== *And doleful dumps the mind oppress,*
==116== *Then music with her silver sound”⁠—*
==117== Why “silver sound”? Why “music with her silver sound”? What say you, Simon Catling?

**1. MUS.**
==118== Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

**PET.**
==119== Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

**2. MUS.**
==120== I say, “silver sound,” because musicians sound for silver.

**PET.**
==121== Pretty too! What say you, James Sound-post?

**3. MUS.**
==122== Faith, I know not what to say.

**PET.**
==123== O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer; I will say for you; it is “music with her silver sound,” because musicians have no gold for sounding:
==124== *“Then music with her silver sound*
==125== *With speedy help doth lend redress.”*

*Exit.*

**1. MUS.**
==126== What a pestilent knave is this same!

**2. MUS.**
==127== Hang him. Jack! Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.

*Exeunt.*
