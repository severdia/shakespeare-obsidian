## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*A hall in Capulet’s house.*

*Enter lady of the house Lady Capulet and Nurse with herbs.*

**L. CAP.**
Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.

**NURSE.**
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

*Enter old Capulet.*

**CAP.**
Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crowed,
The curfew-bell hath rung, ’tis three a’ clock.
Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica,
Spare not for cost.

**NURSE.**
           Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed. Faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow
For this night’s watching.

**CAP.**
No, not a whit. What, I have watch’d ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.

**L. CAP.**
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,
But I will watch you from such watching now.

*Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.*

**CAP.**
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
*(Enter three or four Servingmen with spits and logs and baskets.)*
Now, fellow, what is there?

**1. SERV.**
Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.

**CAP.**
Make haste, make haste.
*(Exit First Servant.)*
              Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

**2. SERV.**
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
And never trouble Peter for the matter.

**CAP.**
Mass, and well said, a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head.
*(Exit Second Servant.)*
              Good faith, ’tis day.
The County will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would.
*(Play music within.)*
              I hear him near.
Nurse! Wife! What ho! What, nurse, I say!
*(Enter Nurse.)*
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up,
I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
Make haste, the bridegroom he is come already,
Make haste, I say.

*Exit.*
