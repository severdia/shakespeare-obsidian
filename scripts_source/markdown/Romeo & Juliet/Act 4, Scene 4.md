## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*A hall in Capulet’s house.*

*Enter lady of the house Lady Capulet and Nurse with herbs.*

**L. CAP.**
==1==Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.

**NURSE.**
==2==They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

*Enter old Capulet.*

**CAP.**
==3==Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crowed,
==4==The curfew-bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.
==5==Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica,
==6==Spare not for cost.

**NURSE.**
==6==           Go, you cot-quean, go,
==7==Get you to bed. Faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow
==8==For this night’s watching.

**CAP.**
==9==No, not a whit. What, I have watch’d ere now
==10==All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.

**L. CAP.**
==11==Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time,
==12==But I will watch you from such watching now.

*Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.*

**CAP.**
==13==A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
*(Enter three or four Servingmen with spits and logs and baskets.)*
==14==Now, fellow, what is there?

**1. SERV.**
==15==Things for the cook, sir, but I know not what.

**CAP.**
==16==Make haste, make haste.
*(Exit First Servant.)*
==16==              Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
==17==Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

**2. SERV.**
==18==I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
==19==And never trouble Peter for the matter.

**CAP.**
==20==Mass, and well said, a merry whoreson, ha!
==21==Thou shalt be logger-head.
*(Exit Second Servant.)*
==21==              Good faith, ’tis day.
==22==The County will be here with music straight,
==23==For so he said he would.
*(Play music within.)*
==23==              I hear him near.
==24==Nurse! Wife! What ho! What, nurse, I say!
*(Enter Nurse.)*
==25==Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up,
==26==I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
==27==Make haste, the bridegroom he is come already,
==28==Make haste, I say.

*Exit.*
