## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A hall in Capulet’s house.*

*Enter Capulet, Mother Lady Capulet, Nurse, and Servingmen, two or three.*

**CAP.**
So many guests invite as here are writ.
*(Exit First Servant.)*
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

**2. SERV.**
You shall have none ill, sir, for I’ll try if they can lick their fingers.

**CAP.**
How canst thou try them so?

**2. SERV.**
Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers; therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.

**CAP.**
Go, be gone.
*(Exit Second Servant.)*
We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?

**NURSE.**
Ay forsooth.

**CAP.**
Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.

*Enter Juliet.*

**NURSE.**
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

**CAP.**
How now, my headstrong, where have you been gadding?

**JUL.**
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin’d
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here
To beg your pardon.
*(She kneels down.)*
Pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.

**CAP.**
Send for the County, go tell him of this.
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.

**JUL.**
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.

**CAP.**
Why, I am glad on’t, this is well, stand up.
This is as’t should be. Let me see the County;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.

**JUL.**
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?

**L. CAP.**
No, not till Thursday, there is time enough.

**CAP.**
Go, nurse, go with her, we’ll to church tomorrow.

*Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.*

**L. CAP.**
We shall be short in our provision,
’Tis now near night.

**CAP.**
           Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife;
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
I’ll not to bed tonight; let me alone,
I’ll play the huswife for this once. What ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare up him
Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.

*Exeunt.*
