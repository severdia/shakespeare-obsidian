## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A hall in Capulet’s house.*

*Enter Capulet, Mother Lady Capulet, Nurse, and Servingmen, two or three.*

**CAP.**
==1==So many guests invite as here are writ.
*(Exit First Servant.)*
==2==Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

**2. SERV.**
==3==You shall have none ill, sir, for I’ll try if they can lick their fingers.

**CAP.**
==4==How canst thou try them so?

**2. SERV.**
==5==Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers; therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.

**CAP.**
==6==Go, be gone.
*(Exit Second Servant.)*
==7==We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
==8==What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?

**NURSE.**
==9==Ay forsooth.

**CAP.**
==10==Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
==11==A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.

*Enter Juliet.*

**NURSE.**
==12==See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

**CAP.**
==13==How now, my headstrong, where have you been gadding?

**JUL.**
==14==Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
==15==Of disobedient opposition
==16==To you and your behests, and am enjoin’d
==17==By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here
==18==To beg your pardon.
*(She kneels down.)*
==19==Pardon, I beseech you!
==20==Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.

**CAP.**
==21==Send for the County, go tell him of this.
==22==I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.

**JUL.**
==23==I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,
==24==And gave him what becomed love I might,
==25==Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.

**CAP.**
==26==Why, I am glad on’t, this is well, stand up.
==27==This is as’t should be. Let me see the County;
==28==Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
==29==Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
==30==All our whole city is much bound to him.

**JUL.**
==31==Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
==32==To help me sort such needful ornaments
==33==As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?

**L. CAP.**
==34==No, not till Thursday, there is time enough.

**CAP.**
==35==Go, nurse, go with her, we’ll to church tomorrow.

*Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.*

**L. CAP.**
==36==We shall be short in our provision,
==37==’Tis now near night.

**CAP.**
==37==           Tush, I will stir about,
==38==And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife;
==39==Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
==40==I’ll not to bed tonight; let me alone,
==41==I’ll play the huswife for this once. What ho!
==42==They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
==43==To County Paris, to prepare up him
==44==Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light,
==45==Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.

*Exeunt.*
