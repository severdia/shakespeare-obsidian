## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Prologue|← Act 2, Prologue]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*A lane by the wall of Capulet’s orchard.*

*Enter Romeo alone.*

**ROM.**
==1==Can I go forward when my heart is here?
==2==Turn back, dull earth, and find thy center out.

*Enter Benvolio with Mercutio. Romeo withdraws.*

**BEN.**
==3==Romeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!

**MER.**
==3==                  He is wise,
==4==And, on my life, hath stol’n him home to bed.

**BEN.**
==5==He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.
==6==Call, good Mercutio.

**MER.**
==6==           Nay, I’ll conjure too.
==7==Romeo! Humors! Madman! Passion! Lover!
==8==Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh!
==9==Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
==10==Cry but “Ay me!”, pronounce but “love” and “dove”,
==11==Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
==12==One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
==13==Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim,
==14==When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid!
==15==He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not,
==16==The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
==17==I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
==18==By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
==19==By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
==20==And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
==21==That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

**BEN.**
==22==And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

**MER.**
==23==This cannot anger him; ’twould anger him
==24==To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
==25==Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
==26==Till she had laid it and conjur’d it down.
==27==That were some spite. My invocation
==28==Is fair and honest; in his mistress’ name
==29==I conjure only but to raise up him.

**BEN.**
==30==Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
==31==To be consorted with the humorous night.
==32==Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

**MER.**
==33==If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
==34==Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
==35==And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
==36==As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
==37==O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
==38==An open-arse, thou a pop’rin pear!
==39==Romeo, good night, I’ll to my truckle-bed,
==40==This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
==41==Come, shall we go?

**BEN.**
==41==           Go then, for ’tis in vain
==42==To seek him here that means not to be found.

*Exit with Mercutio.*
