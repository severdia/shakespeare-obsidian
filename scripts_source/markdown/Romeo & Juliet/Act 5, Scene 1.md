## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Mantua. A street.*

*Enter Romeo.*

**ROM.**
==1==If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
==2==My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
==3==My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne,
==4==And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
==5==Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
==6==I dreamt my lady came and found me dead⁠—
==7==Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!⁠—
==8==And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips
==9==That I reviv’d and was an emperor.
==10==Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
==11==When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy!
*(Enter Romeo’s man Balthasar, booted.)*
==12==News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
==13==Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
==14==How doth my lady? Is my father well?
==15==How doth my Juliet? That I ask again,
==16==For nothing can be ill if she be well.

**BAL.**
==17==Then she is well and nothing can be ill:
==18==Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,
==19==And her immortal part with angels lives.
==20==I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
==21==And presently took post to tell it you.
==22==O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
==23==Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

**ROM.**
==24==Is it e’en so? Then I defy you, stars!
==25==Thou knowest my lodging, get me ink and paper,
==26==And hire post-horses; I will hence tonight.

**BAL.**
==27==I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
==28==Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
==29==Some misadventure.

**ROM.**
==29==           Tush, thou art deceiv’d.
==30==Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
==31==Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

**BAL.**
==32==No, my good lord.

**ROM.**
==32==           No matter, get thee gone,
==33==And hire those horses; I’ll be with thee straight.
*(Exit Balthasar.)*
==34==Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
==35==Let’s see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
==36==To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
==37==I do remember an apothecary⁠—
==38==And hereabouts ’a dwells—which late I noted
==39==In tatt’red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
==40==Culling of simples; meager were his looks,
==41==Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
==42==And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
==43==An alligator stuff’d, and other skins
==44==Of ill-shap’d fishes, and about his shelves
==45==A beggarly account of empty boxes,
==46==Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
==47==Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
==48==Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
==49==Noting this penury, to myself I said,
==50==“An’ if a man did need a poison now,
==51==Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
==52==Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.”
==53==O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
==54==And this same needy man must sell it me.
==55==As I remember, this should be the house.
==56==Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
==57==What ho, apothecary!

*Enter Apothecary.*

**AP.**
==57==           Who calls so loud?

**ROM.**
==58==Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
==59==Hold, there is forty ducats; let me have
==60==A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
==61==As will disperse itself through all the veins
==62==That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
==63==And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
==64==As violently as hasty powder fir’d
==65==Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.

**AP.**
==66==Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law
==67==Is death to any he that utters them.

**ROM.**
==68==Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
==69==And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
==70==Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,
==71==Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
==72==The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law,
==73==The world affords no law to make thee rich;
==74==Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

**AP.**
==75==My poverty, but not my will, consents.

**ROM.**
==76==I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

**AP.**
==77==Put this in any liquid thing you will
==78==And drink it off, and if you had the strength
==79==Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

**ROM.**
==80==There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,
==81==Doing more murder in this loathsome world,
==82==Than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
==83==I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
==84==Farewell! Buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
*(Exit Apothecary.)*
==85==Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
==86==To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.

*Exit.*
