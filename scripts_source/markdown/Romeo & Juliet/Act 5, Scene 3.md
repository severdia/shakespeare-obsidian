## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]]

*A churchyard; before a tomb belonging to the Capulets.*

*Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and sweet water and a torch.*

**PAR.**
==1==Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
==2==Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
==3==Under yond yew trees lay thee all along,
==4==Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground,
==5==So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
==6==Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
==7==But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me
==8==As signal that thou hearest something approach.
==9==Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

**PAR. PAGE.**
*(Aside.)*
==10==I am almost afraid to stand alone
==11==Here in the churchyard, yet I will adventure.

*Retires. Paris strews the tomb with flowers.*

**PAR.**
==12==Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew⁠—
==13==O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones!⁠—
==14==Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
==15==Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.
==16==The obsequies that I for thee will keep
==17==Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
*(Whistle Boy.)*
==18==The boy gives warning, something doth approach.
==19==What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
==20==To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
==21==What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, a while.

*Retires.*

*Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock, and a crow of iron.*

**ROM.**
==22==Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
==23==Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
==24==See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
==25==Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
==26==What e’er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof,
==27==And do not interrupt me in my course.
==28==Why I descend into this bed of death
==29==Is partly to behold my lady’s face,
==30==But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
==31==A precious ring—a ring that I must use
==32==In dear employment—therefore hence be gone.
==33==But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
==34==In what I farther shall intend to do,
==35==By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint,
==36==And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
==37==The time and my intents are savage-wild,
==38==More fierce and more inexorable far
==39==Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

**BAL.**
==40==I will be gone, sir, and not trouble ye.

**ROM.**
==41==So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that;
==42==Live and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.

**BAL.**
*(Aside.)*
==43==For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout,
==44==His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

*Retires.*

**ROM.**
==45==Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
==46==Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,
==47==Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
==48==And in despite I’ll cram thee with more food.

*Romeo begins to open the tomb.*

**PAR.**
==49==This is that banish’d haughty Montague,
==50==That murd’red my love’s cousin, with which grief
==51==It is supposed the fair creature died,
==52==And here is come to do some villainous shame
==53==To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
*(Steps forth.)*
==54==Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
==55==Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
==56==Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
==57==Obey and go with me, for thou must die.

**ROM.**
==58==I must indeed, and therefore came I hither.
==59==Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp’rate man.
==60==Fly hence and leave me, think upon these gone,
==61==Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
==62==Put not another sin upon my head,
==63==By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
==64==By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
==65==For I come hither arm’d against myself.
==66==Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say
==67==A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.

**PAR.**
==68==I do defy thy conjuration,
==69==And apprehend thee for a felon here.

**ROM.**
==70==Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!

*They fight.*

**PAR. PAGE.**
==71==O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

*Exit.*

**PAR.**
==72==O, I am slain!
*(Falls.)*
==72==        If thou be merciful,
==73==Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

*Dies.*

**ROM.**
==74==In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
==75==Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!
==76==What said my man, when my betossed soul
==77==Did not attend him as we rode? I think
==78==He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
==79==Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
==80==Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
==81==To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
==82==One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book!
==83==I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
==84==A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth;
==85==For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
==86==This vault a feasting presence full of light.
==87==Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.
*(Laying Paris in the tomb.)*
==88==How oft when men are at the point of death
==89==Have they been merry, which their keepers call
==90==A lightning before death! O how may I
==91==Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,
==92==Death, that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
==93==Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
==94==Thou art not conquer’d, beauty’s ensign yet
==95==Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
==96==And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
==97==Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
==98==O, what more favor can I do to thee,
==99==Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
==100==To sunder his that was thine enemy?
==101==Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
==102==Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
==103==That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
==104==And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
==105==Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
==106==For fear of that, I still will stay with thee,
==107==And never from this palace of dim night
==108==Depart again. Here, here will I remain
==109==With worms that are thy chambermaids; O, here
==110==Will I set up my everlasting rest,
==111==And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
==112==From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
==113==Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you
==114==The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
==115==A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
==116==Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavory guide!
==117==Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
==118==The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
==119==Here’s to my love!
*(Drinks.)*
==119==           O true apothecary!
==120==Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

*Dies.*

*Enter Friar Lawrence with lantern, crow, and spade.*

**FRI. L.**
==121==Saint Francis be my speed! How oft tonight
==122==Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who’s there?

**BAL.**
==123==Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

**FRI. L.**
==124==Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
==125==What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
==126==To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
==127==It burneth in the Capels’ monument.

**BAL.**
==128==It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
==129==One that you love.

**FRI. L.**
==129==           Who is it?

**BAL.**
==129==                     Romeo.

**FRI. L.**
==130==How long hath he been there?

**BAL.**
==130==                Full half an hour.

**FRI. L.**
==131==Go with me to the vault.

**BAL.**
==131==              I dare not, sir.
==132==My master knows not but I am gone hence,
==133==And fearfully did menace me with death
==134==If I did stay to look on his intents.

**FRI. L.**
==135==Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
==136==O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.

**BAL.**
==137==As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
==138==I dreamt my master and another fought,
==139==And that my master slew him.

*Exit.*

**FRI. L.**
==139==                  Romeo!
*(Friar stoops and looks on the blood and weapons.)*
==140==Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
==141==The stony entrance of this sepulcher?
==142==What mean these masterless and gory swords
==143==To lie discolor’d by this place of peace?
*(Enters the tomb.)*
==144==Romeo, O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
==145==And steep’d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
==146==Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
==147==The lady stirs.

*Juliet rises.*

**JUL.**
==148==O comfortable friar! Where is my lord?
==149==I do remember well where I should be,
==150==And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

*Noise within.*

**FRI. L.**
==151==I hear some noise, lady. Come from that nest
==152==Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
==153==A greater power than we can contradict
==154==Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
==155==Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
==156==And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee
==157==Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
==158==Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
==159==Come go, good Juliet,
*(Noise again.)*
==159==           I dare no longer stay.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==160==Go get thee hence, for I will not away.
==161==What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
==162==Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
==163==O churl, drunk all, and left no friendly drop
==164==To help me after? I will kiss thy lips,
==165==Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
==166==To make me die with a restorative.
==167==Thy lips are warm.

**1. WATCH.**
*(Within.)*
==167==           Lead, boy, which way?

**JUL.**
==168==Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger,
*(Taking Romeo’s dagger.)*
==169==This is thy sheath;
*(Stabs herself.)*
==169==           there rust, and let me die.

*Falls on Romeo’s body and dies.*

*Enter Paris’ Page and Watch.*

**PAR. PAGE.**
==170==This is the place, there where the torch doth burn.

**1. WATCH.**
==171==The ground is bloody, search about the churchyard.
==172==Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.
*(Exeunt some.)*
==173==Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
==174==And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
==175==Who here hath lain this two days buried.
==176==Go tell the Prince, run to the Capulets,
==177==Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
*(Exeunt others.)*
==178==We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
==179==But the true ground of all these piteous woes
==180==We cannot without circumstance descry.

*Enter some of the Watch with Romeo’s man, Balthasar.*

**2. WATCH.**
==181==Here’s Romeo’s man, we found him in the churchyard.

**1. WATCH.**
==182==Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.

*Enter Friar Lawrence and another Watchman.*

**3. WATCH.**
==183==Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
==184==We took this mattock and this spade from him,
==185==As he was coming from this churchyard’s side.

**1. WATCH.**
==186==A great suspicion. Stay the friar too.

*Enter the Prince and Attendants.*

**PRIN.**
==187==What misadventure is so early up,
==188==That calls our person from our morning rest?

*Enter Capels (Capulet, Lady Capulet, and others).*

**CAP.**
==189==What should it be that is so shrik’d abroad?

**L. CAP.**
==190==O, the people in the street cry “Romeo,”
==191==Some “Juliet,” and some “Paris,” and all run
==192==With open outcry toward our monument.

**PRIN.**
==193==What fear is this which startles in your ears?

**1. WATCH.**
==194==Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
==195==And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
==196==Warm and new kill’d.

**PRIN.**
==197==Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

**1. WATCH.**
==198==Here is a friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,
==199==With instruments upon them, fit to open
==200==These dead men’s tombs.

**CAP.**
==201==O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
==202==This dagger hath mista’en, for lo his house
==203==Is empty on the back of Montague,
==204==And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom!

**L. CAP.**
==205==O me, this sight of death is as a bell
==206==That warns my old age to a sepulcher.

*Enter Montague and others.*

**PRIN.**
==207==Come, Montague, for thou art early up
==208==To see thy son and heir now early down.

**MONT.**
==209==Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight;
==210==Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
==211==What further woe conspires against mine age?

**PRIN.**
==212==Look and thou shalt see.

**MONT.**
==213==O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
==214==To press before thy father to a grave?

**PRIN.**
==215==Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
==216==Till we can clear these ambiguities,
==217==And know their spring, their head, their true descent,
==218==And then will I be general of your woes,
==219==And lead you even to death. Mean time forbear,
==220==And let mischance be slave to patience.
==221==Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

**FRI. L.**
==222==I am the greatest, able to do least,
==223==Yet most suspected, as the time and place
==224==Doth make against me, of this direful murder;
==225==And here I stand both to impeach and purge
==226==Myself condemned and myself excus’d.

**PRIN.**
==227==Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

**FRI. L.**
==228==I will be brief, for my short date of breath
==229==Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
==230==Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
==231==And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.
==232==I married them, and their stol’n marriage-day
==233==Was Tybalt’s dooms-day, whose untimely death
==234==Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city,
==235==For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
==236==You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
==237==Betroth’d and would have married her perforce
==238==To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
==239==And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
==240==To rid her from this second marriage,
==241==Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
==242==Then gave I her (so tutor’d by my art) 
==243==A sleeping potion, which so took effect
==244==As I intended, for it wrought on her
==245==The form of death. Mean time I writ to Romeo,
==246==That he should hither come as this dire night
==247==To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
==248==Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
==249==But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
==250==Was stayed by accident, and yesternight
==251==Return’d my letter back. Then all alone,
==252==At the prefixed hour of her waking,
==253==Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
==254==Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
==255==Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
==256==But when I came, some minute ere the time
==257==Of her awakening, here untimely lay
==258==The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
==259==She wakes, and I entreated her come forth
==260==And bear this work of heaven with patience.
==261==But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
==262==And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
==263==But as it seems, did violence on herself.
==264==All this I know, and to the marriage
==265==Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
==266==Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
==267==Be sacrific’d some hour before his time,
==268==Unto the rigor of severest law.

**PRIN.**
==269==We still have known thee for a holy man.
==270==Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?

**BAL.**
==271==I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
==272==And then in post he came from Mantua
==273==To this same place, to this same monument.
==274==This letter he early bid me give his father,
==275==And threat’ned me with death, going in the vault,
==276==If I departed not and left him there.

**PRIN.**
==277==Give me the letter, I will look on it.
==278==Where is the County’s page that rais’d the watch?
==279==Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

**PAR. PAGE.**
==280==He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
==281==And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
==282==Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
==283==And by and by my master drew on him,
==284==And then I ran away to call the watch.

**PRIN.**
==285==This letter doth make good the friar’s words,
==286==Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
==287==And here he writes that he did buy a poison
==288==Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
==289==Came to this vault, to die and lie with Juliet.
==290==Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
==291==See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
==292==That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
==293==And I for winking at your discords too
==294==Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.

**CAP.**
==295==O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
==296==This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
==297==Can I demand.

**MONT.**
==297==        But I can give thee more,
==298==For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
==299==That whiles Verona by that name is known,
==300==There shall no figure at such rate be set
==301==As that of true and faithful Juliet.

**CAP.**
==302==As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
==303==Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

**PRIN.**
==304==A glooming peace this morning with it brings,
==305==The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head.
==306==Go hence to have more talk of these sad things;
==307==Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished:
==308==For never was a story of more woe
==309==Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

*Exeunt omnes.*
