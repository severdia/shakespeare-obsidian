## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Friar Lawrence’s cell.*

*Enter Friar Lawrence and County Paris.*

**FRI. L.**
==1== On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.

**PAR.**
==2== My father Capulet will have it so,
==3== And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

**FRI. L.**
==4== You say you do not know the lady’s mind?
==5== Uneven is the course, I like it not.

**PAR.**
==6== Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
==7== And therefore have I little talk’d of love,
==8== For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
==9== Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
==10== That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
==11== And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
==12== To stop the inundation of her tears,
==13== Which, too much minded by herself alone,
==14== May be put from her by society.
==15== Now do you know the reason of this haste.

**FRI. L.**
*(Aside.)*
==16== I would I knew not why it should be slowed.⁠—
==17== Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.

*Enter Juliet.*

**PAR.**
==18== Happily met, my lady and my wife!

**JUL.**
==19== That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

**PAR.**
==20== That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

**JUL.**
==21== What must be shall be.

**FRI. L.**
==21==                 That’s a certain text.

**PAR.**
==22== Come you to make confession to this father?

**JUL.**
==23== To answer that, I should confess to you.

**PAR.**
==24== Do not deny to him that you love me.

**JUL.**
==25== I will confess to you that I love him.

**PAR.**
==26== So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

**JUL.**
==27== If I do so, it will be of more price,
==28== Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

**PAR.**
==29== Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.

**JUL.**
==30== The tears have got small victory by that,
==31== For it was bad enough before their spite.

**PAR.**
==32== Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.

**JUL.**
==33== That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
==34== And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

**PAR.**
==35== Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland’red it.

**JUL.**
==36== It may be so, for it is not mine own.
==37== Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
==38== Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

**FRI. L.**
==39== My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
==40== My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

**PAR.**
==41== God shield I should disturb devotion!
==42== Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye;
==43== Till then *adieu*, and keep this holy kiss.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==44== O, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
==45== Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!

**FRI. L.**
==46== O Juliet, I already know thy grief,
==47== It strains me past the compass of my wits.
==48== I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
==49== On Thursday next be married to this County.

**JUL.**
==50== Tell me not, friar, that thou hearest of this,
==51== Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
==52== If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
==53== Do thou but call my resolution wise,
==54== And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
==55== God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands,
==56== And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,
==57== Shall be the label to another deed,
==58== Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
==59== Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
==60== Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,
==61== Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
==62== ’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
==63== Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
==64== Which the commission of thy years and art
==65== Could to no issue of true honor bring.
==66== Be not so long to speak, I long to die,
==67== If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.

**FRI. L.**
==68== Hold, daughter! I do spy a kind of hope,
==69== Which craves as desperate an execution
==70== As that is desperate which we would prevent.
==71== If rather than to marry County Paris,
==72== Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
==73== Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
==74== A thing like death to chide away this shame,
==75== That cop’st with Death himself to scape from it;
==76== And if thou darest, I’ll give thee remedy.

**JUL.**
==77== O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
==78== From off the battlements of any tower,
==79== Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
==80== Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
==81== Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
==82== O’ercover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
==83== With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
==84== Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
==85== And hide me with a dead man in his shroud⁠—
==86== Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble⁠—
==87== And I will do it without fear or doubt,
==88== To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.

**FRI. L.**
==89== Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent
==90== To marry Paris. We’n’sday is tomorrow;
==91== Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
==92== Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
==93== Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
==94== And this distilling liquor drink thou off,
==95== When presently through all thy veins shall run
==96== A cold and drowsy humor; for no pulse
==97== Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
==98== No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest;
==99== The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
==100== To wanny ashes, thy eyes’ windows fall,
==101== Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
==102== Each part, depriv’d of supple government,
==103== Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,
==104== And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
==105== Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
==106== And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
==107== Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
==108== To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
==109== Then, as the manner of our country is,
==110== In thy best robes, uncovered on the bier,
==111== Thou shall be borne to that same ancient vault
==112== Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
==113== In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
==114== Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
==115== And hither shall he come, an’ he and I
==116== Will watch thy waking, and that very night
==117== Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
==118== And this shall free thee from this present shame,
==119== If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
==120== Abate thy valor in the acting it.

**JUL.**
==121== Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

**FRI. L.**
==122== Hold, get you gone. Be strong and prosperous
==123== In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed
==124== To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

**JUL.**
==125== Love give me strength! And strength shall help afford.
==126== Farewell, dear father!

*Exeunt.*
