## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Friar Lawrence’s cell.*

*Enter Friar John.*

**FRI. J.**
==1==Holy Franciscan friar! Brother, ho!

*Enter Friar Lawrence.*

**FRI. L.**
==2==This same should be the voice of Friar John.
==3==Welcome from Mantua! What says Romeo?
==4==Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

**FRI. J.**
==5==Going to find a barefoot brother out,
==6==One of our order, to associate me,
==7==Here in this city visiting the sick,
==8==And finding him, the searchers of the town,
==9==Suspecting that we both were in a house
==10==Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
==11==Seal’d up the doors and would not let us forth,
==12==So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.

**FRI. L.**
==13==Who bare my letter then to Romeo?

**FRI. J.**
==14==I could not send it—here it is again⁠—
==15==Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
==16==So fearful were they of infection.

**FRI. L.**
==17==Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
==18==The letter was not nice but full of charge,
==19==Of dear import, and the neglecting it
==20==May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
==21==Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
==22==Unto my cell.

**FRI. J.**
==23==Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.

*Exit.*

**FRI. L.**
==24==Now must I to the monument alone,
==25==Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
==26==She will beshrew me much that Romeo
==27==Hath had no notice of these accidents;
==28==But I will write again to Mantua,
==29==And keep her at my cell till Romeo come⁠—
==30==Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb!

*Exit.*
