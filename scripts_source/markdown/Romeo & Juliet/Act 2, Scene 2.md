## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Capulet’s orchard.*

*Romeo advances.*

**ROM.**
==1== He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
*(Enter Juliet above at her window.)*
==2== But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
==3== It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
==4== Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
==5== Who is already sick and pale with grief
==6== That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.
==7== Be not her maid, since she is envious;
==8== Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
==9== And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
==10== It is my lady, O, it is my love!
==11== O that she knew she were!
==12== She speaks, yet she says nothing; what of that?
==13== Her eye discourses, I will answer it.
==14== I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
==15== Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
==16== Having some business, do entreat her eyes
==17== To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
==18== What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
==19== The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
==20== As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
==21== Would through the airy region stream so bright
==22== That birds would sing and think it were not night.
==23== See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
==24== O that I were a glove upon that hand,
==25== That I might touch that cheek!

**JUL.**
==25==                 Ay me!

**ROM.**
==25==                      She speaks!
==26== O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art
==27== As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
==28== As is a winged messenger of heaven
==29== Unto the white-upturned wond’ring eyes
==30== Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him,
==31== When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds,
==32== And sails upon the bosom of the air.

**JUL.**
==33== O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
==34== Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
==35== Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
==36== And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.

**ROM.**
*(Aside.)*
==37== Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

**JUL.**
==38== ’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
==39== Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
==40== What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,
==41== Nor arm nor face, nor any other part
==42== Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
==43== What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
==44== By any other word would smell as sweet;
==45== So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
==46== Retain that dear perfection which he owes
==47== Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
==48== And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
==49== Take all myself.

**ROM.**
==49==         I take thee at thy word.
==50== Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptiz’d;
==51== Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

**JUL.**
==52== What man art thou that thus bescreen’d in night
==53== So stumblest on my counsel?

**ROM.**
==53==                 By a name
==54== I know not how to tell thee who I am.
==55== My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
==56== Because it is an enemy to thee;
==57== Had I it written, I would tear the word.

**JUL.**
==58== My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
==59== Of thy tongue’s uttering, yet I know the sound.
==60== Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

**ROM.**
==61== Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

**JUL.**
==62== How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
==63== The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
==64== And the place death, considering who thou art,
==65== If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

**ROM.**
==66== With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,
==67== For stony limits cannot hold love out,
==68== And what love can do, that dares love attempt;
==69== Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

**JUL.**
==70== If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

**ROM.**
==71== Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
==72== Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
==73== And I am proof against their enmity.

**JUL.**
==74== I would not for the world they saw thee here.

**ROM.**
==75== I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,
==76== And but thou love me, let them find me here;
==77== My life were better ended by their hate,
==78== Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

**JUL.**
==79== By whose direction foundst thou out this place?

**ROM.**
==80== By love, that first did prompt me to inquire;
==81== He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
==82== I am no pilot, yet, wert thou as far
==83== As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
==84== I should adventure for such merchandise.

**JUL.**
==85== Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
==86== Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
==87== For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
==88== Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
==89== What I have spoke, but farewell compliment!
==90== Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say, “Ay,”
==91== And I will take thy word; yet, if thou swear’st,
==92== Thou mayest prove false: at lovers’ perjuries
==93== They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
==94== If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully;
==95== Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
==96== I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
==97== So thou wilt woo, but else not for the world.
==98== In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
==99== And therefore thou mayest think my behavior light,
==100== But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true
==101== Than those that have more coying to be strange.
==102== I should have been more strange, I must confess,
==103== But that thou overheardst, ere I was ware,
==104== My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
==105== And not impute this yielding to light love,
==106== Which the dark night hath so discovered.

**ROM.**
==107== Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
==108== That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops⁠—

**JUL.**
==109== O, swear not by the moon, th’ inconstant moon,
==110== That monthly changes in her circled orb,
==111== Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

**ROM.**
==112== What shall I swear by?

**JUL.**
==112==            Do not swear at all;
==113== Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
==114== Which is the god of my idolatry,
==115== And I’ll believe thee.

**ROM.**
==115==            If my heart’s dear love⁠—

**JUL.**
==116== Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
==117== I have no joy of this contract tonight,
==118== It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
==119== Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
==120== Ere one can say it lightens. Sweet, good night!
==121== This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,
==122== May prove a beauteous flow’r when next we meet.
==123== Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
==124== Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

**ROM.**
==125== O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

**JUL.**
==126== What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

**ROM.**
==127== Th’ exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.

**JUL.**
==128== I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
==129== And yet I would it were to give again.

**ROM.**
==130== Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

**JUL.**
==131== But to be frank and give it thee again,
==132== And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
==133== My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
==134== My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
==135== The more I have, for both are infinite.
*(Nurse calls within.)*
==136== I hear some noise within; dear love, *adieu*!
==137== Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
==138== Stay but a little, I will come again.

*Exit above.*

**ROM.**
==139== O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
==140== Being in night, all this is but a dream,
==141== Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

*Enter Juliet above.*

**JUL.**
==142== Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
==143== If that thy bent of love be honorable,
==144== Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
==145== By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
==146== Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
==147== And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay,
==148== And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

**NURSE.**
*(Within.)*
==149== Madam!

**JUL.**
==150== I come, anon.—But if thou meanest not well,
==151== I do beseech thee⁠—

**NURSE.**
*(Within.)*
==151==            Madam!

**JUL.**
==151==               By and by, I come⁠—
==152== To cease thy strife, and leave me to my grief.
==153== Tomorrow will I send.

**ROM.**
==153==               So thrive my soul⁠—

**JUL.**
==154== A thousand times good night!

*Exit above.*

**ROM.**
==155== A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
==156== Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
==157== But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

*Retiring.*

*Enter Juliet again above.*

**JUL.**
==158== Hist, Romeo, hist! O, for a falc’ner’s voice,
==159== To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
==160== Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud,
==161== Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
==162== And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
==163== With repetition of my Romeo’s name. Romeo!

**ROM.**
==164== It is my soul that calls upon my name.
==165== How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
==166== Like softest music to attending ears!

**JUL.**
==167== Romeo!

**ROM.**
==167==         My nyas?

**JUL.**
==167==               What a’ clock tomorrow
==168== Shall I send to thee?

**ROM.**
==168==            By the hour of nine.

**JUL.**
==169== I will not fail, ’tis twenty year till then.
==170== I have forgot why I did call thee back.

**ROM.**
==171== Let me stand here till thou remember it.

**JUL.**
==172== I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
==173== Rememb’ring how I love thy company.

**ROM.**
==174== And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
==175== Forgetting any other home but this.

**JUL.**
==176== ’Tis almost morning, I would have thee gone⁠—
==177== And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
==178== That lets it hop a little from his hand,
==179== Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
==180== And with a silken thread plucks it back again,
==181== So loving-jealous of his liberty.

**ROM.**
==182== I would I were thy bird.

**JUL.**
==182==               Sweet, so would I,
==183== Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
==184== Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
==185== That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
==186== Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!

*Exit above.*

**ROM.**
==187== Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
==188== Hence will I to my ghostly sire’s close cell,
==189== His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

*Exit.*
