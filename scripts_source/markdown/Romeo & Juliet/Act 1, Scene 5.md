## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Prologue|Act 2, Prologue →]]

*Verona. A hall in Capulet’s house.*

*Servingmen come forth with napkins.*

**1. SERV.**
==1==Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He shift a trencher? He scrape a trencher?

**2. SERV.**
==2==When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.

**1. SERV.**
==3==Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert, look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
*(Exit Second Servant.)*
==4==Anthony and Potpan!

*Enter Anthony and Potpan.*

**ANT.**
==5==Ay, boy, ready.

**1. SERV.**
==6==You are look’d for and call’d for, ask’d for and sought for, in the great chamber.

**POT.**
==7==We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys, be brisk a while, and the longer liver take all.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Old Capulet, Juliet, Tybalt, Nurse, Servingmen, and all the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.*

**CAP.**
==8==Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
==9==Unplagu’d with corns will walk a bout with you.
==10==Ah, my mistresses, which of you all
==11==Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
==12==She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
==13==Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
==14==That I have worn a visor and could tell
==15==A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
==16==Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone.
==17==You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
*(Music plays, and they dance.)*
==18==A hall, a hall! Give room! And foot it, girls.
==19==More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up;
==20==And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
==21==Ah, sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.
==22==Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
==23==For you and I are past our dancing days.
==24==How long is’t now since last yourself and I
==25==Were in a mask?

**OLD. CAP.**
==25==        By’r lady, thirty years.

**CAP.**
==26==What, man? ’Tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
==27==’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
==28==Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
==29==Some five and twenty years, and then we mask’d.

**OLD. CAP.**
==30==’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir;
==31==His son is thirty.

**CAP.**
==31==        Will you tell me that?
==32==His son was but a ward two years ago.

**ROM.**
*(To Third Servingman.)*
==33==What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand
==34==Of yonder knight?

**3. SERV.**
==35==I know not, sir.

**ROM.**
==36==O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
==37==It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
==38==As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear⁠—
==39==Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
==40==So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
==41==As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
==42==The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,
==43==And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
==44==Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
==45==For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.

**TYB.**
==46==This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
==47==Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
==48==Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
==49==To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
==50==Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,
==51==To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.

**CAP.**
==52==Why, how now, kinsman, wherefore storm you so?

**TYB.**
==53==Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
==54==A villain that is hither come in spite
==55==To scorn at our solemnity this night.

**CAP.**
==56==Young Romeo is it?

**TYB.**
==56==           ’Tis he, that villain Romeo.

**CAP.**
==57==Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
==58==’A bears him like a portly gentleman;
==59==And to say truth, Verona brags of him
==60==To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.
==61==I would not for the wealth of all this town
==62==Here in my house do him disparagement;
==63==Therefore be patient, take no note of him;
==64==It is my will, the which if thou respect,
==65==Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
==66==An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

**TYB.**
==67==It fits when such a villain is a guest.
==68==I’ll not endure him.

**CAP.**
==68==           He shall be endured.
==69==What, goodman boy? I say he shall, go to!
==70==Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
==71==You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
==72==You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
==73==You will set cock-a-hoop! You’ll be the man!

**TYB.**
==74==Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.

**CAP.**
==74==              Go to, go to,
==75==You are a saucy boy. Is’t so indeed?
==76==This trick may chance to scath you, I know what.
==77==You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.⁠—
==78==Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox, go,
==79==Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame,
==80==I’ll make you quiet, what!—Cheerly, my hearts!

**TYB.**
==81==Patience perforce with willful choler meeting
==82==Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
==83==I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,
==84==Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt’rest gall.

*Exit.*

**ROM.**
*(To Juliet.)*
==85==If I profane with my unworthiest hand
==86==This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
==87==My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
==88==To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

**JUL.**
==89==Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
==90==Which mannerly devotion shows in this:
==91==For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
==92==And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.

**ROM.**
==93==Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

**JUL.**
==94==Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray’r.

**ROM.**
==95==O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do,
==96==They pray—grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

**JUL.**
==97==Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.

**ROM.**
==98==Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.
==99==Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg’d.

*Kissing her.*

**JUL.**
==100==Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

**ROM.**
==101==Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!
==102==Give me my sin again.

*Kissing her again.*

**JUL.**
==102==           You kiss by th’ book.

**NURSE.**
==103==Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

**ROM.**
==104==What is her mother?

**NURSE.**
==104==           Marry, bachelor,
==105==Her mother is the lady of the house,
==106==And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
==107==I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal;
==108==I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
==109==Shall have the chinks.

**ROM.**
==109==           Is she a Capulet?
==110==O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.

**BEN.**
==111==Away, be gone, the sport is at the best.

**ROM.**
==112==Ay, so I fear, the more is my unrest.

**CAP.**
==113==Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
==114==We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
*(They whisper in his ear.)*
==115==Is it e’en so? Why then I thank you all.
==116==I thank you, honest gentlemen, good night.
==117==More torches here! Come on, then let’s to bed.
*(To Second Capulet.)*
==118==Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
==119==I’ll to my rest.

*Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse.*

**JUL.**
==120==Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

**NURSE.**
==121==The son and heir of old Tiberio.

**JUL.**
==122==What’s he that now is going out of door?

**NURSE.**
==123==Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.

**JUL.**
==124==What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?

**NURSE.**
==125==I know not.

**JUL.**
==126==Go ask his name.—If he be married,
==127==My grave is like to be my wedding-bed.

**NURSE.**
==128==His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
==129==The only son of your great enemy.

**JUL.**
==130==My only love sprung from my only hate!
==131==Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
==132==Prodigious birth of love it is to me
==133==That I must love a loathed enemy.

**NURSE.**
==134==What’s tis? What’s tis?

**JUL.**
==134==           A rhyme I learnt even now
==135==Of one I danc’d withal.

*One calls within, “Juliet!”*

**NURSE.**
==135==              Anon, anon!
==136==Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.

*Exeunt.*
