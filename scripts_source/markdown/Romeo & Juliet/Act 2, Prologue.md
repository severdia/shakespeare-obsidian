## Act 2, Prologue
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Chorus.*

**CHORUS.**
==1==Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
==2==And young affection gapes to be his heir;
==3==That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
==4==With tender Juliet match’d is now not fair.
==5==Now Romeo is belov’d and loves again,
==6==Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
==7==But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
==8==And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks.
==9==Being held a foe, he may not have access
==10==To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
==11==And she as much in love, her means much less
==12==To meet her new-beloved any where.
==13==But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
==14==Temp’ring extremities with extreme sweet.


*Exit.*
