## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Capulet’s orchard.*

*Enter Juliet.*

**JUL.**
==1==The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
==2==In half an hour she promised to return.
==3==Perchance she cannot meet him—that’s not so.
==4==O, she is lame! Love’s heralds should be thoughts,
==5==Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,
==6==Driving back shadows over low’ring hills;
==7==Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw Love,
==8==And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
==9==Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
==10==Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve
==11==Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
==12==Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
==13==She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
==14==My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
==15==And his to me.
==16==But old folks—many feign as they were dead,
==17==Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.
*(Enter Nurse and Peter.)*
==18==O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
==19==Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

**NURSE.**
==20==Peter, stay at the gate.

*Exit Peter.*

**JUL.**
==21==Now, good sweet nurse—O Lord, why lookest thou sad?
==22==Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
==23==If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
==24==By playing it to me with so sour a face.

**NURSE.**
==25==I am a-weary, give me leave a while.
==26==Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I!

**JUL.**
==27==I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
==28==Nay, come, I pray thee speak, good, good nurse, speak.

**NURSE.**
==29==Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay a while?
==30==Do you not see that I am out of breath?

**JUL.**
==31==How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
==32==To say to me that thou art out of breath?
==33==The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
==34==Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
==35==Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
==36==Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
==37==Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?

**NURSE.**
==38==Well, you have made a simple choice, you know not how to choose a man. Romeo! No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talk’d on, yet they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve God. What, have you din’d at home?

**JUL.**
==39==No, no! But all this did I know before.
==40==What says he of our marriage? What of that?

**NURSE.**
==41==Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
==42==It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
==43==My back a’ t’ other side—ah, my back, my back!
==44==Beshrew your heart for sending me about
==45==To catch my death with jauncing up and down!

**JUL.**
==46==I’ faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
==47==Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

**NURSE.**
==48==Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
==49==An’ a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
==50==And, I warrant, a virtuous—Where is your mother?

**JUL.**
==51==Where is my mother! Why, she is within,
==52==Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
==53==“Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
==54==‘Where is your mother?’”

**NURSE.**
==54==              O God’s lady dear!
==55==Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow;
==56==Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
==57==Henceforward do your messages yourself.

**JUL.**
==58==Here’s such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?

**NURSE.**
==59==Have you got leave to go to shrift today?

**JUL.**
==60==I have.

**NURSE.**
==61==Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell,
==62==There stays a husband to make you a wife.
==63==Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
==64==They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
==65==Hie you to church, I must another way,
==66==To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
==67==Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
==68==I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
==69==But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
==70==Go, I’ll to dinner, hie you to the cell.

**JUL.**
==71==Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

*Exeunt.*
