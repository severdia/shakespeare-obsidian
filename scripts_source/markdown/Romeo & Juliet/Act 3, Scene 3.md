## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Friar Lawrence’s cell.*

*Enter Friar Lawrence.*

**FRI. L.**
==1==Romeo, come forth, come forth, thou fearful man:
==2==Affliction is enamor’d of thy parts,
==3==And thou art wedded to calamity.

*Enter Romeo.*

**ROM.**
==4==Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
==5==What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
==6==That I yet know not?

**FRI. L.**
==6==           Too familiar
==7==Is my dear son with such sour company!
==8==I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.

**ROM.**
==9==What less than dooms-day is the Prince’s doom?

**FRI. L.**
==10==A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips⁠—
==11==Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.

**ROM.**
==12==Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say “death”;
==13==For exile hath more terror in his look,
==14==Much more than death. Do not say “banishment”!

**FRI. L.**
==15==Here from Verona art thou banished.
==16==Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

**ROM.**
==17==There is no world without Verona walls,
==18==But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
==19==Hence “banished” is banish’d from the world,
==20==And world’s exile is death; then “banished”
==21==Is death misterm’d. Calling death “banished,”
==22==Thou cut’st my head off with a golden axe,
==23==And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

**FRI. L.**
==24==O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
==25==Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,
==26==Taking thy part, hath rush’d aside the law,
==27==And turn’d that black word ’death’ to “banishment.”
==28==This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

**ROM.**
==29==’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here
==30==Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog
==31==And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
==32==Live here in heaven and may look on her,
==33==But Romeo may not. More validity,
==34==More honorable state, more courtship lives
==35==In carrion flies than Romeo; they may seize
==36==On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,
==37==And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
==38==Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
==39==Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
==40==But Romeo may not, he is banished.
==41==Flies may do this, but I from this must fly;
==42==They are free men, but I am banished:
==43==And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
==44==Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
==45==No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
==46==But “banished” to kill me? “Banished”?
==47==O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
==48==Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
==49==Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
==50==A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
==51==To mangle me with that word “banished”?

**FRI. L.**
==52==Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.

**ROM.**
==53==O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

**FRI. L.**
==54==I’ll give thee armor to keep off that word:
==55==Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
==56==To comfort thee though thou art banished.

**ROM.**
==57==Yet “banished”? Hang up philosophy!
==58==Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
==59==Displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,
==60==It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.

**FRI. L.**
==61==O then I see that madmen have no ears.

**ROM.**
==62==How should they when that wise men have no eyes?

**FRI. L.**
==63==Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

**ROM.**
==64==Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
==65==Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
==66==An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
==67==Doting like me, and like me banished,
==68==Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
==69==And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
==70==Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

*Enter Nurse within and knock.*

**FRI. L.**
==71==Arise, one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.

**ROM.**
==72==Not I, unless the breath of heart-sick groans
==73==Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.

*Knock.*

**FRI. L.**
==74==Hark how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,
==75==Thou wilt be taken.—Stay a while!—Stand up;
*(Loud knock.)*
==76==Run to my study.—By and by!—God’s will,
==77==What simpleness is this?—I come, I come!
*(Knock.)*
==78==Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What’s your will?

**NURSE.**
*(Within.)*
==79==Let me come in, and you shall know my errant.
==80==I come from Lady Juliet.

**FRI. L.**
==80==              Welcome then.

*Unlocks the door.*

*Enter Nurse.*

**NURSE.**
==81==O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
==82==Where’s my lady’s lord? Where’s Romeo?

**FRI. L.**
==83==There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

**NURSE.**
==84==O, he is even in my mistress’ case,
==85==Just in her case. O woeful sympathy!
==86==Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
==87==Blubb’ring and weeping, weeping and blubb’ring.
==88==Stand up, stand up, stand, and you be a man.
==89==For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
==90==Why should you fall into so deep an O?

**ROM.**
==91==Nurse!

*He rises.*

**NURSE.**
==92==Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.

**ROM.**
==93==Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
==94==Doth not she think me an old murderer,
==95==Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
==96==With blood removed but little from her own?
==97==Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
==98==My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?

**NURSE.**
==99==O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,
==100==And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
==101==And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
==102==And then down falls again.

**ROM.**
==102==              As if that name,
==103==Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
==104==Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
==105==Murder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
==106==In what vile part of this anatomy
==107==Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
==108==The hateful mansion.

*He offers to stab himself, and Nurse snatches the dagger away.*

**FRI. L.**
==108==           Hold thy desperate hand!
==109==Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
==110==Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
==111==The unreasonable fury of a beast.
==112==Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
==113==And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both,
==114==Thou hast amaz’d me! By my holy order,
==115==I thought thy disposition better temper’d.
==116==Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself,
==117==And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
==118==By doing damned hate upon thyself?
==119==Why railest thou on thy birth? The heaven and earth?
==120==Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
==121==In thee at once, which thou at once wouldst lose.
==122==Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
==123==Which like a usurer abound’st in all,
==124==And usest none in that true use indeed
==125==Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
==126==Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
==127==Digressing from the valor of a man;
==128==Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
==129==Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
==130==Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
==131==Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
==132==Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
==133==Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
==134==And thou dismemb’red with thine own defense.
==135==What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
==136==For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead:
==137==There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
==138==But thou slewest Tybalt: there art thou happy.
==139==The law that threat’ned death becomes thy friend,
==140==And turns it to exile: there art thou happy.
==141==A pack of blessings light upon thy back,
==142==Happiness courts thee in her best array,
==143==But like a mishaved and sullen wench,
==144==Thou pouts upon thy fortune and thy love.
==145==Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
==146==Go get thee to thy love as was decreed,
==147==Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
==148==But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
==149==For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
==150==Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
==151==To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
==152==Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
==153==With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
==154==Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
==155==Go before, nurse; commend me to thy lady,
==156==And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
==157==Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
==158==Romeo is coming.

**NURSE.**
==159==O Lord, I could have sta’d here all the night
==160==To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
==161==My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.

**ROM.**
==162==Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

*Nurse offers to go in, and turns again.*

**NURSE.**
==163==Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
==164==Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

**ROM.**
==165==How well my comfort is reviv’d by this!

*Exit Nurse.*

**FRI. L.**
==166==Go hence, good night; and here stands all your state:
==167==Either be gone before the watch be set,
==168==Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
==169==Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,
==170==And he shall signify from time to time
==171==Every good hap to you that chances here.
==172==Give me thy hand. ’Tis late; farewell, good night.

**ROM.**
==173==But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
==174==It were a grief, so brief to part with thee.
==175==Farewell.

*Exeunt.*
