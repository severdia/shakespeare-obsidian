## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*A room in Capulet’s house.*

*Enter old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.*

**CAP.**
==1==Things have fall’n out, sir, so unluckily
==2==That we have had no time to move our daughter.
==3==Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
==4==And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
==5==’Tis very late, she’ll not come down tonight.
==6==I promise you, but for your company,
==7==I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

**PAR.**
==8==These times of woe afford no times to woo.
==9==Madam, good night, commend me to your daughter.

**L. CAP.**
==10==I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
==11==Tonight she’s mewed up to her heaviness.

*Paris offers to go in, and Capulet calls him again.*

**CAP.**
==12==Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
==13==Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
==14==In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
==15==Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
==16==Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
==17==And bid her—mark you me?—on We’n’sday next⁠—
==18==But soft, what day is this?

**PAR.**
==18==              Monday, my lord.

**CAP.**
==19==Monday! Ha, ha! Well, We’n’sday is too soon,
==20==A’ Thursday let it be—a’ Thursday, tell her,
==21==She shall be married to this noble earl.
==22==Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
==23==We’ll keep no great ado—a friend or two,
==24==For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
==25==It may be thought we held him carelessly,
==26==Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
==27==Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
==28==And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

**PAR.**
==29==My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.

**CAP.**
==30==Well, get you gone, a’ Thursday be it then.⁠—
==31==Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
==32==Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
==33==Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber ho!
==34==Afore me, it is so very late that we
==35==May call it early by and by. Good night.

*Exeunt.*
