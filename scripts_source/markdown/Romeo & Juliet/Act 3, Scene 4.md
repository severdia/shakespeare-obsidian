## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*A room in Capulet’s house.*

*Enter old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.*

**CAP.**
Things have fall’n out, sir, so unluckily
That we have had no time to move our daughter.
Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
’Tis very late, she’ll not come down tonight.
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

**PAR.**
These times of woe afford no times to woo.
Madam, good night, commend me to your daughter.

**L. CAP.**
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
Tonight she’s mewed up to her heaviness.

*Paris offers to go in, and Capulet calls him again.*

**CAP.**
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
And bid her—mark you me?—on We’n’sday next⁠—
But soft, what day is this?

**PAR.**
              Monday, my lord.

**CAP.**
Monday! Ha, ha! Well, We’n’sday is too soon,
A’ Thursday let it be—a’ Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
We’ll keep no great ado—a friend or two,
For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

**PAR.**
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.

**CAP.**
Well, get you gone, a’ Thursday be it then.⁠—
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber ho!
Afore me, it is so very late that we
May call it early by and by. Good night.

*Exeunt.*
