## Act 1, Prologue
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 1|Act 1, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Chorus.*

**CHORUS.**
==1==Two households, both alike in dignity,
==2==In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
==3==From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
==4==Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
==5==From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
==6==A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
==7==Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
==8==Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
==9==The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
==10==And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
==11==Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
==12==Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
==13==The which if you with patient ears attend,
==14==What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.


*Exit.*
