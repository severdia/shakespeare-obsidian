## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Capulet’s orchard and Juliet’s chamber.*

*Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft at the window.*

**JUL.**
==1==Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
==2==It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
==3==That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
==4==Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
==5==Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

**ROM.**
==6==It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
==7==No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
==8==Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
==9==Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
==10==Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
==11==I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

**JUL.**
==12==Yond light is not day-light, I know it, I;
==13==It is some meteor that the sun exhal’d
==14==To be to thee this night a torch-bearer
==15==And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
==16==Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.

**ROM.**
==17==Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,
==18==I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
==19==I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
==20==’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow;
==21==Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
==22==The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
==23==I have more care to stay than will to go.
==24==Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
==25==How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk, it is not day.

**JUL.**
==26==It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
==27==It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
==28==Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
==29==Some say the lark makes sweet division;
==30==This doth not so, for she divideth us.
==31==Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
==32==O now I would they had chang’d voices too,
==33==Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
==34==Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
==35==O now be gone, more light and light it grows.

**ROM.**
==36==More light and light, more dark and dark our woes!

*Enter Nurse hastily.*

**NURSE.**
==37==Madam!

**JUL.**
==38==Nurse?

**NURSE.**
==39==Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
==40==The day is broke, be wary, look about.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==41==Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

**ROM.**
==42==Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I’ll descend.

*He goeth down.*

**JUL.**
==43==Art thou gone so, love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
==44==I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
==45==For in a minute there are many days.
==46==O, by this count I shall be much in years
==47==Ere I again behold my Romeo!

**ROM.**
*(From below.)*
==47==                     Farewell!
==48==I will omit no opportunity
==49==That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

**JUL.**
==50==O, think’st thou we shall ever meet again?

**ROM.**
==51==I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve
==52==For sweet discourses in our times to come.

**JUL.**
==53==O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
==54==Methinks I see thee now, thou art so low,
==55==As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
==56==Either my eyesight fails, or thou lookest pale.

**ROM.**
==57==And trust me, love, in my eye so do you;
==58==Dry sorrow drinks our blood. *Adieu*, *adieu*!

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==59==O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle;
==60==If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
==61==That is renowm’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune:
==62==For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long,
==63==But send him back.

**L. CAP.**
*(Within.)*
==63==           Ho, daughter, are you up?

**JUL.**
==64==Who is’t that calls? It is my lady mother.
==65==Is she not down so late, or up so early?
==66==What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?

*She goeth down from the window.*

*Enter Mother, Lady Capulet.*

**L. CAP.**
==67==Why, how now, Juliet?

**JUL.**
==67==              Madam, I am not well.

**L. CAP.**
==68==Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
==69==What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
==70==And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
==71==Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love,
==72==But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

**JUL.**
==73==Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

**L. CAP.**
==74==So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
==75==Which you weep for.

**JUL.**
==75==           Feeling so the loss,
==76==I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

**L. CAP.**
==77==Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death,
==78==As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.

**JUL.**
==79==What villain, madam?

**L. CAP.**
==79==           That same villain Romeo.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==80==Villain and he be many miles asunder.⁠—
==81==God pardon him! I do with all my heart;
==82==And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

**L. CAP.**
==83==That is because the traitor murderer lives.

**JUL.**
==84==Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
==85==Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death!

**L. CAP.**
==86==We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
==87==Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,
==88==Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,
==89==Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
==90==That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
==91==And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.

**JUL.**
==92==Indeed I never shall be satisfied
==93==With Romeo, till I behold him—dead⁠—
==94==Is my poor heart, so for a kinsman vex’d.
==95==Madam, if you could find out but a man
==96==To bear a poison, I would temper it,
==97==That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
==98==Soon sleep in quiet. O how my heart abhors
==99==To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him
==100==To wreak the love I bore my cousin
==101==Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him!

**L. CAP.**
==102==Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
==103==But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

**JUL.**
==104==And joy comes well in such a needy time.
==105==What are they, beseech your ladyship?

**L. CAP.**
==106==Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child,
==107==One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
==108==Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
==109==That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.

**JUL.**
==110==Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

**L. CAP.**
==111==Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
==112==The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
==113==The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,
==114==Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

**JUL.**
==115==Now, by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too,
==116==He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
==117==I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
==118==Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
==119==I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
==120==I will not marry yet, and when I do, I swear
==121==It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
==122==Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

**L. CAP.**
==123==Here comes your father, tell him so yourself;
==124==And see how he will take it at your hands.

*Enter Capulet and Nurse.*

**CAP.**
==125==When the sun sets, the earth doth drizzle dew,
==126==But for the sunset of my brother’s son
==127==It rains downright.
==128==How now, a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
==129==Evermore show’ring? In one little body
==130==Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind:
==131==For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
==132==Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
==133==Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
==134==Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
==135==Without a sudden calm, will overset
==136==Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
==137==Have you delivered to her our decree?

**L. CAP.**
==138==Ay, sir, but she will none, she gives you thanks.
==139==I would the fool were married to her grave!

**CAP.**
==140==Soft, take me with you, take me with you, wife.
==141==How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
==142==Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
==143==Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
==144==So worthy a gentleman to be her bride?

**JUL.**
==145==Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
==146==Proud can I never be of what I hate,
==147==But thankful even for hate that is meant love.

**CAP.**
==148==How how, how how, chopp’d logic! What is this?
==149==“Proud,” and “I thank you,” and “I thank you not,”
==150==And yet “not proud,” mistress minion you?
==151==Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
==152==But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next,
==153==To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
==154==Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
==155==Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
==156==You tallow-face!

**L. CAP.**
==156==           Fie, fie, what, are you mad?

**JUL.**
==157==Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
==158==Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

*She kneels down.*

**CAP.**
==159==Hang thee, young baggage! Disobedient wretch!
==160==I tell thee what: get thee to church a’ Thursday,
==161==Or never after look me in the face.
==162==Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
==163==My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
==164==That God had lent us but this only child,
==165==But now I see this one is one too much,
==166==And that we have a curse in having her.
==167==Out on her, hilding!

**NURSE.**
==167==           God in heaven bless her!
==168==You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

**CAP.**
==169==And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
==170==Good Prudence, smatter with your gossips, go.

**NURSE.**
==171==I speak no treason.

**CAP.**
==171==           O, God-i-goden!

**NURSE.**
==172==May not one speak?

**CAP.**
==173==Peace, you mumbling fool!
==174==Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,
==175==For here we need it not.

**L. CAP.**
==175==              You are too hot.

**CAP.**
==176==God’s bread, it makes me mad! Day, night, work, play,
==177==Alone, in company, still my care hath been
==178==To have her match’d; and having now provided
==179==A gentleman of noble parentage,
==180==Of fair demesnes, youthful and nobly lien’d,
==181==Stuff’d, as they say, with honorable parts,
==182==Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,
==183==And then to have a wretched puling fool,
==184==A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
==185==To answer, “I’ll not wed, I cannot love;
==186==I am too young, I pray you pardon me.”
==187==But and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.
==188==Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
==189==Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.
==190==Thursday is near, lay hand on heart, advise.
==191==And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;
==192==And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
==193==For, by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
==194==Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
==195==Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==196==Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
==197==That sees into the bottom of my grief?
==198==O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
==199==Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
==200==Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
==201==In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

**L. CAP.**
==202==Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
==203==Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==204==O God!—O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
==205==My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
==206==How shall that faith return again to earth,
==207==Unless that husband send it me from heaven
==208==By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me!
==209==Alack, alack, that heaven should practice stratagems
==210==Upon so soft a subject as myself!
==211==What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
==212==Some comfort, nurse.

**NURSE.**
==212==              Faith, here it is.
==213==Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing
==214==That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you;
==215==Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
==216==Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
==217==I think it best you married with the County.
==218==O he’s a lovely gentleman!
==219==Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
==220==Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
==221==As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
==222==I think you are happy in this second match,
==223==For it excels your first; or if it did not,
==224==Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were
==225==As living here and you no use of him.

**JUL.**
==226==Speak’st thou from thy heart?

**NURSE.**
==227==And from my soul too, else beshrew them both.

**JUL.**
==228==Amen!

**NURSE.**
==229==What?

**JUL.**
==230==Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.
==231==Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
==232==Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,
==233==To make confession and to be absolv’d.

**NURSE.**
==234==Marry, I will, and this is wisely done.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
*(She looks after Nurse.)*
==235==Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
==236==Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
==237==Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
==238==Which she hath prais’d him with above compare
==239==So many thousand times? Go, counsellor,
==240==Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
==241==I’ll to the friar to know his remedy;
==242==If all else fail, myself have power to die.

*Exit.*
