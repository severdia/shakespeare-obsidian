## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Juliet’s chamber.*

*Enter Juliet and Nurse.*

**JUL.**
==1==Ay, those attires are best, but, gentle nurse,
==2==I pray thee leave me to myself tonight,
==3==For I have need of many orisons
==4==To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
==5==Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.

*Enter Mother, Lady Capulet.*

**L. CAP.**
==6==What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?

**JUL.**
==7==No, madam, we have cull’d such necessaries
==8==As are behoofeful for our state tomorrow.
==9==So please you, let me now be left alone,
==10==And let the nurse this night sit up with you,
==11==For I am sure you have your hands full all,
==12==In this so sudden business.

**L. CAP.**
==12==              Good night.
==13==Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.

*Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse.*

**JUL.**
==14==Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
==15==I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
==16==That almost freezes up the heat of life.
==17==I’ll call them back again to comfort me.
==18==Nurse!—What should she do here?
==19==My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
==20==Come, vial.
==21==What if this mixture do not work at all?
==22==Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
==23==No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
*(Laying down her dagger.)*
==24==What if it be a poison which the friar
==25==Subtly hath minist’red to have me dead,
==26==Lest in this marriage he should be dishonor’d
==27==Because he married me before to Romeo?
==28==I fear it is, and yet methinks it should not,
==29==For he hath still been tried a holy man.
==30==How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
==31==I wake before the time that Romeo
==32==Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!
==33==Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
==34==To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
==35==And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
==36==Or if I live, is it not very like
==37==The horrible conceit of death and night,
==38==Together with the terror of the place⁠—
==39==As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
==40==Where for this many hundred years the bones
==41==Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
==42==Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
==43==Lies fest’ring in his shroud, where, as they say,
==44==At some hours in the night spirits resort⁠—
==45==Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
==46==So early waking—what with loathsome smells,
==47==And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
==48==That living mortals, hearing them, run mad⁠—
==49==O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
==50==Environed with all these hideous fears,
==51==And madly play with my forefathers’ joints,
==52==And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,
==53==And in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
==54==As with a club, dash out my desp’rate brains?
==55==O, look! Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost
==56==Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
==57==Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
==58==Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here’s drink—I drink to thee.

*She falls upon her bed, within the curtains.*
