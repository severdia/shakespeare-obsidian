## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Friar Lawrence’s cell.*

*Enter Friar Lawrence alone, with a basket.*

**FRI. L.**
==1==The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
==2==Check’ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light,
==3==And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
==4==From forth day’s path and Titan’s fiery wheels.
==5==Now ere the sun advance his burning eye,
==6==The day to cheer and night’s dank dew to dry,
==7==I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
==8==With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
==9==The earth that’s nature’s mother is her tomb;
==10==What is her burying grave, that is her womb;
==11==And from her womb children of diverse kind
==12==We sucking on her natural bosom find:
==13==Many for many virtues excellent,
==14==None but for some, and yet all different.
==15==O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
==16==In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
==17==For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
==18==But to the earth some special good doth give;
==19==Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,
==20==Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
==21==Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
==22==And vice sometime by action dignified.
*(Enter Romeo.)*
==23==Within the infant rind of this weak flower
==24==Poison hath residence and medicine power;
==25==For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part,
==26==Being tasted, stays all senses with the heart.
==27==Two such opposed kings encamp them still
==28==In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
==29==And where the worser is predominant,
==30==Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

**ROM.**
==31==Good morrow, father.

**FRI. L.**
==31==              *Benedicite!*
==32==What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
==33==Young son, it argues a distempered head
==34==So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
==35==Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
==36==And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
==37==But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
==38==Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
==39==Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
==40==Thou art up-rous’d with some distemp’rature;
==41==Or if not so, then here I hit it right⁠—
==42==Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.

**ROM.**
==43==That last is true—the sweeter rest was mine.

**FRI. L.**
==44==God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

**ROM.**
==45==With Rosaline? My ghostly father, no;
==46==I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.

**FRI. L.**
==47==That’s my good son, but where hast thou been then?

**ROM.**
==48==I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
==49==I have been feasting with mine enemy,
==50==Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
==51==That’s by me wounded; both our remedies
==52==Within thy help and holy physic lies.
==53==I bear no hatred, blessed man, for lo
==54==My intercession likewise steads my foe.

**FRI. L.**
==55==Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift,
==56==Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

**ROM.**
==57==Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
==58==On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
==59==As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
==60==And all combin’d, save what thou must combine
==61==By holy marriage. When and where and how
==62==We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
==63==I’ll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray,
==64==That thou consent to marry us today.

**FRI. L.**
==65==Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
==66==Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
==67==So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
==68==Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
==69==Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
==70==Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
==71==How much salt water thrown away in waste,
==72==To season love, that of it doth not taste!
==73==The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
==74==Thy old groans yet ringing in mine ancient ears;
==75==Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
==76==Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
==77==If e’er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
==78==Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
==79==And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then:
==80==Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.

**ROM.**
==81==Thou chidst me oft for loving Rosaline.

**FRI. L.**
==82==For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

**ROM.**
==83==And badst me bury love.

**FRI. L.**
==83==              Not in a grave,
==84==To lay one in, another out to have.

**ROM.**
==85==I pray thee chide me not. Her I love now
==86==Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
==87==The other did not so.

**FRI. L.**
==87==           O, she knew well
==88==Thy love did read by rote that could not spell.
==89==But come, young waverer, come go with me,
==90==In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
==91==For this alliance may so happy prove
==92==To turn your households’ rancor to pure love.

**ROM.**
==93==O, let us hence, I stand on sudden haste.

**FRI. L.**
==94==Wisely and slow, they stumble that run fast.

*Exeunt.*
