## Act 3, Scene 6
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 7|Act 3, Scene 7 →]]

*A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.*

*Enter Kent disguised as Caius and Gloucester.*

**GLOU.**
==1== Here is better than the open air, take it thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can. I will not be long from you.

**KENT.**
==2== All the pow’r of his wits have given way to his impatience. The gods reward your kindness!

*Exit Gloucester.*

*Enter Lear, Edgar as Poor Tom, and Fool.*

**EDG.**
==3== Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

**FOOL.**
==4== Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman?

**LEAR.**
==5== A king, a king!

**FOOL.**
==6== No, he’s a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he’s a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.

**LEAR.**
==7== To have a thousand with red burning spits
==8== Come hizzing in upon ’em⁠—

**EDG.**
==9== The foul fiend bites my back.

**FOOL.**
==10== He’s mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse’s health, a boy’s love, or a whore’s oath.

**LEAR.**
==11== It shall be done, I will arraign them straight.
*(To Edgar.)*
==12== Come sit thou here, most learned justicer;
*(To the Fool.)*
==13== Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she-foxes⁠—

**EDG.**
==14== Look where he stands and glares! Want’st thou eyes at trial, madam?
*(Sings.)*
==15== *“Come o’er the bourn, Bessy, to me”⁠—*

**FOOL.**
*(Sings.)*
==16== *Her boat hath a leak,*
==17== *And she must not speak*
==18== *Why she dares not come over to thee.*

**EDG.**
==19== The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a nightingale. Hoppedance cries in Tom’s belly for two white herring. Croak not, black angel, I have no food for thee.

**KENT.**
==20== How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz’d.
==21== Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

**LEAR.**
==22== I’ll see their trial first, bring in their evidence.
*(To Edgar.)*
==23== Thou robed man of justice, take thy place,
*(To the Fool.)*
==24== And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
==25== Bench by his side.
*(To Kent.)*
==26== You are o’ th’ commission,
==27== Sit you too.

**EDG.**
==27==     Let us deal justly.
*(Sings.)*
==28== *Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?*
==29== *Thy sheep be in the corn,*
==30== *And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,*
==31== *Thy sheep shall take no harm.*
==32== *Purr the cat is grey.*

**LEAR.**
==33== Arraign her first, ’tis Goneril. I here take my oath before this honorable assembly, she kick’d the poor king her father.

**FOOL.**
==34== Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

**LEAR.**
==35== She cannot deny it.

**FOOL.**
==36== Cry you mercy, I took you for a join-stool.

**LEAR.**
==37== And here’s another, whose warp’d looks proclaim
==38== What store her heart is made an. Stop her there!
==39== Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
==40== False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?

**EDG.**
==41== Bless thy five wits!

**KENT.**
==42== O pity! Sir, where is the patience now
==43== That you so oft have boasted to retain?

**EDG.**
*(Aside.)*
==44== My tears begin to take his part so much,
==45== They mar my counterfeiting.

**LEAR.**
==46== The little dogs and all,
==47== Trey, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.

**EDG.**
==48== Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
==49== *Be thy mouth or black or white,*
==50== *Tooth that poisons if it bite;*
==51== *Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,*
==52== *Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,*
==53== *Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,*
==54== *Tom will make him weep and wail,*
==55== *For with throwing thus my head,*
==56== *Dogs leapt the hatch, and all are fled.*
==57== Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and market towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.

**LEAR.**
==58== Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that make these hard hearts?
*(To Edgar.)*
==59== You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments. You will say they are Persian, but let them be chang’d.

**KENT.**
==60== Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

**LEAR.**
==61== Make no noise, make no noise, draw the curtains. So, so; we’ll go to supper i’ th’ morning.

**FOOL.**
==62== And I’ll go to bed at noon.

*Enter Gloucester.*

**GLOU.**
==63== Come hither, friend; where is the King my master?

**KENT.**
==64== Here, sir, but trouble him not—his wits are gone.

**GLOU.**
==65== Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms;
==66== I have o’erheard a plot of death upon him.
==67== There is a litter ready, lay him in’t,
==68== And drive toward Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
==69== Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master;
==70== If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
==71== With thine and all that offer to defend him,
==72== Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up,
==73== And follow me, that will to some provision
==74== Give thee quick conduct.

**KENT.**
==74==               Oppressed nature sleeps.
==75== This rest might yet have balm’d thy broken sinews,
==76== Which, if convenience will not allow,
==77== Stand in hard cure.
*(To the Fool.)*
==78== Come help to bear thy master;
==79== Thou must not stay behind.

**GLOU.**
==79==                 Come, come, away.

*Exeunt all but Edgar.*

**EDG.**
==80== When we our betters see bearing our woes,
==81== We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
==82== Who alone suffers, suffers most i’ th’ mind,
==83== Leaving free things and happy shows behind,
==84== But then the mind much sufferance doth o’erskip,
==85== When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
==86== How light and portable my pain seems now,
==87== When that which makes me bend makes the King bow:
==88== He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!
==89== Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray
==90== When false opinion, whose wrong thoughts defile thee,
==91== In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee.
==92== What will hap more tonight, safe scape the King!
==93== Lurk, lurk.

*Exit.*
