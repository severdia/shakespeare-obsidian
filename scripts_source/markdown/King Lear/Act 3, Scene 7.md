## Act 3, Scene 7
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Gloucester’s castle.*

*Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, Bastard Edmund, and Servants.*

**CORN.**
*(To Goneril.)*
==1==Post speedily to my lord your husband, show him this letter. The army of France is landed.—Seek out the traitor Gloucester.

*Exeunt some of the Servants.*

**REG.**
==2==Hang him instantly.

**GON.**
==3==Pluck out his eyes.

**CORN.**
==4==Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our sister company; the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke, where you are going, to a most festinate preparation; we are bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister, farewell, my Lord of Gloucester.
*(Enter Steward Oswald.)*
==5==How now? Where’s the King?

**OSW.**
==6==My Lord of Gloucester hath convey’d him hence.
==7==Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
==8==Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,
==9==Who, with some other of the lord’s dependents,
==10==Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast
==11==To have well-armed friends.

**CORN.**
==11==              Get horses for your mistress.

**GON.**
==12==Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

**CORN.**
==13==Edmund, farewell.
*(Exeunt Goneril, Edmund, and Oswald.)*
==13==           Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
==14==Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
*(Exeunt other Servants.)*
==15==Though well we may not pass upon his life
==16==Without the form of justice, yet our power
==17==Shall do a court’sy to our wrath, which men
==18==May blame, but not control.
*(Enter Gloucester, brought in by two or three Servants.)*
==18==              Who’s there? The traitor?

**REG.**
==19==Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.

**CORN.**
==20==Bind fast his corky arms.

**GLOU.**
==21==What means your Graces? Good my friends, consider
==22==You are my guests. Do me no foul play, friends.

**CORN.**
==23==Bind him, I say.

*Servants bind him.*

**REG.**
==23==        Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!

**GLOU.**
==24==Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.

**CORN.**
==25==To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find⁠—

*Regan plucks his beard.*

**GLOU.**
==26==By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done
==27==To pluck me by the beard.

**REG.**
==28==So white, and such a traitor?

**GLOU.**
==28==                Naughty lady,
==29==These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
==30==Will quicken and accuse thee. I am your host,
==31==With robber’s hands my hospitable favors
==32==You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?

**CORN.**
==33==Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?

**REG.**
==34==Be simple-answer’d, for we know the truth.

**CORN.**
==35==And what confederacy have you with the traitors
==36==Late footed in the kingdom?

**REG.**
==37==To whose hands you have sent the lunatic King⁠—
==38==Speak.

**GLOU.**
==39==I have a letter guessingly set down,
==40==Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart,
==41==And not from one oppos’d.

**CORN.**
==41==                Cunning.

**REG.**
==41==                       And false.

**CORN.**
==42==Where hast thou sent the King?

**GLOU.**
==43==To Dover.

**REG.**
==44==Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg’d at peril⁠—

**CORN.**
==45==Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that.

**GLOU.**
==46==I am tied to th’ stake, and I must stand the course.

**REG.**
==47==Wherefore to Dover?

**GLOU.**
==48==Because I would not see thy cruel nails
==49==Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister
==50==In his anointed flesh rash boarish fangs.
==51==The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
==52==In hell-black night endur’d, would have buoy’d up
==53==And quench’d the stelled fires;
==54==Yet, poor old heart, he help the heavens to rain.
==55==If wolves had at thy gate howl’d that dearn time,
==56==Thou shouldst have said, “Good porter, turn the key.”
==57==All cruels else subscribe; but I shall see
==58==The winged vengeance overtake such children.

**CORN.**
==59==See’t shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair,
==60==Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.

**GLOU.**
==61==He that will think to live till he be old,
==62==Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!

**REG.**
==63==One side will mock another; th’ other too.

**CORN.**
==64==If you see vengeance⁠—

**1. SERV.**
==64==           Hold your hand, my lord!
==65==I have serv’d you ever since I was a child;
==66==But better service have I never done you
==67==Than now to bid you hold.

**REG.**
==67==              How now, you dog?

**1. SERV.**
==68==If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
==69==I’ld shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?

**CORN.**
==70==My villain!

*Draw and fight.*

**1. SERV.**
==71==Nay then come on, and take the chance of anger.

*Cornwall is wounded.*

**REG.**
==72==Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?

*She takes a sword and runs at him behind; kills him.*

**1. SERV.**
==73==O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
==74==To see some mischief on him. O!

*He dies.*

**CORN.**
==75==Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vild jelly!
==76==Where is thy lustre now?

**GLOU.**
==77==All dark and comfortless! Where’s my son Edmund?
==78==Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
==79==To quit this horrid act.

**REG.**
==79==              Out, treacherous villain!
==80==Thou call’st on him that hates thee. It was he
==81==That made the overture of thy treasons to us,
==82==Who is too good to pity thee.

**GLOU.**
==83==O my follies! Then Edgar was abus’d.
==84==Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!

**REG.**
==85==Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
==86==His way to Dover.
*(Exit one with Gloucester.)*
==86==        How is’t, my lord? How look you?

**CORN.**
==87==I have receiv’d a hurt; follow me, lady.⁠—
==88==Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
==89==Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace,
==90==Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.

*Exit, led by Regan.*

**2. SERV.**
==91==I’ll never care what wickedness I do,
==92==If this man come to good.

**3. SERV.**
==92==              If she live long,
==93==And in the end meet the old course of death,
==94==Women will all turn monsters.

**2. SERV.**
==95==Let’s follow the old Earl, and get the Bedlam
==96==To lead him where he would; his roguish madness
==97==Allows itself to any thing.

**3. SERV.**
==98==Go thou. I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
==99==To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!

*Exeunt severally.*
