## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*The Earl of Gloucester’s castle.*

*Enter Bastard Edmund and Curan severally.*

**EDM.**
==1==’Save thee, Curan.

**CUR.**
==2==And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his duchess will be here with him this night.

**EDM.**
==3==How comes that?

**CUR.**
==4==Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad, I mean the whisper’d ones, for they are yet but ear-bussing arguments?

**EDM.**
==5==Not I. Pray you, what are they?

**CUR.**
==6==Have you heard of no likely wars toward, ’twixt the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?

**EDM.**
==7==Not a word.

**CUR.**
==8==You may do then in time. Fare you well, sir.

*Exit.*

**EDM.**
==9==The Duke be here tonight? The better! Best!
==10==This weaves itself perforce into my business.
==11==My father hath set guard to take my brother,
==12==And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
==13==Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!
==14==Brother, a word! Descend. Brother, I say!
*(Enter Edgar.)*
==15==My father watches: O sir, fly this place,
==16==Intelligence is given where you are hid;
==17==You have now the good advantage of the night.
==18==Have you not spoken ’gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
==19==He’s coming hither, now i’ th’ night, i’ th’ haste,
==20==And Regan with him. Have you nothing said
==21==Upon his party ’gainst the Duke of Albany?
==22==Advise yourself.

**EDG.**
==23==I am sure on’t, not a word.

**EDM.**
==24==I hear my father coming. Pardon me:
==25==In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.
==26==Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.⁠—
==27==Yield! Come before my father. Light ho, here!⁠—
==28==Fly, brother.—Torches, torches!—So farewell.
*(Exit Edgar.)*
==29==Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
*(Wounds his arm.)*
==30==Of my more fierce endeavor. I have seen drunkards
==31==Do more than this in sport.—Father, father!
==32==Stop, stop! No help?

*Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.*

**GLOU.**
==33==Now, Edmund, where’s the villain?

**EDM.**
==34==Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
==35==Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
==36==To stand ’s auspicious mistress.

**GLOU.**
==36==                  But where is he?

**EDM.**
==37==Look, sir, I bleed.

**GLOU.**
==37==           Where is the villain, Edmund?

**EDM.**
==38==Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could⁠—

**GLOU.**
==39==Pursue him, ho! Go after.
*(Exeunt some Servants.)*
==39==              By no means what?

**EDM.**
==40==Persuade me to the murder of your lordship,
==41==But that I told him, the revengive gods
==42==’Gainst parricides did all the thunder bend,
==43==Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
==44==The child was bound to th’ father; sir, in fine,
==45==Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
==46==To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion
==47==With his prepared sword he charges home
==48==My unprovided body, latch’d mine arm;
==49==And when he saw my best alarum’d spirits,
==50==Bold in the quarrel’s right, rous’d to th’ encounter,
==51==Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
==52==Full suddenly he fled.

**GLOU.**
==52==           Let him fly far.
==53==Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
==54==And found—dispatch. The noble Duke my master,
==55==My worthy arch and patron, comes tonight.
==56==By his authority I will proclaim it,
==57==That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
==58==Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
==59==He that conceals him, death.

**EDM.**
==60==When I dissuaded him from his intent,
==61==And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
==62==I threaten’d to discover him; he replied,
==63==“Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
==64==If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
==65==Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
==66==Make thy words faith’d? No. What I should deny
==67==(As this I would, ay, though thou didst produce
==68==My very character), I’ld turn it all
==69==To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;
==70==And thou must make a dullard of the world
==71==If they not thought the profits of my death
==72==Were very pregnant and potential spirits
==73==To make thee seek it.”

**GLOU.**
==73==           O strange and fast’ned villain!
==74==Would he deny his letter, said he? I never got him.
*(Tucket within.)*
==75==Hark, the Duke’s trumpets! I know not why he comes.
==76==All ports I’ll bar, the villain shall not scape;
==77==The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture
==78==I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
==79==May have due note of him, and of my land,
==80==Loyal and natural boy, I’ll work the means
==81==To make thee capable.

*Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.*

**CORN.**
==82==How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither
==83==(Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news.

**REG.**
==84==If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
==85==Which can pursue th’ offender. How dost, my lord?

**GLOU.**
==86==O madam, my old heart is crack’d, it’s crack’d!

**REG.**
==87==What, did my father’s godson seek your life?
==88==He whom my father nam’d, your Edgar?

**GLOU.**
==89==O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

**REG.**
==90==Was he not companion with the riotous knights
==91==That tended upon my father?

**GLOU.**
==92==I know not, madam. ’Tis too bad, too bad.

**EDM.**
==93==Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

**REG.**
==94==No marvel then, though he were ill affected:
==95==’Tis they have put him on the old man’s death,
==96==To have th’ expense and waste of his revenues.
==97==I have this present evening from my sister
==98==Been well inform’d of them, and with such cautions,
==99==That if they come to sojourn at my house,
==100==I’ll not be there.

**CORN.**
==100==        Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
==101==Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
==102==A child-like office.

**EDM.**
==102==           It was my duty, sir.

**GLOU.**
==103==He did bewray his practice, and receiv’d
==104==This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

**CORN.**
==105==Is he pursued?

**GLOU.**
==105==        Ay, my good lord.

**CORN.**
==106==If he be taken, he shall never more
==107==Be fear’d of doing harm. Make your own purpose,
==108==How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
==109==Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
==110==So much commend itself, you shall be ours.
==111==Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
==112==You we first seize on.

**EDM.**
==112==           I shall serve you, sir,
==113==Truly, however else.

**GLOU.**
==113==           For him I thank your Grace.

**CORN.**
==114==You know not why we came to visit you?

**REG.**
==115==Thus out of season, threading dark-ey’d night:
==116==Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some prize,
==117==Wherein we must have use of your advice.
==118==Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
==119==Of differences, which I best thought it fit
==120==To answer from our home; the several messengers
==121==From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
==122==Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
==123==Your needful counsel to our businesses,
==124==Which craves the instant use.

**GLOU.**
==124==                I serve you, madam.
==125==Your Graces are right welcome.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
