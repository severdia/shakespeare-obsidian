## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*A heath.*

*Storm still. Enter Kent disguised as Caius and First Gentleman severally.*

**KENT.**
==1== Who’s there, besides foul weather?

**1. GENT.**
==2== One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

**KENT.**
==3== I know you. Where’s the King?

**1. GENT.**
==4== Contending with the fretful elements;
==5== Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,
==6== Or swell the curled waters ’bove the main,
==7== That things might change or cease, tears his white hair,
==8== Which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage
==9== Catch in their fury, and make nothing of,
==10== Strives in his little world of man to outscorn
==11== The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
==12== This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
==13== The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
==14== Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
==15== And bids what will take all.

**KENT.**
==15==               But who is with him?

**1. GENT.**
==16== None but the Fool, who labors to outjest
==17== His heart-struck injuries.

**KENT.**
==17==               Sir, I do know you,
==18== And dare upon the warrant of my note
==19== Commend a dear thing to you. There is division
==20== (Although as yet the face of it is cover’d
==21== With mutual cunning) ’twixt Albany and Cornwall;
==22== Who have—as who have not, that their great stars
==23== Thron’d and set high?—servants, who seem no less,
==24== Which are to France the spies and speculations
==25== Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,
==26== Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,
==27== Or the hard rein which both of them hath borne
==28== Against the old kind King; or something deeper,
==29== Whereof (perchance) these are but furnishings⁠—
==30== But true it is, from France there comes a power
==31== Into this scattered kingdom, who already
==32== Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
==33== In some of our best ports, and are at point
==34== To show their open banner. Now to you:
==35== If on my credit you dare build so far
==36== To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
==37== Some that will thank you, making just report
==38== Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
==39== The King hath cause to plain.
==40== I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
==41== And from some knowledge and assurance, offer
==42== This office to you.

**1. GENT.**
==43== I will talk further with you.

**KENT.**
==43==               No, do not.
==44== For confirmation that I am much more
==45== Than my out-wall, open this purse and take
==46== What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia
==47== (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,
==48== And she will tell you who that fellow is
==49== That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
==50== I will go seek the King.

**1. GENT.**
==51== Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?

**KENT.**
==52== Few words, but to effect, more than all yet:
==53== That when we have found the King—in which your pain
==54== That way, I’ll this—he that first lights on him
==55== Holla the other.

*Exeunt severally.*
