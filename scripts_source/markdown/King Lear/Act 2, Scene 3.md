## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*A wood.*

*Enter Edgar.*

**EDG.**
==1== I heard myself proclaim’d,
==2== And by the happy hollow of a tree
==3== Escap’d the hunt. No port is free, no place
==4== That guard and most unusual vigilance
==5== Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape
==6== I will preserve myself, and am bethought
==7== To take the basest and most poorest shape
==8== That ever penury, in contempt of man,
==9== Brought near to beast. My face I’ll grime with filth,
==10== Blanket my loins, elf all my hairs in knots,
==11== And with presented nakedness outface
==12== The winds and persecutions of the sky.
==13== The country gives me proof and president
==14== Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
==15== Strike in their numb’d and mortified arms
==16== Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
==17== And with this horrible object, from low farms,
==18== Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
==19== Sometimes with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
==20== Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! Poor Tom!
==21== That’s something yet: Edgar I nothing am.

*Exit.*
