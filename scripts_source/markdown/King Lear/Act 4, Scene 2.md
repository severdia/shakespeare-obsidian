## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Before the Duke of Albany’s palace.*

*Enter Goneril, Bastard Edmund.*

**GON.**
==1==Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband
==2==Not met us on the way.
*(Enter Oswald, the Steward.)*
==3==Now, where’s your master?

**OSW.**
==4==Madam, within, but never man so chang’d.
==5==I told him of the army that was landed;
==6==He smil’d at it. I told him you were coming;
==7==His answer was, “The worse.” Of Gloucester’s treachery,
==8==And of the loyal service of his son,
==9==When I inform’d him, then he call’d me sot,
==10==And told me I had turn’d the wrong side out.
==11==What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
==12==What like, offensive.

**GON.**
*(To Edmund.)*
==12==           Then shall you go no further.
==13==It is the cowish terror of his spirit
==14==That dares not undertake; he’ll not feel wrongs
==15==Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
==16==May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother,
==17==Hasten his musters and conduct his pow’rs.
==18==I must change names at home, and give the distaff
==19==Into my husband’s hands. This trusty servant
==20==Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear
==21==(If you dare venture in your own behalf) 
==22==A mistress’s command. Wear this; spare speech.
==23==Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
==24==Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
==25==Conceive, and fare thee well.

**EDM.**
==26==Yours in the ranks of death.

*Exit.*

**GON.**
==26==                My most dear Gloucester!
==27==O, the difference of man and man!
==28==To thee a woman’s services are due,
==29==A fool usurps my bed.

**OSW.**
==29==           Madam, here comes my lord.

*Exit.*

*Enter Albany.*

**GON.**
==30==I have been worth the whistling.

**ALB.**
==30==                  O Goneril,
==31==You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
==32==Blows in your face. I fear your disposition;
==33==That nature which contemns it origin
==34==Cannot be bordered certain in itself.
==35==She that herself will sliver and disbranch
==36==From her material sap, perforce must wither,
==37==And come to deadly use.

**GON.**
==38==No more, the text is foolish.

**ALB.**
==39==Wisdom and goodness to the vild seem vild,
==40==Filths savor but themselves. What have you done?
==41==Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform’d?
==42==A father, and a gracious aged man,
==43==Whose reverence even the head-lugg’d bear would lick,
==44==Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.
==45==Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
==46==A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
==47==If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
==48==Send quickly down to tame these vild offenses,
==49==It will come,
==50==Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
==51==Like monsters of the deep.

**GON.**
==51==              Milk-liver’d man,
==52==That bear’st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs,
==53==Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
==54==Thine honor from thy suffering, that not know’st
==55==Fools do those villains pity who are punish’d
==56==Ere they have done their mischief, where’s thy drum?
==57==France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
==58==With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,
==59==Whilst thou, a moral fool, sits still and cries,
==60==“Alack, why does he so?”

**ALB.**
==60==              See thyself, devil!
==61==Proper deformity shows not in the fiend
==62==So horrid as in woman.

**GON.**
==62==              O vain fool!

**ALB.**
==63==Thou changed and self-cover’d thing, for shame
==64==Bemonster not thy feature. Were’t my fitness
==65==To let these hands obey my blood,
==66==They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
==67==Thy flesh and bones. Howe’er thou art a fiend,
==68==A woman’s shape doth shield thee.

**GON.**
==69==Marry, your manhood mew!

*Enter First Messenger.*

**ALB.**
==70==What news?

**1. MESS.**
==71==O my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall’s dead,
==72==Slain by his servant, going to put out
==73==The other eye of Gloucester.

**ALB.**
==73==              Gloucester’s eyes?

**1. MESS.**
==74==A servant that he bred, thrill’d with remorse,
==75==Oppos’d against the act, bending his sword
==76==To his great master, who, thereat enraged,
==77==Flew on him, and amongst them fell’d him dead,
==78==But not without that harmful stroke which since
==79==Hath pluck’d him after.

**ALB.**
==79==              This shows you are above,
==80==You justicers, that these our nether crimes
==81==So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester,
==82==Lost he his other eye?

**1. MESS.**
==82==           Both, both, my lord.
==83==This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
==84==’Tis from your sister.

**GON.**
*(Aside.)*
==84==           One way I like this well,
==85==But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
==86==May all the building in my fancy pluck
==87==Upon my hateful life. Another way,
==88==The news is not so tart.—I’ll read, and answer.

*Exit.*

**ALB.**
==89==Where was his son when they did take his eyes?

**1. MESS.**
==90==Come with my lady hither.

**ALB.**
==90==              He is not here.

**1. MESS.**
==91==No, my good lord, I met him back again.

**ALB.**
==92==Knows he the wickedness?

**1. MESS.**
==93==Ay, my good lord; ’twas he inform’d against him,
==94==And quit the house on purpose that their punishment
==95==Might have the freer course.

**ALB.**
==95==              Gloucester, I live
==96==To thank thee for the love thou show’dst the King,
==97==And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend,
==98==Tell me what more thou know’st.

*Exeunt.*
