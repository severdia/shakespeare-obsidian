## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 6|Act 3, Scene 6 →]]

*Gloucester’s castle.*

*Enter Cornwall and Edmund.*

**CORN.**
I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.

**EDM.**
How, my lord, I may be censur’d, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of.

**CORN.**
I now perceive, it was not altogether your brother’s evil disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable badness in himself.

**EDM.**
How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to be just! This is the letter which he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens! That this treason were not; or not I the detector!

**CORN.**
Go with me to the Duchess.

**EDM.**
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand.

**CORN.**
True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension.

**EDM.**
*(Aside.)*
If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff his suspicion more fully.—I will persever in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.

**CORN.**
I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love.

*Exeunt.*
