## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*The Duke of Albany’s palace.*

*Enter Goneril and Steward Oswald.*

**GON.**
==1==Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his Fool?

**OSW.**
==2==Ay, madam.

**GON.**
==3==By day and night he wrongs me, every hour
==4==He flashes into one gross crime or other
==5==That sets us all at odds. I’ll not endure it.
==6==His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
==7==On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
==8==I will not speak with him; say I am sick.
==9==If you come slack of former services,
==10==You shall do well; the fault of it I’ll answer.

*Horns within.*

**OSW.**
==11==He’s coming, madam, I hear him.

**GON.**
==12==Put on what weary negligence you please,
==13==You and your fellows; I’d have it come to question.
==14==If he distaste it, let him to my sister,
==15==Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
==16==Not to be overrul’d. Idle old man,
==17==That still would manage those authorities
==18==That he hath given away! Now by my life
==19==Old fools are babes again, and must be us’d
==20==With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus’d.
==21==Remember what I have said.

**OSW.**
==21==                Well, madam.

**GON.**
==22==And let his knights have colder looks among you;
==23==What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.
==24==I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
==25==That I may speak. I’ll write straight to my sister
==26==To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.

*Exeunt.*
