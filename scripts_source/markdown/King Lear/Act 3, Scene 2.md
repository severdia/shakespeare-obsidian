## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Another part of the heath.*

*Storm still. Enter Lear and Fool.*

**LEAR.**
==1==Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow!
==2==You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
==3==Till you have drench’d our steeples, drown’d the cocks!
==4==You sulph’rous and thought-executing fires,
==5==Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
==6==Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
==7==Strike flat the thick rotundity o’ th’ world!
==8==Crack nature’s moulds, all germains spill at once
==9==That makes ingrateful man!

**FOOL.**
==10==O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry house is better than this rain-water out o’ door. Good nuncle, in, ask thy daughters blessing. Here’s a night pities neither wise men nor fools.

**LEAR.**
==11==Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! Spout, rain!
==12==Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.
==13==I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
==14==I never gave you kingdom, call’d you children;
==15==You owe me no subscription. Then let fall
==16==Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,
==17==A poor, infirm, weak, and despis’d old man;
==18==But yet I call you servile ministers,
==19==That will with two pernicious daughters join
==20==Your high-engender’d battles ’gainst a head
==21==So old and white as this. O, ho! ’Tis foul.

**FOOL.**
==22==He that has a house to put ’s head in has a good head-piece.
==23==*The codpiece that will house*
==23==    *Before the head has any,*
==24==*The head and he shall louse:*
==24==    *So beggars marry many.*
==25==*The man that makes his toe*
==25==    *What he his heart should make,*
==26==*Shall of a corn cry woe,*
==26==    *And turn his sleep to wake.*
==27==For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass.

*Enter Kent disguised as Caius.*

**LEAR.**
==28==No, I will be the pattern of all patience, I will say nothing.

**KENT.**
==29==Who’s there?

**FOOL.**
==30==Marry, here’s grace and a codpiece—that’s a wise man and a fool.

**KENT.**
==31==Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night
==32==Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies
==33==Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
==34==And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,
==35==Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
==36==Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
==37==Remember to have heard. Man’s nature cannot carry
==38==Th’ affliction nor the fear.

**LEAR.**
==38==              Let the great gods,
==39==That keep this dreadful pudder o’er our heads,
==40==Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch
==41==That hast within thee undivulged crimes
==42==Unwhipt of justice! Hide thee, thou bloody hand;
==43==Thou perjur’d, and thou simular of virtue
==44==That art incestuous! Caitiff, to pieces shake,
==45==That under covert and convenient seeming
==46==Has practic’d on man’s life! Close pent-up guilts,
==47==Rive your concealing continents, and cry
==48==These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
==49==More sinn’d against than sinning.

**KENT.**
==49==                  Alack, bare-headed?
==50==Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel,
==51==Some friendship will it lend you ’gainst the tempest.
==52==Repose you there, while I to this hard house
==53==(More harder than the stones whereof ’tis rais’d,
==54==Which even but now, demanding after you,
==55==Denied me to come in) return, and force
==56==Their scanted courtesy.

**LEAR.**
==56==              My wits begin to turn.
==57==Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?
==58==I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
==59==The art of our necessities is strange
==60==And can make vild things precious. Come, your hovel.
==61==Poor Fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
==62==That’s sorry yet for thee.

**FOOL.**
*(Sings.)*
==63==*“He that has and a little tiny wit⁠—*
==64==*With heigh-ho, the wind and the rain⁠—*
==65==*Must make content with his fortunes fit,*
==66==*Though the rain it raineth every day.”*

**LEAR.**
==67==True, boy. Come bring us to this hovel.

*Exit with Kent.*

**FOOL.**
==68==This is a brave night to cool a courtezan. I’ll speak a prophecy ere I go:
==69==*When priests are more in word than matter;*
==70==*When brewers mar their malt with water;*
==71==*When nobles are their tailors’ tutors;*
==72==*No heretics burn’d, but wenches’ suitors;*
==73==*Then shall the realm of Albion*
==74==*Come to great confusion.*
==75==*When every case in law is right;*
==76==*No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;*
==77==*When slanders do not live in tongues;*
==78==*Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;*
==79==*When usurers tell their gold i’ th’ field,*
==80==*And bawds and whores do churches build;*
==81==*Then comes the time, who lives to see’t,*
==82==*That going shall be us’d with feet.*
==83==This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.

*Exit.*
