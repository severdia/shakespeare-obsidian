## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 7|Act 4, Scene 7 →]]

*Fields near Dover.*

*Enter Gloucester and Edgar dressed like a peasant.*

**GLOU.**
==1==When shall I come to th’ top of that same hill?

**EDG.**
==2==You do climb up it now. Look how we labor.

**GLOU.**
==3==Methinks the ground is even.

**EDG.**
==3==                Horrible steep.
==4==Hark, do you hear the sea?

**GLOU.**
==4==              No, truly.

**EDG.**
==5==Why then your other senses grow imperfect
==6==By your eyes’ anguish.

**GLOU.**
==6==              So may it be indeed.
==7==Methinks thy voice is alter’d, and thou speak’st
==8==In better phrase and matter than thou didst.

**EDG.**
==9==Y’ are much deceiv’d. In nothing am I chang’d
==10==But in my garments.

**GLOU.**
==10==           Methinks y’ are better spoken.

**EDG.**
==11==Come on, sir, here’s the place; stand still. How fearful
==12==And dizzy ’tis, to cast one’s eyes so low!
==13==The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
==14==Show scarce so gross as beetles. Half way down
==15==Hangs one that gathers sampire, dreadful trade!
==16==Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.
==17==The fishermen that walk upon the beach
==18==Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
==19==Diminish’d to her cock; her cock, a buoy
==20==Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,
==21==That on th’ unnumb’red idle pebble chafes,
==22==Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more,
==23==Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
==24==Topple down headlong.

**GLOU.**
==24==              Set me where you stand.

**EDG.**
==25==Give me your hand. You are now within a foot
==26==Of th’ extreme verge. For all beneath the moon
==27==Would I not leap upright.

**GLOU.**
==27==              Let go my hand.
==28==Here, friend, ’s another purse; in it a jewel
==29==Well worth a poor man’s taking. Fairies and gods
==30==Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off:
==31==Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

**EDG.**
==32==Now fare ye well, good sir.

**GLOU.**
==33==With all my heart.

**EDG.**
*(Aside.)*
==34==Why I do trifle thus with his despair
==35==Is done to cure it.

**GLOU.**
==35==           O you mighty gods!
*(He kneels.)*
==36==This world I do renounce, and in your sights
==37==Shake patiently my great affliction off.
==38==If I could bear it longer, and not fall
==39==To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
==40==My snuff and loathed part of nature should
==41==Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O bless him!
==42==Now, fellow, fare thee well.

*He falls.*

**EDG.**
==42==                Gone, sir; farewell!
==43==And yet I know not how conceit may rob
==44==The treasury of life, when life itself
==45==Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,
==46==By this had thought been past. Alive or dead?⁠—
==47==Ho, you, sir! Friend! Hear you, sir! Speak!⁠—
==48==Thus might he pass indeed; yet he revives.⁠—
==49==What are you, sir?

**GLOU.**
==49==           Away, and let me die.

**EDG.**
==50==Hadst thou been aught but goss’mer, feathers, air
==51==(So many fathom down precipitating),
==52==Thou’dst shiver’d like an egg: but thou dost breathe,
==53==Hast heavy substance, bleed’st not, speak’st, art sound.
==54==Ten masts at each make not the altitude
==55==Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
==56==Thy life’s a miracle. Speak yet again.

**GLOU.**
==57==But have I fall’n, or no?

**EDG.**
==58==From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
==59==Look up a-height, the shrill-gorg’d lark so far
==60==Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.

**GLOU.**
==61==Alack, I have no eyes.
==62==Is wretchedness depriv’d that benefit,
==63==To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some comfort,
==64==When misery could beguile the tyrant’s rage,
==65==And frustrate his proud will.

**EDG.**
==65==              Give me your arm.
==66==Up—so. How is’t? Feel you your legs? You stand.

**GLOU.**
==67==Too well, too well.

**EDG.**
==67==           This is above all strangeness.
==68==Upon the crown o’ th’ cliff, what thing was that
==69==Which parted from you?

**GLOU.**
==69==              A poor unfortunate beggar.

**EDG.**
==70==As I stood here below, methought his eyes
==71==Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
==72==Horns welk’d and waved like the enridged sea.
==73==It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
==74==Think that the clearest gods, who make them honors
==75==Of men’s impossibilities, have preserved thee.

**GLOU.**
==76==I do remember now. Henceforth I’ll bear
==77==Affliction till it do cry out itself
==78==“Enough, enough,” and die. That thing you speak of,
==79==I took it for a man; often ’twould say,
==80==“The fiend, the fiend!”—he led me to that place.

**EDG.**
==81==Bear free and patient thoughts.
*(Enter Lear mad, crowned with weeds and flowers.)*
==81==                  But who comes here?
==82==The safer sense will ne’er accommodate
==83==His master thus.

**LEAR.**
==84==No, they cannot touch me for coining, I am the King himself.

**EDG.**
==85==O thou side—piercing sight!

**LEAR.**
==86==Nature’s above art in that respect. There’s your press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper; draw me a clothier’s yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do’t. There’s my gauntlet, I’ll prove it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! I’ th’ clout, i’ th’ clout—hewgh! Give the word.

**EDG.**
==87==Sweet marjorum.

**LEAR.**
==88==Pass.

**GLOU.**
==89==I know that voice.

**LEAR.**
==90==Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter’d me like a dog, and told me I had the white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. To say “ay” and “no” to every thing that I said! “Ay,” and “no” too, was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter, when the thunder would not peace at my bidding, there I found ’em, there I smelt ’em out. Go to, they are not men o’ their words: they told me I was every thing. ’Tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.

**GLOU.**
==91==The trick of that voice I do well remember;
==92==Is’t not the King?

**LEAR.**
==92==           Ay, every inch a king!
==93==When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
==94==I pardon that man’s life. What was thy cause?
==95==Adultery?
==96==Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No,
==97==The wren goes to’t, and the small gilded fly
==98==Does lecher in my sight.
==99==Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester’s bastard son
==100==Was kinder to his father than my daughters
==101==Got ’tween the lawful sheets.
==102==To’t, luxury, pell-mell, for I lack soldiers.
==103==Behold yond simp’ring dame,
==104==Whose face between her forks presages snow;
==105==That minces virtue, and does shake the head
==106==To hear of pleasure’s name⁠—
==107==The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to’t
==108==With a more riotous appetite.
==109==Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
==110==Though women all above;
==111==But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
==112==Beneath is all the fiends’: there’s hell, there’s darkness,
==113==There is the sulfurous pit, burning, scalding,
==114==Stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! Pah, pah!
==115==Give me an ounce of civet; good apothecary,
==116==Sweeten my imagination. There’s money for thee.

**GLOU.**
==117==O, let me kiss that hand!

**LEAR.**
==118==Let me wipe it first, it smells of mortality.

**GLOU.**
==119==O ruin’d piece of nature! This great world
==120==Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?

**LEAR.**
==121==I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid, I’ll not love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it.

**GLOU.**
==122==Were all thy letters suns, I could not see.

**EDG.**
*(Aside.)*
==123==I would not take this from report; it is,
==124==And my heart breaks at it.

**LEAR.**
==125==Read.

**GLOU.**
==126==What, with the case of eyes?

**LEAR.**
==127==O ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light, yet you see how this world goes.

**GLOU.**
==128==I see it feelingly.

**LEAR.**
==129==What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes with no eyes. Look with thine ears; see how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark in thine ear: change places, and handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a farmer’s dog bark at a beggar?

**GLOU.**
==130==Ay, sir.

**LEAR.**
==131==And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog’s obey’d in office.
==132==Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
==133==Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back,
==134==Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
==135==For which thou whip’st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
==136==Thorough tatter’d clothes small vices do appear;
==137==Robes and furr’d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
==138==And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
==139==Arm it in rags, a pigmy’s straw does pierce it.
==140==None does offend, none, I say none, I’ll able ’em.
==141==Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
==142==To seal th’ accuser’s lips. Get thee glass eyes,
==143==And like a scurvy politician, seem
==144==To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now.
==145==Pull off my boots; harder, harder-so.

**EDG.**
*(Aside.)*
==146==O, matter and impertinency mix’d,
==147==Reason in madness!

**LEAR.**
==148==If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
==149==I know thee well enough, thy name is Gloucester.
==150==Thou must be patient; we came crying hither.
==151==Thou know’st, the first time that we smell the air
==152==We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.

*Lear takes off his crown of weeds and flowers.*

**GLOU.**
==153==Alack, alack the day!

**LEAR.**
==154==When we are born, we cry that we are come
==155==To this great stage of fools.—This’ a good block.
==156==It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
==157==A troop of horse with felt. I’ll put’t in proof,
==158==And when I have stol’n upon these son-in-laws,
==159==Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

*Enter First Gentleman with Attendants.*

**1. GENT.**
==160==O, here he is: lay hand upon him.—Sir,
==161==Your most dear daughter⁠—

**LEAR.**
==162==No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
==163==The natural fool of fortune. Use me well,
==164==You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons,
==165==I am cut to th’ brains.

**1. GENT.**
==165==           You shall have any thing.

**LEAR.**
==166==No seconds? All myself?
==167==Why, this would make a man a man of salt
==168==To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
==169==Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.

**1. GENT.**
==169==                Good sir⁠—

**LEAR.**
==170==I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What?
==171==I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king,
==172==Masters, know you that?

**1. GENT.**
==173==You are a royal one, and we obey you.

**LEAR.**
==174==Then there’s life in’t. Come, and you get it, you shall get it by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.

*Exit running; Attendants follow.*

**1. GENT.**
==175==A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
==176==Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter
==177==Who redeems nature from the general curse
==178==Which twain have brought her to.

**EDG.**
==179==Hail, gentle sir.

**1. GENT.**
==179==        Sir, speed you: what’s your will?

**EDG.**
==180==Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?

**1. GENT.**
==181==Most sure and vulgar; every one hears that,
==182==Which can distinguish sound.

**EDG.**
==182==                But by your favor,
==183==How near’s the other army?

**1. GENT.**
==184==Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
==185==Stands on the hourly thought.

**EDG.**
==185==                I thank you, sir, that’s all.

**1. GENT.**
==186==Though that the Queen on special cause is here,
==187==Her army is mov’d on.

**EDG.**
==187==           I thank you, sir.

*Exit First Gentleman.*

**GLOU.**
==188==You ever—gentle gods, take my breath from me,
==189==Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
==190==To die before you please!

**EDG.**
==190==              Well pray you, father.

**GLOU.**
==191==Now, good sir, what are you?

**EDG.**
==192==A most poor man, made tame to fortune’s blows,
==193==Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
==194==Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
==195==I’ll lead you to some biding.

**GLOU.**
==195==                Hearty thanks;
==196==The bounty and the benison of heaven
==197==To boot, and boot!

*Enter Steward Oswald.*

**OSW.**
==198==A proclaim’d prize! Most happy!
==199==That eyeless head of thine was first fram’d flesh
==200==To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
==201==Briefly thyself remember; the sword is out
==202==That must destroy thee.

**GLOU.**
==202==              Now let thy friendly hand
==203==Put strength enough to’t.

*Edgar interposes.*

**OSW.**
==203==              Wherefore, bold peasant,
==204==Durst thou support a publish’d traitor? Hence,
==205==Lest that th’ infection of his fortune take
==206==Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.

**EDG.**
==207==Chill not let go, zir, without vurther cagion.

**OSW.**
==208==Let go, slave, or thou di’st!

**EDG.**
==209==Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. And chud ha’ bin zwagger’d out of my life, ’twould not ha’ bin zo long as ’tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th’ old man; keep out, che vor’ ye, or I’ce try whither your costard or my ballow be the harder. Chill be plain with you.

**OSW.**
==210==Out, dunghill!

*They fight.*

**EDG.**
==211==Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come, no matter vor your foins.

**OSW.**
==212==Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse:
==213==If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,
==214==And give the letters which thou find’st about me
==215==To Edmund Earl of Gloucester; seek him out
==216==Upon the English party. O untimely death!
==217==Death!

*He dies.*

**EDG.**
==218==I know thee well; a serviceable villain,
==219==As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
==220==As badness would desire.

**GLOU.**
==220==              What, is he dead?

**EDG.**
==221==Sit you down, father; rest you.
==222==Let’s see these pockets; the letters that he speaks of
==223==May be my friends. He’s dead; I am only sorry
==224==He had no other deathsman. Let us see.
==225==Leave, gentle wax, and, manners, blame us not:
==226==To know our enemies’ minds, we rip their hearts,
==227==Their papers is more lawful.
*(Reads the letter.)*
==228==*“Let our reciprocal vows be rememb’red. You have many opportunities to cut him off; if your will want not, time and place will be fruitfully offer’d. There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror; then am I the prisoner, and his bed my jail; from the loath’d warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labor. Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant, Goneril.”*
==229==O indistinguish’d space of woman’s will!
==230==A plot upon her virtuous husband’s life,
==231==And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
==232==Thee I’ll rake up, the post unsanctified
==233==Of murderous lechers; and in the mature time
==234==With this ungracious paper strike the sight
==235==Of the death-practic’d Duke. For him ’tis well
==236==That of thy death and business I can tell.

**GLOU.**
==237==The King is mad; how stiff is my vild sense
==238==That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
==239==Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract,
==240==So should my thoughts be sever’d from my griefs,
==241==And woes by wrong imaginations lose
==242==The knowledge of themselves.

*Drum afar off.*

**EDG.**
==242==                Give me your hand;
==243==Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.
==244==Come, father, I’ll bestow you with a friend.

*Exeunt.*
