## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 7|← Act 4, Scene 7]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*The British camp near Dover.*

*Enter, with Drum and Colors, Edmund, Regan, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.*

**EDM.**
==1==Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,
==2==Or whether since he is advis’d by aught
==3==To change the course. He’s full of alteration
==4==And self-reproving—bring his constant pleasure.

*To Second Gentleman, who goes out.*

**REG.**
==5==Our sister’s man is certainly miscarried.

**EDM.**
==6==’Tis to be doubted, madam.

**REG.**
==6==              Now, sweet lord,
==7==You know the goodness I intend upon you:
==8==Tell me but truly, but then speak the truth,
==9==Do you not love my sister?

**EDM.**
==9==              In honor’d love.

**REG.**
==10==But have you never found my brother’s way
==11==To the forfended place?

**EDM.**
==11==              That thought abuses you.

**REG.**
==12==I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
==13==And bosom’d with her—as far as we call hers.

**EDM.**
==14==No, by mine honor, madam.

**REG.**
==15==I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,
==16==Be not familiar with her.

**EDM.**
==16==              Fear me not.
==17==She and the Duke her husband!

*Enter, with Drum and Colors, Albany, Goneril, Soldiers.*

**GON.**
*(Aside.)*
==18==I had rather lose the battle than that sister
==19==Should loosen him and me.

**ALB.**
==20==Our very loving sister, well bemet.
==21==Sir, this I heard: the King is come to his daughter,
==22==With others whom the rigor of our state
==23==Forc’d to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
==24==I never yet was valiant. For this business,
==25==It touches us as France invades our land,
==26==Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,
==27==Most just and heavy causes make oppose.

**EDM.**
==28==Sir, you speak nobly.

**REG.**
==28==           Why is this reason’d?

**GON.**
==29==Combine together ’gainst the enemy;
==30==For these domestic and particular broils
==31==Are not the question here.

**ALB.**
==31==              Let’s then determine
==32==With th’ ancient of war on our proceeding.

**EDM.**
==33==I shall attend you presently at your tent.

**REG.**
==34==Sister, you’ll go with us?

**GON.**
==35==No.

**REG.**
==36==’Tis most convenient, pray go with us.

**GON.**
*(Aside.)*
==37==O ho, I know the riddle.—I will go.

*Exeunt both the armies.*

*As they are going out, enter Edgar disguised. Albany remains.*

**EDG.**
==38==If e’er your Grace had speech with man so poor,
==39==Hear me one word.

**ALB.**
==39==           I’ll overtake you.—Speak.

**EDG.**
==40==Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
==41==If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
==42==For him that brought it. Wretched though I seem,
==43==I can produce a champion that will prove
==44==What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
==45==Your business of the world hath so an end,
==46==And machination ceases. Fortune love you!

**ALB.**
==47==Stay till I have read the letter.

**EDG.**
==47==                I was forbid it.
==48==When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
==49==And I’ll appear again.

**ALB.**
==50==Why, fare thee well, I will o’erlook thy paper.

*Exit Edgar.*

*Enter Edmund.*

**EDM.**
==51==The enemy’s in view, draw up your powers.
==52==Here is the guess of their true strength and forces,
==53==By diligent discovery, but your haste
==54==Is now urg’d on you.

**ALB.**
==54==           We will greet the time.

*Exit.*

**EDM.**
==55==To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
==56==Each jealous of the other, as the stung
==57==Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
==58==Both? One? Or neither? Neither can be enjoy’d
==59==If both remain alive: to take the widow
==60==Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril,
==61==And hardly shall I carry out my side,
==62==Her husband being alive. Now then, we’ll use
==63==His countenance for the battle, which being done,
==64==Let her who would be rid of him devise
==65==His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
==66==Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
==67==The battle done, and they within our power,
==68==Shall never see his pardon; for my state
==69==Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

*Exit.*
