## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]]

*The British camp near Dover.*

*Enter in conquest, with Drum and Colors, Edmund, Lear and Cordelia as prisoners, Soldiers, Captain.*

**EDM.**
==1==Some officers take them away. Good guard,
==2==Until their greater pleasures first be known
==3==That are to censure them.

**COR.**
==3==              We are not the first
==4==Who with best meaning have incurr’d the worst.
==5==For thee, oppressed king, I am cast down,
==6==Myself could else out-frown false Fortune’s frown.
==7==Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

**LEAR.**
==8==No, no, no, no! Come let’s away to prison:
==9==We two alone will sing like birds i’ th’ cage;
==10==When thou dost ask me blessing, I’ll kneel down
==11==And ask of thee forgiveness. So we’ll live,
==12==And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
==13==At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
==14==Talk of court news; and we’ll talk with them too⁠—
==15==Who loses and who wins; who’s in, who’s out⁠—
==16==And take upon ’s the mystery of things
==17==As if we were God’s spies; and we’ll wear out,
==18==In a wall’d prison, packs and sects of great ones,
==19==That ebb and flow by th’ moon.

**EDM.**
==19==                  Take them away.

**LEAR.**
==20==Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
==21==The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
==22==He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
==23==And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
==24==The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
==25==Ere they shall make us weep! We’ll see ’em starv’d first.
==26==Come.

*Exit with Cordelia, guarded.*

**EDM.**
==26==    Come hither, captain; hark.
==27==Take thou this note
*(Giving a paper.)*
==27==           go follow them to prison.
==28==One step I have advanc’d thee; if thou dost
==29==As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
==30==To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men
==31==Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
==32==Does not become a sword. Thy great employment
==33==Will not bear question; either say thou’lt do’t,
==34==Or thrive by other means.

**1. CAPT.**
==34==              I’ll do’t, my lord.

**EDM.**
==35==About it, and write happy when th’ hast done.
==36==Mark, I say instantly, and carry it so
==37==As I have set it down.

**1. CAPT.**
==38==I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats,
==39==If it be man’s work, I’ll do’t.

*Exit First Captain.*

*Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, another Captain, Soldiers.*

**ALB.**
==40==Sir, you have show’d today your valiant strain,
==41==And fortune led you well. You have the captives
==42==Who were the opposites of this day’s strife;
==43==I do require them of you, so to use them
==44==As we shall find their merits and our safety
==45==May equally determine.

**EDM.**
==45==              Sir, I thought it fit
==46==To send the old and miserable King
==47==To some retention and appointed guard,
==48==Whose age had charms in it, whose title more,
==49==To pluck the common bosom on his side,
==50==And turn our impress’d lances in our eyes
==51==Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,
==52==My reason all the same, and they are ready
==53==Tomorrow, or at further space, t’ appear
==54==Where you shall hold your session. At this time
==55==We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend,
==56==And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs’d
==57==By those that feel their sharpness.
==58==The question of Cordelia and her father
==59==Requires a fitter place.

**ALB.**
==59==              Sir, by your patience,
==60==I hold you but a subject of this war,
==61==Not as a brother.

**REG.**
==61==        That’s as we list to grace him.
==62==Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
==63==Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
==64==Bore the commission of my place and person,
==65==The which immediacy may well stand up,
==66==And call itself your brother.

**GON.**
==66==              Not so hot.
==67==In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
==68==More than in your addition.

**REG.**
==68==              In my rights,
==69==By me invested, he compeers the best.

**GON.**
==70==That were the most, if he should husband you.

**REG.**
==71==Jesters do oft prove prophets.

**GON.**
==71==                Holla, holla!
==72==That eye that told you so look’d but a-squint.

**REG.**
==73==Lady, I am not well, else I should answer
==74==From a full-flowing stomach. General,
==75==Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
==76==Dispose of them, of me; the walls is thine.
==77==Witness the world, that I create thee here
==78==My lord and master.

**GON.**
==78==           Mean you to enjoy him?

**ALB.**
==79==The let-alone lies not in your good will.

**EDM.**
==80==Nor in thine, lord.

**ALB.**
==80==           Half-blooded fellow, yes.

**REG.**
*(To Edmund.)*
==81==Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.

**ALB.**
==82==Stay yet, hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
==83==On capital treason, and in thy attaint,
==84==This gilded serpent
*(Pointing to Goneril.)*
==84==           For your claim, fair sister,
==85==I bar it in the interest of my wife;
==86==’Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
==87==And I, her husband, contradict your banes.
==88==If you will marry, make your loves to me,
==89==My lady is bespoke.

**GON.**
==89==           An enterlude!

**ALB.**
==90==Thou art armed, Gloucester, let the trumpet sound.
==91==If none appear to prove upon thy person
==92==Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
==93==There is my pledge
*(Throwing down a glove.)*
==93==           I’ll make it on thy heart,
==94==Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
==95==Than I have here proclaim’d thee.

**REG.**
==95==                  Sick, O, sick!

**GON.**
*(Aside.)*
==96==If not, I’ll ne’er trust medicine.

**EDM.**
==97==There’s my exchange.
*(Throwing down a glove.)*
==97==           What in the world he is
==98==That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.
==99==Call by the trumpet; he that dares approach:
==100==On him, on you—who not?—I will maintain
==101==My truth and honor firmly.

**ALB.**
==102==A herald, ho!

**EDM.**
==102==        A herald, ho, a herald!

**ALB.**
==103==Trust to thy single virtue, for thy soldiers,
==104==All levied in my name, have in my name
==105==Took their discharge.

**REG.**
==105==           My sickness grows upon me.

**ALB.**
==106==She is not well, convey her to my tent.
*(Exit Regan, led.)*
*(Enter a Herald.)*
==107==Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,
==108==And read out this.

**2. CAPT.**
==109==Sound, trumpet!

*A trumpet sounds.*

**HER.**
*(Reads.)*
==110==*“If any man of quality or degree within the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the trumpet. He is bold in his defense.”*

**EDM.**
==111==Sound!

*First trumpet.*

**HER.**
==112==Again!

*Second trumpet.*

**HER.**
==113==Again!

*Third trumpet.*

*Trumpet answers within.*

*Enter Edgar disguised at the third sound, armed, a Trumpet before him.*

**ALB.**
==114==Ask him his purposes, why he appears
==115==Upon this call o’ th’ trumpet.

**HER.**
==115==                What are you?
==116==Your name, your quality? And why you answer
==117==This present summons?

**EDG.**
==117==              Know, my name is lost,
==118==By treason’s tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit,
==119==Yet am I noble as the adversary
==120==I come to cope.

**ALB.**
==120==        Which is that adversary?

**EDG.**
==121==What’s he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?

**EDM.**
==122==Himself; what say’st thou to him?

**EDG.**
==122==                  Draw thy sword,
==123==That if my speech offend a noble heart,
==124==Thy arm may do thee justice; here is mine:
==125==Behold, it is my privilege,
==126==The privilege of mine honors,
==127==My oath, and my profession. I protest,
==128==Maugre thy strength, place, youth, and eminence,
==129==Despite thy victor-sword and fire-new fortune,
==130==Thy valor, and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
==131==False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father,
==132==Conspirant ’gainst this high illustrious prince,
==133==And from th’ extremest upward of thy head
==134==To the descent and dust below thy foot,
==135==A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou “No,”
==136==This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent
==137==To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
==138==Thou liest.

**EDM.**
==138==    In wisdom I should ask thy name,
==139==But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
==140==And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
==141==What safe and nicely I might well delay
==142==By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.
==143==Back do I toss these treasons to thy head,
==144==With the hell-hated lie o’erwhelm thy heart,
==145==Which for they yet glance by, and scarcely bruise,
==146==This sword of mine shall give them instant way
==147==Where they shall rest forever. Trumpets, speak!

*Alarums. They fight. Edmund falls.*

**ALB.**
==148==Save him, save him!

**GON.**
==148==           This is practice, Gloucester.
==149==By th’ law of war thou wast not bound to answer
==150==An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish’d,
==151==But cozen’d and beguil’d.

**ALB.**
==151==              Shut your mouth, dame,
==152==Or with this paper shall I stopple it. Hold, sir.⁠—
==153==Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil.
==154==No tearing, lady, I perceive you know it.

**GON.**
==155==Say if I do, the laws are mine, not thine;
==156==Who can arraign me for’t?

**ALB.**
==156==              Most monstrous! O!
==157==Know’st thou this paper?

**GON.**
==157==              Ask me not what I know.

*Exit.*

**ALB.**
==158==Go after her; she’s desperate, govern her.

**EDM.**
==159==What you have charg’d me with, that have I done,
==160==And more, much more, the time will bring it out.
==161==’Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
==162==That hast this fortune on me? If thou’rt noble,
==163==I do forgive thee.

**EDG.**
==163==           Let’s exchange charity.
==164==I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
==165==If more, the more th’ hast wrong’d me.
==166==My name is Edgar, and thy father’s son.
==167==The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
==168==Make instruments to plague us:
==169==The dark and vicious place where thee he got
==170==Cost him his eyes.

**EDM.**
==170==           th’ hast spoken right, ’tis true.
==171==The wheel is come full circle, I am here.

**ALB.**
==172==Methought thy very gait did prophesy
==173==A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.
==174==Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
==175==Did hate thee or thy father.

**EDG.**
==175==              Worthy prince, I know’t.

**ALB.**
==176==Where have you hid yourself?
==177==How have you known the miseries of your father?

**EDG.**
==178==By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale,
==179==And when ’tis told, O that my heart would burst!
==180==The bloody proclamation to escape,
==181==That follow’d me so near (O, our lives’ sweetness!
==182==That we the pain of death would hourly die
==183==Rather than die at once!), taught me to shift
==184==Into a madman’s rags, t’ assume a semblance
==185==That very dogs disdain’d; and in this habit
==186==Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
==187==Their precious stones new lost; became his guide,
==188==Led him, begg’d for him, sav’d him from despair;
==189==Never (O fault!) reveal’d myself unto him,
==190==Until some half hour past, when I was arm’d.
==191==Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
==192==I ask’d his blessing, and from first to last
==193==Told him our pilgrimage. But his flaw’d heart
==194==(Alack, too weak the conflict to support!) 
==195==’Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
==196==Burst smilingly.

**EDM.**
==196==        This speech of yours hath mov’d me,
==197==And shall perchance do good: but speak you on,
==198==You look as you had something more to say.

**ALB.**
==199==If there be more, more woeful, hold it in,
==200==For I am almost ready to dissolve,
==201==Hearing of this.

**EDG.**
==201==        This would have seem’d a period
==202==To such as love not sorrow, but another,
==203==To amplify too much, would make much more,
==204==And top extremity. Whilst I
==205==Was big in clamor, came there in a man,
==206==Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
==207==Shunn’d my abhorr’d society, but then finding
==208==Who ’twas that so endur’d, with his strong arms
==209==He fastened on my neck and bellowed out
==210==As he’d burst heaven, threw him on my father,
==211==Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
==212==That ever ear received, which in recounting,
==213==His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
==214==Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,
==215==And there I left him tranc’d.

**ALB.**
==215==                But who was this?

**EDG.**
==216==Kent, sir, the banish’d Kent, who in disguise
==217==Followed his enemy king, and did him service
==218==Improper for a slave.

*Enter Second Gentleman with a bloody knife.*

**2. GENT.**
==219==Help, help! O, help!

**EDG.**
==219==           What kind of help?

**ALB.**
==219==                     Speak, man.

**EDG.**
==220==What means this bloody knife?

**2. GENT.**
==220==                  ’Tis hot, it smokes,
==221==It came even from the heart of—O, she’s dead!

**ALB.**
==222==Who dead? Speak, man.

**2. GENT.**
==223==Your lady, sir, your lady; and her sister
==224==By her is poison’d; she confesses it.

**EDM.**
==225==I was contracted to them both; all three
==226==Now marry in an instant.

**EDG.**
==226==              Here comes Kent.

*Enter Kent.*

**ALB.**
==227==Produce the bodies, be they alive or dead.
*(Exit Second Gentleman.)*
==228==This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
==229==Touches us not with pity.—O, is this he?
==230==The time will not allow the compliment
==231==Which very manners urges.

**KENT.**
==231==                I am come
==232==To bid my king and master aye good night.
==233==Is he not here?

**ALB.**
==233==        Great thing of us forgot!
==234==Speak, Edmund, where’s the King? And where’s Cordelia?
*(Goneril and Regan’s bodies brought out.)*
==235==Seest thou this object, Kent?

**KENT.**
==236==Alack, why thus?

**EDM.**
==236==           Yet Edmund was belov’d!
==237==The one the other poison’d for my sake,
==238==And after slew herself.

**ALB.**
==239==Even so. Cover their faces.

**EDM.**
==240==I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,
==241==Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
==242==(Be brief in it) to th’ castle, for my writ
==243==Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.
==244==Nay, send in time.

**ALB.**
==244==           Run, run, O, run!

**EDG.**
==245==To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send
==246==Thy token of reprieve.

**EDM.**
==247==Well thought on. Take my sword. The captain⁠—
==248==Give it the captain.

**ALB.**
==248==           Haste thee, for thy life.

*Exit Edgar.*

**EDM.**
==249==He hath commission from thy wife and me
==250==To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
==251==To lay the blame upon her own despair,
==252==That she fordid herself.

**ALB.**
==253==The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.

*Edmund is borne off.*

*Enter Lear with Cordelia in his arms, Edgar and Second Gentleman following.*

**LEAR.**
==254==Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones!
==255==Had I your tongues and eyes, I’ld use them so
==256==That heaven’s vault should crack. She’s gone forever!
==257==I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
==258==She’s dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass,
==259==If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
==260==Why then she lives.

**KENT.**
==260==           Is this the promis’d end?

**EDG.**
==261==Or image of that horror?

**ALB.**
==261==              Fall, and cease!

**LEAR.**
==262==This feather stirs, she lives! If it be so,
==263==It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
==264==That ever I have felt.

**KENT.**
*(Kneeling.)*
==264==           O my good master!

**LEAR.**
==265==Prithee away.

**EDG.**
==265==        ’Tis noble Kent, your friend.

**LEAR.**
==266==A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
==267==I might have sav’d her, now she’s gone forever!
==268==Cordelia, Cordelia, stay a little. Ha!
==269==What is’t thou say’st? Her voice was ever soft,
==270==Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
==271==I kill’d the slave that was a-hanging thee.

**2. GENT.**
==272==’Tis true, my lords, he did.

**LEAR.**
==272==              Did I not, fellow?
==273==I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
==274==I would have made them skip. I am old now,
==275==And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
==276==Mine eyes are not o’ th’ best; I’ll tell you straight.

**KENT.**
==277==If Fortune brag of two she lov’d and hated,
==278==One of them we behold.

**LEAR.**
==279==This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

**KENT.**
==279==                     The same:
==280==Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?

**LEAR.**
==281==He’s a good fellow, I can tell you that;
==282==He’ll strike, and quickly too. He’s dead and rotten.

**KENT.**
==283==No, my good lord, I am the very man⁠—

**LEAR.**
==284==I’ll see that straight.

**KENT.**
==285==That from your first of difference and decay,
==286==Have follow’d your sad steps⁠—

**LEAR.**
==286==                You are welcome hither.

**KENT.**
==287==Nor no man else. All’s cheerless, dark, and deadly.
==288==Your eldest daughters have foredone themselves,
==289==And desperately are dead.

**LEAR.**
==289==              Ay, so I think.

**ALB.**
==290==He knows not what he says, and vain is it
==291==That we present us to him.

**EDG.**
==291==              Very bootless.

*Enter Second Messenger.*

**2. MESS.**
==292==Edmund is dead, my lord.

**ALB.**
==292==              That’s but a trifle here.
==293==You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
==294==What comfort to this great decay may come
==295==Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,
==296==During the life of this old majesty,
==297==To him our absolute power.
*(To Edgar and Kent.)*
==297==                You, to your rights,
==298==With boot, and such addition as your honors
==299==Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
==300==The wages of their virtue, and all foes
==301==The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!

**LEAR.**
==302==And my poor fool is hang’d! No, no, no life!
==303==Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
==304==And thou no breath at all? Thou’lt come no more,
==305==Never, never, never, never, never.
==306==Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.
==307==Do you see this? Look on her! Look her lips,
==308==Look there, look there!

*He dies.*

**EDG.**
==308==              He faints. My lord, my lord!

**KENT.**
==309==Break, heart, I prithee break!

**EDG.**
==309==                Look up, my lord.

**KENT.**
==310==Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass, he hates him
==311==That would upon the rack of this tough world
==312==Stretch him out longer.

**EDG.**
==312==              He is gone indeed.

**KENT.**
==313==The wonder is he hath endur’d so long,
==314==He but usurp’d his life.

**ALB.**
==315==Bear them from hence. Our present business
==316==Is general woe.
*(To Kent and Edgar.)*
==316==        Friends of my soul, you twain
==317==Rule in this realm, and the gor’d state sustain.

**KENT.**
==318==I have a journey, sir, shortly to go:
==319==My master calls me, I must not say no.

**EDG.**
==320==The weight of this sad time we must obey,
==321==Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say:
==322==The oldest hath borne most; we that are young
==323==Shall never see so much, nor live so long.

*Exeunt with a dead march.*
