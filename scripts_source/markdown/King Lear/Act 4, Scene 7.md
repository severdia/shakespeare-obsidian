## Act 4, Scene 7
[[Act 4, Scene 6|← Act 4, Scene 6]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*The French camp near Dover. A tent.*

*Enter Cordelia, Kent still dressed as Caius, and Doctor.*

**COR.**
==1==O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work
==2==To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
==3==And every measure fail me.

**KENT.**
==4==To be acknowledg’d, madam, is o’erpaid.
==5==All my reports go with the modest truth,
==6==Nor more nor clipt, but so.

**COR.**
==6==              Be better suited,
==7==These weeds are memories of those worser hours;
==8==I prithee put them off.

**KENT.**
==8==              Pardon, dear madam,
==9==Yet to be known shortens my made intent.
==10==My boon I make it, that you know me not
==11==Till time and I think meet.

**COR.**
==12==Then be’t so, my good lord.
*(To the Doctor.)*
==13==How does the King?

**DOCT.**
==13==           Madam, sleeps still.

**COR.**
==13==                     O you kind gods!
==14==Cure this great breach in his abused nature,
==15==Th’ untun’d and jarring senses, O, wind up
==16==Of this child-changed father!

**DOCT.**
==16==                So please your Majesty
==17==That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.

**COR.**
==18==Be govern’d by your knowledge, and proceed
==19==I’ th’ sway of your own will. Is he array’d?

**1. GENT.**
==20==Ay, madam; in the heaviness of sleep
==21==We put fresh garments on him.

**DOCT.**
==22==Be by, good madam, when we do awake him,
==23==I doubt not of his temperance.

**COR.**
==23==                  Very well.

*Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants. First Gentleman in attendance. Soft music.*

**DOCT.**
==24==Please you draw near.—Louder the music there!

**COR.**
==25==O my dear father, restoration hang
==26==Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss
==27==Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
==28==Have in thy reverence made.

**KENT.**
==29==Kind and dear princess!

**COR.**
==30==Had you not been their father, these white flakes
==31==Did challenge pity of them. Was this a face
==32==To be oppos’d against the warring winds?
==33==To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
==34==In the most terrible and nimble stroke
==35==Of quick cross lightning? To watch—poor *perdu*!⁠—
==36==With this thin helm? Mine enemy’s dog,
==37==Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
==38==Against my fire, and wast thou fain, poor father,
==39==To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn
==40==In short and musty straw? Alack, alack,
==41==’Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
==42==Had not concluded all. He wakes, speak to him.

**DOCT.**
==43==Madam, do you, ’tis fittest.

**COR.**
==44==How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?

**LEAR.**
==45==You do me wrong to take me out o’ th’ grave:
==46==Thou art a soul in bliss, but I am bound
==47==Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
==48==Do scald like molten lead.

**COR.**
==48==              Sir, do you know me?

**LEAR.**
==49==You are a spirit, I know; when did you die?

**COR.**
==50==Still, still, far wide!

**DOCT.**
==51==He’s scarce awake, let him alone a while.

**LEAR.**
==52==Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
==53==I am mightily abus’d; I should ev’n die with pity
==54==To see another thus. I know not what to say.
==55==I will not swear these are my hands. Let’s see,
==56==I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur’d
==57==Of my condition!

**COR.**
==57==           O, look upon me, sir,
==58==And hold your hand in benediction o’er me.
==59==No, sir, you must not kneel.

**LEAR.**
==59==                Pray do not mock me.
==60==I am a very foolish fond old man,
==61==Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
==62==And to deal plainly,
==63==I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
==64==Methinks I should know you, and know this man,
==65==Yet I am doubtful: for I am mainly ignorant
==66==What place this is, and all the skill I have
==67==Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
==68==Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me,
==69==For (as I am a man) I think this lady
==70==To be my child Cordelia.

**COR.**
==70==              And so I am; I am.

**LEAR.**
==71==Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.
==72==If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
==73==I know you do not love me, for your sisters
==74==Have (as I do remember) done me wrong:
==75==You have some cause, they have not.

**COR.**
==75==                  No cause, no cause.

**LEAR.**
==76==Am I in France?

**KENT.**
==76==           In your own kingdom, sir.

**LEAR.**
==77==Do not abuse me.

**DOCT.**
==78==Be comforted, good madam, the great rage,
==79==You see, is kill’d in him, and yet it is danger
==80==To make him even o’er the time he has lost.
==81==Desire him to go in, trouble him no more
==82==Till further settling.

**COR.**
==83==Will’t please your Highness walk?

**LEAR.**
==83==                  You must bear with me.
==84==Pray you now forget, and forgive; I am old and foolish.

*Exeunt. Manent Kent and First Gentleman.*

**1. GENT.**
==85==Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?

**KENT.**
==86==Most certain, sir.

**1. GENT.**
==87==Who is conductor of his people?

**KENT.**
==88==As ’tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.

**1. GENT.**
==89==They say Edgar, his banish’d son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.

**KENT.**
==90==Report is changeable. ’Tis time to look about, the powers of the kingdom approach apace.

**1. GENT.**
==91==The arbiterment is like to be bloody. Fare you well, sir.

*Exit.*

**KENT.**
==92==My point and period will be throughly wrought,
==93==Or well or ill, as this day’s battle’s fought.

*Exit.*
