## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*The French camp near Dover. A tent.*

*Enter, with Drum and Colors, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers.*

**COR.**
==1== Alack, ’tis he! Why, he was met even now
==2== As mad as the vex’d sea, singing aloud,
==3== Crown’d with rank fumitor and furrow-weeds,
==4== With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flow’rs,
==5== Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
==6== In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
==7== Search every acre in the high-grown field,
==8== And bring him to our eye.
*(Exit an Officer.)*
==8==               What can man’s wisdom
==9== In the restoring his bereaved sense?
==10== He that helps him take all my outward worth.

**DOCT.**
==11== There is means, madam.
==12== Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
==13== The which he lacks; that to provoke in him
==14== Are many simples operative, whose power
==15== Will close the eye of anguish.

**COR.**
==15==                 All blest secrets,
==16== All you unpublish’d virtues of the earth,
==17== Spring with my tears; be aidant and remediate
==18== In the good man’s distress! Seek, seek for him,
==19== Lest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life
==20== That wants the means to lead it.

*Enter French Messenger.*

**FR. MESS.**
==20==                   News, madam!
==21== The British pow’rs are marching hitherward.

**COR.**
==22== ’Tis known before; our preparation stands
==23== In expectation of them. O dear father,
==24== It is thy business that I go about;
==25== Therefore great France
==26== My mourning and importun’d tears hath pitied.
==27== No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
==28== But love, dear love, and our ag’d father’s right.
==29== Soon may I hear and see him!

*Exeunt.*
