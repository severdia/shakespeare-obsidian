## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*The French camp near Dover. A tent.*

*Enter, with Drum and Colors, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers.*

**COR.**
Alack, ’tis he! Why, he was met even now
As mad as the vex’d sea, singing aloud,
Crown’d with rank fumitor and furrow-weeds,
With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flow’rs,
Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
Search every acre in the high-grown field,
And bring him to our eye.
*(Exit an Officer.)*
              What can man’s wisdom
In the restoring his bereaved sense?
He that helps him take all my outward worth.

**DOCT.**
There is means, madam.
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
The which he lacks; that to provoke in him
Are many simples operative, whose power
Will close the eye of anguish.

**COR.**
                All blest secrets,
All you unpublish’d virtues of the earth,
Spring with my tears; be aidant and remediate
In the good man’s distress! Seek, seek for him,
Lest his ungovern’d rage dissolve the life
That wants the means to lead it.

*Enter French Messenger.*

**FR. MESS.**
                  News, madam!
The British pow’rs are marching hitherward.

**COR.**
’Tis known before; our preparation stands
In expectation of them. O dear father,
It is thy business that I go about;
Therefore great France
My mourning and importun’d tears hath pitied.
No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
But love, dear love, and our ag’d father’s right.
Soon may I hear and see him!

*Exeunt.*
