## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 7|← Act 3, Scene 7]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*A heath.*

*Enter Edgar.*

**EDG.**
==1== Yet better thus, and known to be contemn’d,
==2== Than still contemn’d and flatter’d. To be worst,
==3== The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
==4== Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.
==5== The lamentable change is from the best,
==6== The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,
==7== Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace:
==8== The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
==9== Owes nothing to thy blasts.
*(Enter Gloucester led by an Old Man.)*
==9==               But who comes here?
==10== My father, parti-ey’d? World, world, O world!
==11== But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
==12== Life would not yield to age.

**OLD MAN.**
==12==                 O my good lord,
==13== I have been your tenant, and your father’s tenant,
==14== These fourscore years.

**GLOU.**
==15== Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone,
==16== Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
==17== Thee they may hurt.

**OLD MAN.**
==17==            You cannot see your way.

**GLOU.**
==18== I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
==19== I stumbled when I saw. Full oft ’tis seen,
==20== Our means secure us, and our mere defects
==21== Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
==22== The food of thy abused father’s wrath!
==23== Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
==24== I’ld say I had eyes again.

**OLD MAN.**
==24==               How now? Who’s there?

**EDG.**
*(Aside.)*
==25== O gods! Who is’t can say, “I am at the worst”?
==26== I am worse than e’er I was.

**OLD MAN.**
==26==               ’Tis poor mad Tom.

**EDG.**
*(Aside.)*
==27== And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
==28== So long as we can say, “This is the worst.”

**OLD MAN.**
==29== Fellow, where goest?

**GLOU.**
==29==            Is it a beggar-man?

**OLD MAN.**
==30== Madman and beggar too.

**GLOU.**
==31== He has some reason, else he could not beg.
==32== I’ th’ last night’s storm I such a fellow saw,
==33== Which made me think a man a worm. My son
==34== Came then into my mind, and yet my mind
==35== Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.
==36== As flies to wanton boys are we to th’ gods,
==37== They kill us for their sport.

**EDG.**
*(Aside.)*
==37==               How should this be?
==38== Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
==39== Ang’ring itself and others.—Bless thee, master!

**GLOU.**
==40== Is that the naked fellow?

**OLD MAN.**
==40==               Ay, my lord.

**GLOU.**
==41== Then prithee get thee away. If for my sake
==42== Thou wilt o’ertake us hence a mile or twain
==43== I’ th’ way toward Dover, do it for ancient love,
==44== And bring some covering for this naked soul,
==45== Which I’ll entreat to lead me.

**OLD MAN.**
==45==                 Alack, sir, he is mad.

**GLOU.**
==46== ’Tis the time’s plague, when madmen lead the blind.
==47== Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
==48== Above the rest, be gone.

**OLD MAN.**
==49== I’ll bring him the best ’parel that I have,
==50== Come on’t what will.

*Exit.*

**GLOU.**
==51== Sirrah, naked fellow⁠—

**EDG.**
==52== Poor Tom’s a-cold.
*(Aside.)*
==52==            I cannot daub it further.

**GLOU.**
==53== Come hither, fellow.

**EDG.**
*(Aside.)*
==54== And yet I must.—Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.

**GLOU.**
==55== Know’st thou the way to Dover?

**EDG.**
==56== Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor Tom hath been scar’d out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man’s son, from the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!

**GLOU.**
==57== Here, take this purse, thou whom the heav’ns’ plagues
==58== Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched
==59== Makes thee the happier; heavens, deal so still!
==60== Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
==61== That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
==62== Because he does not feel, feel your pow’r quickly;
==63== So distribution should undo excess,
==64== And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?

**EDG.**
==65== Ay, master.

**GLOU.**
==66== There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
==67== Looks fearfully in the confined deep.
==68== Bring me but to the very brim of it,
==69== And I’ll repair the misery thou dost bear
==70== With something rich about me. From that place
==71== I shall no leading need.

**EDG.**
==71==               Give me thy arm;
==72== Poor Tom shall lead thee.

*Exeunt.*
