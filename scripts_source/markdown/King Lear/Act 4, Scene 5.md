## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Gloucester’s castle.*

*Enter Regan and Steward Oswald.*

**REG.**
But are my brother’s pow’rs set forth?

**OSW.**
                     Ay, madam.

**REG.**
Himself in person there?

**OSW.**
              Madam, with much ado;
Your sister is the better soldier.

**REG.**
Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

**OSW.**
No, madam.

**REG.**
What might import my sister’s letter to him?

**OSW.**
I know not, lady.

**REG.**
Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,
To let him live; where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
In pity of his misery, to dispatch
His nighted life; moreover to descry
The strength o’ th’ enemy.

**OSW.**
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

**REG.**
Our troops set forth tomorrow, stay with us;
The ways are dangerous.

**OSW.**
              I may not, madam;
My lady charg’d my duty in this business.

**REG.**
Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
Transport her purposes by word? Belike
Some things—I know not what. I’ll love thee much⁠—
Let me unseal the letter.

**OSW.**
              Madam, I had rather⁠—

**REG.**
I know your lady does not love her husband,
I am sure of that; and at her late being here
She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.

**OSW.**
I, madam?

**REG.**
I speak in understanding: y’ are; I know’t.
Therefore I do advise you take this note:
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk’d,
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your lady’s. You may gather more.
If you do find him, pray you give him this;
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.
So fare you well.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

**OSW.**
Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
What party I do follow.

**REG.**
              Fare thee well.

*Exeunt.*
