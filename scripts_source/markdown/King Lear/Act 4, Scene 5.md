## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Gloucester’s castle.*

*Enter Regan and Steward Oswald.*

**REG.**
==1==But are my brother’s pow’rs set forth?

**OSW.**
==1==                     Ay, madam.

**REG.**
==2==Himself in person there?

**OSW.**
==2==              Madam, with much ado;
==3==Your sister is the better soldier.

**REG.**
==4==Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

**OSW.**
==5==No, madam.

**REG.**
==6==What might import my sister’s letter to him?

**OSW.**
==7==I know not, lady.

**REG.**
==8==Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
==9==It was great ignorance, Gloucester’s eyes being out,
==10==To let him live; where he arrives he moves
==11==All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
==12==In pity of his misery, to dispatch
==13==His nighted life; moreover to descry
==14==The strength o’ th’ enemy.

**OSW.**
==15==I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

**REG.**
==16==Our troops set forth tomorrow, stay with us;
==17==The ways are dangerous.

**OSW.**
==17==              I may not, madam;
==18==My lady charg’d my duty in this business.

**REG.**
==19==Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
==20==Transport her purposes by word? Belike
==21==Some things—I know not what. I’ll love thee much⁠—
==22==Let me unseal the letter.

**OSW.**
==22==              Madam, I had rather⁠—

**REG.**
==23==I know your lady does not love her husband,
==24==I am sure of that; and at her late being here
==25==She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks
==26==To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.

**OSW.**
==27==I, madam?

**REG.**
==28==I speak in understanding: y’ are; I know’t.
==29==Therefore I do advise you take this note:
==30==My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk’d,
==31==And more convenient is he for my hand
==32==Than for your lady’s. You may gather more.
==33==If you do find him, pray you give him this;
==34==And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
==35==I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.
==36==So fare you well.
==37==If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
==38==Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

**OSW.**
==39==Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
==40==What party I do follow.

**REG.**
==40==              Fare thee well.

*Exeunt.*
