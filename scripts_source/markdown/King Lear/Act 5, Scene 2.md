*Enter Edgar and Gloucester.*

**EDG.**
==1==Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
==2==For your good host; pray that the right may thrive.
==3==If ever I return to you again,
==4==I’ll bring you comfort.

**GLOU.**
==4==           Grace go with you, sir!

*Exit Edgar.*

==5==Away, old man, give me thy hand, away!
==6==King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta’en.
==7==Give me thy hand; come on.

**GLOU.**
==8==No further, sir, a man may rot even here.

**EDG.**
==9==What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
==10==Their going hence even as their coming hither,
==11==Ripeness is all. Come on.

**GLOU.**
==11==              And that’s true too.

*Exeunt.*
