## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The battlefield between the two camps.*

*Alarum within. Enter, with Drum and Colors, the Powers of France over the stage, Cordelia with her Father in her hand, and exeunt.*

*Enter Edgar and Gloucester.*

**EDG.**
Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
For your good host; pray that the right may thrive.
If ever I return to you again,
I’ll bring you comfort.

**GLOU.**
           Grace go with you, sir!

*Exit Edgar.*

*Alarum and retreat within.*

*Enter Edgar.*

**EDG.**
Away, old man, give me thy hand, away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta’en.
Give me thy hand; come on.

**GLOU.**
No further, sir, a man may rot even here.

**EDG.**
What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Their going hence even as their coming hither,
Ripeness is all. Come on.

**GLOU.**
              And that’s true too.

*Exeunt.*
