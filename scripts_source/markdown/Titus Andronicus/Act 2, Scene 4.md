## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the forest.*

*Enter the Empress’ sons (Demetrius and Chiron) with Lavinia, her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out, and ravished.*

**DEM.**
==1==So now go tell, and if thy tongue can speak,
==2==Who ’twas that cut thy tongue and ravish’d thee.

**CHI.**
==3==Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
==4==And if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.

**DEM.**
==5==See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.

**CHI.**
==6==Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.

**DEM.**
==7==She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash,
==8==And so let’s leave her to her silent walks.

**CHI.**
==9==And ’twere my cause, I should go hang myself.

**DEM.**
==10==If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.

*Exeunt Demetrius and Chiron.*

*Wind horns. Enter Marcus from hunting.*

**MARC.**
==11==Who is this? My niece, that flies away so fast?
==12==Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
==13==If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
==14==If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
==15==That I may slumber an eternal sleep!
==16==Speak, gentle niece: what stern ungentle hands
==17==Hath lopp’d and hew’d, and made thy body bare
==18==Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments
==19==Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
==20==And might not gain so great a happiness
==21==As half thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
==22==Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
==23==Like to a bubbling fountain stirr’d with wind,
==24==Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
==25==Coming and going with thy honey breath.
==26==But sure some Tereus hath deflow’red thee,
==27==And lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
==28==Ah, now thou turn’st away thy face for shame!
==29==And notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
==30==As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
==31==Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan’s face
==32==Blushing to be encount’red with a cloud.
==33==Shall I speak for thee? Shall I say ’tis so?
==34==O that I knew thy heart, and knew the beast,
==35==That I might rail at him to ease my mind!
==36==Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp’d,
==37==Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
==38==Fair Philomela, why, she but lost her tongue,
==39==And in a tedious sampler sew’d her mind;
==40==But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee.
==41==A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
==42==And he hath cut those pretty fingers off
==43==That could have better sew’d than Philomel.
==44==O, had the monster seen those lily hands
==45==Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute,
==46==And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
==47==He would not then have touch’d them for his life!
==48==Or had he heard the heavenly harmony
==49==Which that sweet tongue hath made,
==50==He would have dropp’d his knife, and fell asleep,
==51==As Cerberus at the Thracian poet’s feet.
==52==Come let us go, and make thy father blind,
==53==For such a sight will blind a father’s eye.
==54==One hour’s storm will drown the fragrant meads,
==55==What will whole months of tears thy father’s eyes?
==56==Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee.
==57==O, could our mourning ease thy misery!

*Exeunt.*
