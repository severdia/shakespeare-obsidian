## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Rome. A room in the palace.*

*Enter Aaron, Chiron, and Demetrius at one door; and at the other door Young Lucius and another with a bundle of weapons, and verses writ upon them.*

**CHI.**
==1==Demetrius, here’s the son of Lucius,
==2==He hath some message to deliver us.

**AAR.**
==3==Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.

**Y. LUC.**
==4==My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
==5==I greet your honors from Andronicus⁠—
*(Aside.)*
==6==And pray the Roman gods confound you both!

**DEM.**
==7==Gramercy, lovely Lucius. What’s the news?

**Y. LUC.**
*(Aside.)*
==8==That you are both decipher’d, that’s the news,
==9==For villains mark’d with rape.—May it please you,
==10==My grandsire, well advis’d, hath sent by me
==11==The goodliest weapons of his armory
==12==To gratify your honorable youth,
==13==The hope of Rome, for so he bid me say;
==14==And so I do, and with his gifts present
==15==Your lordships, that, when ever you have need,
==16==You may be armed and appointed well:
==17==And so I leave you both⁠—
*(Aside.)*
==17==              like bloody villains.

*Exit with Attendant.*

**DEM.**
==18==What’s here? A scroll, and written round about.
==19==Let’s see:
*(Reads.)*
==20==*“Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,*
==21==*Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.”*

**CHI.**
==22==O, ’tis a verse in Horace, I know it well,
==23==I read it in the grammar long ago.

**AAR.**
==24==Ay, just—a verse in Horace, right, you have it.
*(Aside.)*
==25==Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
==26==Here’s no sound jest! The old man hath found their guilt,
==27==And sends them weapons wrapp’d about with lines
==28==That wound beyond their feeling to the quick.
==29==But were our witty Empress well afoot,
==30==She would applaud Andronicus’ conceit,
==31==But let her rest in her unrest a while.⁠—
==32==And now, young lords, was’t not a happy star
==33==Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
==34==Captives, to be advanced to this height?
==35==It did me good, before the palace gate
==36==To brave the tribune in his brother’s hearing.

**DEM.**
==37==But me more good to see so great a lord
==38==Basely insinuate and send us gifts.

**AAR.**
==39==Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
==40==Did you not use his daughter very friendly?

**DEM.**
==41==I would we had a thousand Roman dames
==42==At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.

**CHI.**
==43==A charitable wish, and full of love.

**AAR.**
==44==Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.

**CHI.**
==45==And that would she for twenty thousand more.

**DEM.**
==46==Come let us go and pray to all the gods
==47==For our beloved mother in her pains.

**AAR.**
*(Aside.)*
==48==Pray to the devils, the gods have given us over.

*Trumpets sound within.*

**DEM.**
==49==Why do the Emperor’s trumpets flourish thus?

**CHI.**
==50==Belike for joy the Emperor hath a son.

**DEM.**
==51==Soft, who comes here?

*Enter Nurse with a blackamoor child.*

**NUR.**
==51==              Good morrow, lords.
==52==O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?

**AAR.**
==53==Well, more or less, or ne’er a whit at all,
==54==Here Aaron is, and what with Aaron now?

**NUR.**
==55==O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
==56==Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!

**AAR.**
==57==Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
==58==What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms?

**NUR.**
==59==O, that which I would hide from heaven’s eye,
==60==Our Empress’ shame, and stately Rome’s disgrace!
==61==She is delivered, lords, she is delivered.

**AAR.**
==62==To whom?

**NUR.**
==62==        I mean she is brought a-bed.

**AAR.**
==63==Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?

**NUR.**
==64==A devil.

**AAR.**
==65==Why, then she is the devil’s dam: a joyful issue.

**NUR.**
==66==A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue!
==67==Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
==68==Amongst the fair-fac’d breeders of our clime.
==69==The Empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
==70==And bids thee christen it with thy dagger’s point.

**AAR.**
==71==’Zounds, ye whore, is black so base a hue?
==72==Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom sure.

**DEM.**
==73==Villain, what hast thou done?

**AAR.**
==74==That which thou canst not undo.

**CHI.**
==75==Thou hast undone our mother.

**AAR.**
==76==Villain, I have done thy mother.

**DEM.**
==77==And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone her.
==78==Woe to her chance, and damn’d her loathed choice!
==79==Accurs’d the offspring of so foul a fiend!

**CHI.**
==80==It shall not live.

**AAR.**
==81==It shall not die.

**NUR.**
==82==Aaron, it must, the mother wills it so.

**AAR.**
==83==What, must it, nurse? Then let no man but I
==84==Do execution on my flesh and blood.

**DEM.**
==85==I’ll broach the tadpole on my rapier’s point.
==86==Nurse, give it me, my sword shall soon dispatch it.

**AAR.**
==87==Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
*(Takes the child from the Nurse, and draws.)*
==88==Stay, murderous villains, will you kill your brother?
==89==Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
==90==That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
==91==He dies upon my scimitar’s sharp point,
==92==That touches this my first-born son and heir!
==93==I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
==94==With all his threat’ning band of Typhon’s brood,
==95==Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
==96==Shall seize this prey out of his father’s hands.
==97==What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
==98==Ye white-lim’d walls! Ye alehouse painted signs!
==99==Coal-black is better than another hue,
==100==In that it scorns to bear another hue;
==101==For all the water in the ocean
==102==Can never turn the swan’s black legs to white,
==103==Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
==104==Tell the Empress from me, I am of age
==105==To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.

**DEM.**
==106==Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?

**AAR.**
==107==My mistress is my mistress, this myself,
==108==The vigor and the picture of my youth:
==109==This before all the world do I prefer,
==110==This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
==111==Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.

**DEM.**
==112==By this our mother is forever sham’d.

**CHI.**
==113==Rome will despise her for this foul escape.

**NUR.**
==114==The Emperor in his rage will doom her death.

**CHI.**
==115==I blush to think upon this ignomy.

**AAR.**
==116==Why, there’s the privilege your beauty bears.
==117==Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
==118==The close enacts and counsels of thy heart!
==119==Here’s a young lad fram’d of another leer:
==120==Look how the black slave smiles upon the father,
==121==As who should say, “Old lad, I am thine own.”
==122==He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
==123==Of that self blood that first gave life to you,
==124==And from your womb where you imprisoned were
==125==He is enfranchised and come to light.
==126==Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
==127==Although my seal be stamped in his face.

**NUR.**
==128==Aaron, what shall I say unto the Empress?

**DEM.**
==129==Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
==130==And we will all subscribe to thy advice:
==131==Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.

**AAR.**
==132==Then sit we down and let us all consult.
==133==My son and I will have the wind of you;
==134==Keep there. Now talk at pleasure of your safety.

*They sit.*

**DEM.**
==135==How many women saw this child of his?

**AAR.**
==136==Why, so, brave lords, when we join in league
==137==I am a lamb, but if you brave the Moor,
==138==The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
==139==The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
==140==But say again, how many saw the child?

**NUR.**
==141==Cornelia the midwife, and myself,
==142==And no one else but the delivered Empress.

**AAR.**
==143==The Emperess, the midwife, and yourself.
==144==Two may keep counsel when the third’s away.
==145==Go to the Empress, tell her this I said.
*(He kills her.)*
==146==Weeke, weeke!—so cries a pig prepared to the spit.

**DEM.**
==147==What mean’st thou, Aaron? Wherefore didst thou this?

**AAR.**
==148==O Lord, sir, ’tis a deed of policy.
==149==Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
==150==A long-tongu’d babbling gossip? No, lords, no.
==151==And now be it known to you my full intent.
==152==Not far, one Muliteus my countryman
==153==His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
==154==His child is like to her, fair as you are.
==155==Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
==156==And tell them both the circumstance of all,
==157==And how by this their child shall be advanc’d,
==158==And be received for the Emperor’s heir,
==159==And substituted in the place of mine,
==160==To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
==161==And let the Emperor dandle him for his own.
==162==Hark ye, lords, you see I have given her physic,
*(Pointing to the Nurse.)*
==163==And you must needs bestow her funeral;
==164==The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms.
==165==This done, see that you take no longer days,
==166==But send the midwife presently to me.
==167==The midwife and the nurse well made away,
==168==Then let the ladies tattle what they please.

**CHI.**
==169==Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
==170==With secrets.

**DEM.**
==170==        For this care of Tamora,
==171==Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.

*Exeunt Demetrius and Chiron, bearing off the Nurse’s body.*

**AAR.**
==172==Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies,
==173==There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
==174==And secretly to greet the Empress’ friends.
==175==Come on, you thick-lipp’d slave, I’ll bear you hence,
==176==For it is you that puts us to our shifts.
==177==I’ll make you feed on berries and on roots,
==178==And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
==179==And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
==180==To be a warrior and command a camp.

*Exit.*
