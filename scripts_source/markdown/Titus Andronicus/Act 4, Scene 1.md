## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. Titus’ garden.*

*Enter Lucius’ Son, and Lavinia running after him, and the boy flies from her, with his books under his arm. Enter Titus and Marcus.*

**Y. LUC.**
==1==Help, grandsire, help! My aunt Lavinia
==2==Follows me every where, I know not why.
==3==Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
==4==Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.

**MARC.**
==5==Stand by me, Lucius, do not fear thine aunt.

**TIT.**
==6==She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.

**Y. LUC.**
==7==Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.

**MARC.**
==8==What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?

**TIT.**
==9==Fear her not, Lucius, somewhat doth she mean.

**MARC.**
==10==See, Lucius, see, how much she makes of thee;
==11==Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
==12==Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
==13==Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
==14==Sweet poetry and Tully’s Orator.
==15==Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?

**Y. LUC.**
==16==My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
==17==Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her;
==18==For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,
==19==Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
==20==And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
==21==Ran mad for sorrow. That made me to fear,
==22==Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
==23==Loves me as dear as e’er my mother did,
==24==And would not, but in fury, fright my youth,
==25==Which made me down to throw my books, and fly⁠—
==26==Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt,
==27==And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
==28==I will most willingly attend your ladyship.

**MARC.**
==29==Lucius, I will.

*Lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which Lucius has let fall.*

**TIT.**
==30==How now, Lavinia? Marcus, what means this?
==31==Some book there is that she desires to see.
==32==Which is it, girl, of these?—Open them, boy.⁠—
==33==But thou art deeper read, and better skill’d;
==34==Come and take choice of all my library,
==35==And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
==36==Reveal the damn’d contriver of this deed.
==37==Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?

**MARC.**
==38==I think she means that there were more than one
==39==Confederate in the fact; ay, more there was;
==40==Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.

**TIT.**
==41==Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?

**Y. LUC.**
==42==Grandsire, ’tis Ovid’s Metamorphosis,
==43==My mother gave it me.

**MARC.**
==43==              For love of her that’s gone,
==44==Perhaps, she cull’d it from among the rest.

**TIT.**
==45==Soft, so busily she turns the leaves! Help her.
==46==What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
==47==This is the tragic tale of Philomel,
==48==And treats of Tereus’ treason and his rape⁠—
==49==And rape, I fear, was root of thy annoy.

**MARC.**
==50==See, brother, see, note how she cotes the leaves.

**TIT.**
==51==Lavinia, wert thou thus surpris’d, sweet girl?
==52==Ravish’d and wrong’d as Philomela was,
==53==Forc’d in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods?
==54==See, see!
==55==Ay, such a place there is where we did hunt
==56==(O had we never, never hunted there!),
==57==Pattern’d by that the poet here describes,
==58==By nature made for murders and for rapes.

**MARC.**
==59==O why should nature build so foul a den,
==60==Unless the gods delight in tragedies?

**TIT.**
==61==Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none but friends,
==62==What Roman lord it was durst do the deed;
==63==Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
==64==That left the camp to sin in Lucrece’ bed?

**MARC.**
==65==Sit down, sweet niece; brother, sit down by me.
==66==Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
==67==Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
==68==My lord, look here; look here, Lavinia.
*(He writes his name with his staff, and guides it with feet and mouth.)*
==69==This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst,
==70==This after me. I have writ my name,
==71==Without the help of any hand at all.
==72==Curs’d be that heart that forc’d us to this shift!
==73==Write thou, good niece, and here display at last
==74==What God will have discovered for revenge.
==75==Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
==76==That we may know the traitors and the truth!
*(She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it with her stumps, and writes.)*
==77==O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?

**TIT.**
==78==“*Stuprum*—Chiron—Demetrius.”

**MARC.**
==79==What, what, the lustful sons of Tamora
==80==Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?

**TIT.**
==81==*Magni Dominator poli*,
==82==*Tam lentus audis scelera? Tam lentus vides?*

**MARC.**
==83==O, calm thee, gentle lord, although I know
==84==There is enough written upon this earth
==85==To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts,
==86==And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
==87==My lord, kneel down with me, Lavinia, kneel,
==88==And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector’s hope,
==89==And swear with me, as with the woeful fere
==90==And father of that chaste dishonored dame,
==91==Lord Junius Brutus swear for Lucrece’ rape,
==92==That we will prosecute by good advice
==93==Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
==94==And see their blood or die with this reproach.

**TIT.**
==95==’Tis sure enough, and you knew how,
==96==But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware,
==97==The dam will wake and if she wind ye once,
==98==She’s with the lion deeply still in league,
==99==And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
==100==And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
==101==You are a young huntsman, Marcus, let alone;
==102==And come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
==103==And with a gad of steel will write these words,
==104==And lay it by. The angry northen wind
==105==Will blow these sands like Sibyl’s leaves abroad,
==106==And where’s our lesson then? Boy, what say you?

**Y. LUC.**
==107==I say, my lord, that if I were a man,
==108==Their mother’s bedchamber should not be safe
==109==For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome.

**MARC.**
==110==Ay, that’s my boy! Thy father hath full oft
==111==For his ungrateful country done the like.

**Y. LUC.**
==112==And, uncle, so will I, and if I live.

**TIT.**
==113==Come go with me into mine armory;
==114==Lucius, I’ll fit thee, and withal my boy
==115==Shall carry from me to the Empress’ sons
==116==Presents that I intend to send them both.
==117==Come, come, thou’lt do my message, wilt thou not?

**Y. LUC.**
==118==Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.

**TIT.**
==119==No, boy, not so, I’ll teach thee another course.
==120==Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house,
==121==Lucius and I’ll go brave it at the court.
==122==Ay, marry, will we, sir, and we’ll be waited on.

*Exeunt Titus, Lavinia, and Boy.*

**MARC.**
==123==O heavens, can you hear a good man groan
==124==And not relent, or not compassion him?
==125==Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,
==126==That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
==127==Than foemen’s marks upon his batt’red shield,
==128==But yet so just that he will not revenge.
==129==Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus!

*Exit.*
