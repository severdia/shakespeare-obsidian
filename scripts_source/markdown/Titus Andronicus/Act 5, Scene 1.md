## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Plains near Rome.*

*Flourish. Enter Lucius with an army of Goths, with Drums and Soldiers.*

**LUC.**
==1==Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
==2==I have received letters from great Rome
==3==Which signifies what hate they bear their emperor,
==4==And how desirous of our sight they are.
==5==Therefore, great lords, be as your titles witness,
==6==Imperious, and impatient of your wrongs,
==7==And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
==8==Let him make treble satisfaction.

**1. GOTH.**
==9==Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
==10==Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort,
==11==Whose high exploits and honorable deeds
==12==Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
==13==Be bold in us, we’ll follow where thou lead’st,
==14==Like stinging bees in hottest summer’s day,
==15==Led by their master to the flow’red fields,
==16==And be adveng’d on cursed Tamora.

**3. GOTH.**
==17==And as he saith, so say we all with him.

**LUC.**
==18==I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
==19==But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?

*Enter a Goth leading of Aaron with his child in his arms.*

**2. GOTH.**
==20==Renowmed Lucius, from our troops I stray’d
==21==To gaze upon a ruinous monastery,
==22==And as I earnestly did fix mine eye
==23==Upon the wasted building, suddenly
==24==I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
==25==I made unto the noise, when soon I heard
==26==The crying babe controll’d with this discourse:
==27==“Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dame.
==28==Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
==29==Had nature lent thee but thy mother’s look,
==30==Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.
==31==But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
==32==They never do beget a coal-black calf.
==33==Peace, villain, peace!”—even thus he rates the babe⁠—
==34==“For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,
==35==Who, when he knows thou art the Empress’ babe,
==36==Will hold thee dearly for thy mother’s sake.”
==37==With this, my weapon drawn, I rush’d upon him,
==38==Surpris’d him suddenly, and brought him hither
==39==To use as you think needful of the man.

**LUC.**
==40==O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
==41==That robb’d Andronicus of his good hand;
==42==This is the pearl that pleas’d your empress’ eye,
==43==And here’s the base fruit of her burning lust.
==44==Say, wall-ey’d slave, whither wouldst thou convey
==45==This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
==46==Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?
==47==A halter, soldiers! Hang him on this tree,
==48==And by his side his fruit of bastardy.

**AAR.**
==49==Touch not the boy, he is of royal blood.

**LUC.**
==50==Too like the sire forever being good.
==51==First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl⁠—
==52==A sight to vex the father’s soul withal.
==53==Get me a ladder.

*A ladder brought, which Aaron is made to ascend.*

**AAR.**
==53==           Lucius, save the child
==54==And bear it from me to the Emperess.
==55==If thou do this, I’ll show thee wondrous things,
==56==That highly may advantage thee to hear.
==57==If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
==58==I’ll speak no more but “Vengeance rot you all!”

**LUC.**
==59==Say on, and if it please me which thou speak’st,
==60==Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish’d.

**AAR.**
==61==And if it please thee? Why, assure thee, Lucius,
==62==’Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak:
==63==For I must talk of murders, rapes, and massacres,
==64==Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
==65==Complots of mischief, treason, villainies,
==66==Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform’d.
==67==And this shall all be buried in my death,
==68==Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.

**LUC.**
==69==Tell on thy mind, I say thy child shall live.

**AAR.**
==70==Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.

**LUC.**
==71==Who should I swear by? Thou believest no god:
==72==That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?

**AAR.**
==73==What if I do not? As indeed I do not,
==74==Yet for I know thou art religious,
==75==And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
==76==With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
==77==Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
==78==Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
==79==An idiot holds his bauble for a god,
==80==And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
==81==To that I’ll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
==82==By that same god, what god soe’er it be
==83==That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
==84==To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up,
==85==Or else I will discover nought to thee.

**LUC.**
==86==Even by my God I swear to thee I will.

**AAR.**
==87==First know thou, I begot him on the Empress.

**LUC.**
==88==O most insatiate and luxurious woman!

**AAR.**
==89==Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
==90==To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
==91==’Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;
==92==They cut thy sister’s tongue, and ravish’d her,
==93==And cut her hands, and trimm’d her as thou sawest.

**LUC.**
==94==O detestable villain, call’st thou that trimming?

**AAR.**
==95==Why, she was wash’d, and cut, and trimm’d, and ’twas
==96==Trim sport for them which had the doing of it.

**LUC.**
==97==O barbarous, beastly villains like thyself!

**AAR.**
==98==Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them.
==99==That codding spirit had they from their mother,
==100==As sure a card as ever won the set;
==101==That bloody mind I think they learn’d of me,
==102==As true a dog as ever fought at head.
==103==Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth:
==104==I train’d thy brethren to that guileful hole,
==105==Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;
==106==I wrote the letter that thy father found,
==107==And hid the gold within that letter mentioned,
==108==Confederate with the Queen and her two sons;
==109==And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
==110==Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
==111==I play’d the cheater for thy father’s hand,
==112==And when I had it, drew myself apart,
==113==And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.
==114==I pried me through the crevice of a wall,
==115==When, for his hand, he had his two sons’ heads,
==116==Beheld his tears, and laugh’d so heartily
==117==That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;
==118==And when I told the Empress of this sport,
==119==She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,
==120==And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.

**1. GOTH.**
==121==What, canst thou say all this and never blush?

**AAR.**
==122==Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.

**LUC.**
==123==Are thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?

**AAR.**
==124==Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
==125==Even now I curse the day—and yet I think
==126==Few come within the compass of my curse⁠—
==127==Wherein I did not some notorious ill:
==128==As kill a man, or else devise his death,
==129==Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
==130==Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself,
==131==Set deadly enmity between two friends,
==132==Make poor men’s cattle break their necks,
==133==Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night,
==134==And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
==135==Oft have I digg’d up dead men from their graves,
==136==And set them upright at their dear friends’ door,
==137==Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,
==138==And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
==139==Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
==140==“Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.”
==141==But I have done a thousand dreadful things,
==142==As willingly as one would kill a fly,
==143==And nothing grieves me heartily indeed,
==144==But that I cannot do ten thousand more.

**LUC.**
==145==Bring down the devil, for he must not die
==146==So sweet a death as hanging presently.

**AAR.**
==147==If there be devils, would I were a devil,
==148==To live and burn in everlasting fire,
==149==So I might have your company in hell,
==150==But to torment you with my bitter tongue!

**LUC.**
==151==Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.

*Enter Aemilius.*

**3. GOTH.**
==152==My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
==153==Desires to be admitted to your presence.

**LUC.**
==154==Let him come near.
==155==Welcome, Aemilius, what’s the news from Rome?

**AEMIL.**
==156==Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
==157==The Roman Emperor greets you all by me,
==158==And for he understands you are in arms,
==159==He craves a parley at your father’s house,
==160==Willing you to demand your hostages,
==161==And they shall be immediately delivered.

**1. GOTH.**
==162==What says our general?

**LUC.**
==163==Aemilius, let the Emperor give his pledges
==164==Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
==165==And we will come. March away.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
