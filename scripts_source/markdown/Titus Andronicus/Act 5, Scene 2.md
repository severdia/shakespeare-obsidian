## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Rome. Before Titus’ house.*

*Enter Tamora and her two sons, Demetrius and Chiron, disguised.*

**TAM.**
==1==Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
==2==I will encounter with Andronicus,
==3==And say I am Revenge, sent from below
==4==To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
==5==Knock at his study, where they say he keeps
==6==To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;
==7==Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,
==8==And work confusion on his enemies.

*They knock, and Titus above opens his study door.*

**TIT.**
==9==Who doth molest my contemplation?
==10==Is it your trick to make me ope the door
==11==That so my sad decrees may fly away,
==12==And all my study be to no effect?
==13==You are deceiv’d, for what I mean to do
==14==See here in bloody lines I have set down:
==15==And what is written shall be executed.

**TAM.**
==16==Titus, I am come to talk with thee.

**TIT.**
==17==No, not a word, how can I grace my talk,
==18==Wanting a hand to give’t that accord?
==19==Thou hast the odds of me, therefore no more.

**TAM.**
==20==If thou didst know me, thou wouldst talk with me.

**TIT.**
==21==I am not mad, I know thee well enough.
==22==Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines.
==23==Witness these trenches made by grief and care,
==24==Witness the tiring day and heavy night,
==25==Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well
==26==For our proud Empress, mighty Tamora.
==27==Is not thy coming for my other hand?

**TAM.**
==28==Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;
==29==She is thy enemy, and I thy friend.
==30==I am Revenge, sent from th’ infernal kingdom
==31==To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,
==32==By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
==33==Come down and welcome me to this world’s light;
==34==Confer with me of murder and of death.
==35==There’s not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
==36==No vast obscurity or misty vale,
==37==Where bloody murder or detested rape
==38==Can couch for fear, but I will find them out,
==39==And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
==40==Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.

**TIT.**
==41==Art thou Revenge? And art thou sent to me,
==42==To be a torment to mine enemies?

**TAM.**
==43==I am, therefore come down and welcome me.

**TIT.**
==44==Do me some service ere I come to thee.
==45==Lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
==46==Now give some surance that thou art Revenge⁠—
==47==Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels,
==48==And then I’ll come and be thy wagoner,
==49==And whirl along with thee about the globes.
==50==Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
==51==To hale thy vengeful wagon swift away,
==52==And find out murderers in their guilty caves;
==53==And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
==54==I will dismount, and by thy wagon-wheel
==55==Trot like a servile footman all day long,
==56==Even from Hyperion’s rising in the east,
==57==Until his very downfall in the sea;
==58==And day by day I’ll do this heavy task,
==59==So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.

**TAM.**
==60==These are my ministers, and come with me.

**TIT.**
==61==Are they thy ministers? What are they call’d?

**TAM.**
==62==Rape and Murder, therefore called so
==63==’Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.

**TIT.**
==64==Good Lord, how like the Empress’ sons they are!
==65==And you, the Empress! But we wordly men
==66==Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
==67==O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee,
==68==And if one arm’s embracement will content thee,
==69==I will embrace thee in it by and by.

*Exit above.*

**TAM.**
==70==This closing with him fits his lunacy.
==71==What e’er I forge to feed his brain-sick humors,
==72==Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
==73==For now he firmly takes me for Revenge,
==74==And being credulous in this mad thought,
==75==I’ll make him send for Lucius his son;
==76==And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
==77==I’ll find some cunning practice out of hand,
==78==To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
==79==Or at the least make them his enemies.
==80==See here he comes, and I must ply my theme.

*Enter Titus below.*

**TIT.**
==81==Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee.
==82==Welcome, dread Fury, to my woeful house;
==83==Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
==84==How like the Empress and her sons you are!
==85==Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor.
==86==Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
==87==For well I wot the Empress never wags
==88==But in her company there is a Moor;
==89==And would you represent our queen aright,
==90==It were convenient you had such a devil.
==91==But welcome as you are: what shall we do?

**TAM.**
==92==What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?

**DEM.**
==93==Show me a murderer, I’ll deal with him.

**CHI.**
==94==Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
==95==And I am sent to be reveng’d on him.

**TAM.**
==96==Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong,
==97==And I will be revenged on them all.

**TIT.**
==98==Look round about the wicked streets of Rome,
==99==And when thou find’st a man that’s like thyself,
==100==Good Murder, stab him, he’s a murderer.
==101==Go thou with him, and when it is thy hap
==102==To find another that is like to thee,
==103==Good Rapine, stab him, he is a ravisher.
==104==Go thou with them, and in the Emperor’s court
==105==There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
==106==Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion,
==107==For up and down she doth resemble thee.
==108==I pray thee do on them some violent death,
==109==They have been violent to me and mine.

**TAM.**
==110==Well hast thou lesson’d us, this shall we do.
==111==But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
==112==To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
==113==Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
==114==And bid him come and banquet at thy house,
==115==When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
==116==I will bring in the Empress and her sons,
==117==The Emperor himself and all thy foes,
==118==And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel,
==119==And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
==120==What says Andronicus to this device?

**TIT.**
==121==Marcus, my brother! ’Tis sad Titus calls.
*(Enter Marcus.)*
==122==Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
==123==Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
==124==Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
==125==Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths.
==126==Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are.
==127==Tell him the Emperor and the Empress too
==128==Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
==129==This do thou for my love, and so let him,
==130==As he regards his aged father’s life.

**MARC.**
==131==This will I do, and soon return again.

*Exit.*

**TAM.**
==132==Now will I hence about thy business,
==133==And take my ministers along with me.

**TIT.**
==134==Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me,
==135==Or else I’ll call my brother back again,
==136==And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.

**TAM.**
*(Aside to her sons)*
==137==What say you, boys, will you abide with him,
==138==Whiles I go tell my lord the Emperor
==139==How I have govern’d our determin’d jest?
==140==Yield to his humor, smooth and speak him fair,
==141==And tarry with him till I turn again.

**TIT.**
*(Aside.)*
==142==I knew them all though they suppos’d me mad,
==143==And will o’erreach them in their own devices,
==144==A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dame.

**DEM.**
==145==Madam, depart at pleasure, leave us here.

**TAM.**
==146==Farewell, Andronicus, Revenge now goes
==147==To lay a complot to betray thy foes.

**TIT.**
==148==I know thou dost, and, sweet Revenge, farewell.

*Exit Tamora.*

**CHI.**
==149==Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ’d?

**TIT.**
==150==Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
==151==Publius, come hither! Caius and Valentine!

*Enter Publius, Caius, and Valentine.*

**PUB.**
==152==What is your will?

**TIT.**
==153==Know you these two?

**PUB.**
==154==The Empress’ sons I take them, Chiron, Demetrius.

**TIT.**
==155==Fie, Publius, fie, thou art too much deceiv’d.
==156==The one is Murder, and Rape is the other’s name,
==157==And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.
==158==Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.
==159==Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
==160==And now I find it, therefore bind them sure,
==161==And stop their mouths if they begin to cry.

*Exit Titus.*

*Publius, etc., lay hold on Chiron and Demetrius.*

**CHI.**
==162==Villains, forbear, we are the Empress’ sons.

**PUB.**
==163==And therefore do we what we are commanded.
==164==Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
==165==Is he sure bound? Look that you bind them fast.

*Enter Titus Andronicus with a knife and Lavinia with a basin.*

**TIT.**
==166==Come, come, Lavinia, look, thy foes are bound.
==167==Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me,
==168==But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
==169==O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
==170==Here stands the spring whom you have stain’d with mud,
==171==This goodly summer with your winter mix’d.
==172==You kill’d her husband, and for that vild fault
==173==Two of her brothers were condemn’d to death,
==174==My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
==175==Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
==176==Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
==177==Inhuman traitors, you constrain’d and forc’d.
==178==What would you say if I should let you speak?
==179==Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
==180==Hark, wretches, how I mean to martyr you.
==181==This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
==182==Whiles that Lavinia ’tween her stumps doth hold
==183==The basin that receives your guilty blood.
==184==You know your mother means to feast with me,
==185==And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad.
==186==Hark, villains, I will grind your bones to dust,
==187==And with your blood and it I’ll make a paste,
==188==And of the paste a coffin I will rear,
==189==And make two pasties of your shameful heads,
==190==And bid that strumpet, your unhallowed dam,
==191==Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
==192==This is the feast that I have bid her to,
==193==And this the banquet she shall surfeit on,
==194==For worse than Philomel you us’d my daughter,
==195==And worse than Progne I will be reveng’d.
==196==And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
==197==Receive the blood, and when that they are dead,
==198==Let me go grind their bones to powder small,
==199==And with this hateful liquor temper it,
==200==And in that paste let their vile heads be bak’d.
==201==Come, come, be every one officious
==202==To make this banquet, which I wish may prove
==203==More stern and bloody than the Centaurs’ feast.
*(He cuts their throats.)*
==204==So now bring them in, for I’ll play the cook,
==205==And see them ready against their mother comes.

*Exeunt bearing the dead bodies.*
