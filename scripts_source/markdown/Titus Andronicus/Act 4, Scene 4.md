## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. Before the Palace.*

*Enter Emperor and Empress and her two sons (Demetrius and Chiron), Lords, and others; the Emperor brings the arrow in his hand that Titus shot at him.*

**SAT.**
==1==Why, lords, what wrongs are these! Was ever seen
==2==An emperor in Rome thus overborne,
==3==Troubled, confronted thus, and, for the extent
==4==Of equal justice, us’d in such contempt?
==5==My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
==6==However these disturbers of our peace
==7==Buzz in the people’s ears, there nought hath pass’d,
==8==But even with law, against the willful sons
==9==Of old Andronicus. And what and if
==10==His sorrows have so overwhelm’d his wits?
==11==Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
==12==His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
==13==And now he writes to heaven for his redress.
==14==See, here’s to Jove, and this to Mercury,
==15==This to Apollo, this to the god of war:
==16==Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
==17==What’s this but libelling against the Senate,
==18==And blazoning our unjustice every where?
==19==A goodly humor, is it not, my lords?
==20==As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
==21==But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
==22==Shall be no shelter to these outrages,
==23==But he and his shall know that justice lives
==24==In Saturninus’ health, whom, if he sleep,
==25==He’ll so awake as he in fury shall
==26==Cut off the proud’st conspirator that lives.

**TAM.**
==27==My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
==28==Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
==29==Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus’ age,
==30==Th’ effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
==31==Whose loss hath pierc’d him deep and scarr’d his heart,
==32==And rather comfort his distressed plight
==33==Than prosecute the meanest or the best
==34==For these contempts.
*(Aside.)*
==34==              Why, thus it shall become
==35==High-witted Tamora to gloze with all;
==36==But, Titus, I have touch’d thee to the quick;
==37==Thy life-blood out, if Aaron now be wise,
==38==Then is all safe, the anchor in the port.
*(Enter Clown.)*
==39==How now, good fellow, wouldst thou speak with us?

**CLO.**
==40==Yea forsooth, and your mistriship be emperial.

**TAM.**
==41==Empress I am, but yonder sits the Emperor.

**CLO.**
==42==’Tis he. God and Saint Steven give you godde. I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.

*Saturninus reads the letter.*

**SAT.**
==43==Go take him away and hang him presently.

**CLO.**
==44==How much money must I have?

**TAM.**
==45==Come, sirrah, you must be hang’d.

**CLO.**
==46==Hang’d! By’ lady, then I have brought up a neck to a fair end.

*Exit guarded.*

**SAT.**
==47==Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
==48==Shall I endure this monstrous villainy?
==49==I know from whence this same device proceeds.
==50==May this be borne as if his traitorous sons,
==51==That died by law for murder of our brother,
==52==Have by my means been butchered wrongfully?
==53==Go drag the villain hither by the hair,
==54==Nor age nor honor shall shape privilege;
==55==For this proud mock I’ll be thy slaughter-man,
==56==Sly frantic wretch, that help’st to make me great,
==57==In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
*(Enter Nuntius Aemilius.)*
==58==What news with thee, Aemilius?

**AEMIL.**
==59==Arm, my lords! Rome never had more cause.
==60==The Goths have gathered head, and with a power
==61==Of high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,
==62==They hither march amain, under conduct
==63==Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus,
==64==Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
==65==As much as ever Coriolanus did.

**SAT.**
==66==Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
==67==These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
==68==As flowers with frost, or grass beat down with storms.
==69==Ay, now begins our sorrows to approach.
==70==’Tis he the common people love so much;
==71==Myself hath often heard them say,
==72==When I have walked like a private man,
==73==That Lucius’ banishment was wrongfully,
==74==And they have wish’d that Lucius were their emperor.

**TAM.**
==75==Why should you fear? Is not your city strong?

**SAT.**
==76==Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,
==77==And will revolt from me to succor him.

**TAM.**
==78==King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
==79==Is the sun dimm’d, that gnats do fly in it?
==80==The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
==81==And is not careful what they mean thereby,
==82==Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
==83==He can at pleasure stint their melody;
==84==Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome.
==85==Then cheer thy spirit, for know thou, Emperor,
==86==I will enchant the old Andronicus
==87==With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
==88==Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
==89==When as the one is wounded with the bait,
==90==The other rotted with delicious feed.

**SAT.**
==91==But he will not entreat his son for us.

**TAM.**
==92==If Tamora entreat him, then he will,
==93==For I can smooth and fill his aged ears
==94==With golden promises, that, were his heart
==95==Almost impregnable, his old years deaf,
==96==Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
*(To Aemilius.)*
==97==Go thou before, to be our ambassador.
==98==Say that the Emperor requests a parley
==99==Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting
==100==Even at his father’s house, the old Andronicus.

**SAT.**
==101==Aemilius, do this message honorably,
==102==And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
==103==Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.

**AEMIL.**
==104==Your bidding shall I do effectually.

*Exit.*

**TAM.**
==105==Now will I to that old Andronicus,
==106==And temper him with all the art I have,
==107==To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths,
==108==And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,
==109==And bury all thy fear in my devices.

**SAT.**
==110==Then go successantly, and plead to him.

*Exeunt.*
