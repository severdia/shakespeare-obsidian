## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. A street.*

*Enter the Judges and Senators and Tribunes, with Titus’ two sons Martius and Quintus bound, passing on the stage to the place of execution, and Titus going before, pleading.*

**TIT.**
==1== Hear me, grave fathers! Noble tribunes, stay!
==2== For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
==3== In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;
==4== For all my blood in Rome’s great quarrel shed,
==5== For all the frosty nights that I have watch’d,
==6== And for these bitter tears which now you see
==7== Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,
==8== Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
==9== Whose souls is not corrupted as ’tis thought.
==10== For two and twenty sons I never wept,
==11== Because they died in honor’s lofty bed.
*(Andronicus lieth down.)*
*(The Judges, etc. pass by him and exeunt with the prisoners.)*
==12== For these, tribunes, in the dust I write
==13== My heart’s deep languor, and my soul’s sad tears:
==14== Let my tears staunch the earth’s dry appetite,
==15== My sons’ sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
==16== O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,
==17== That shall distill from these two ancient urns,
==18== Than youthful April shall with all his show’rs.
==19== In summer’s drought I’ll drop upon thee still,
==20== In winter with warm tears I’ll melt the snow,
==21== And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
==22== So thou refuse to drink my dear sons’ blood.
*(Enter Lucius with his weapon drawn.)*
==23== O reverent tribunes! O gentle, aged men!
==24== Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,
==25== And let me say (that never wept before) 
==26== My tears are now prevailing orators.

**LUC.**
==27== O noble father, you lament in vain:
==28== The tribunes hear you not, no man is by,
==29== And you recount your sorrows to a stone.

**TIT.**
==30== Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
==31== Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you⁠—

**LUC.**
==32== My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.

**TIT.**
==33== Why, ’tis no matter, man: if they did hear,
==34== They would not mark me; if they did mark,
==35== They would not pity me; yet plead I must,
==36== And bootless unto them.
==37== Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,
==38== Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
==39== Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
==40== For that they will not intercept my tale.
==41== When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
==42== Receive my tears, and seem to weep with me,
==43== And were they but attired in grave weeds,
==44== Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.
==45== A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than stones;
==46== A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
==47== And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
*(Rises.)*
==48== But wherefore stand’st thou with thy weapon drawn?

**LUC.**
==49== To rescue my two brothers from their death,
==50== For which attempt the judges have pronounc’d
==51== My everlasting doom of banishment.

**TIT.**
==52== O happy man, they have befriended thee!
==53== Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
==54== That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
==55== Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
==56== But me and mine. How happy art thou then,
==57== From these devourers to be banished!
==58== But who comes with our brother Marcus here?

*Enter Marcus with Lavinia.*

**MARC.**
==59== Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep,
==60== Or if not so, thy noble heart to break:
==61== I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.

**TIT.**
==62== Will it consume me? Let me see it then.

**MARC.**
==63== This was thy daughter.

**TIT.**
==63==            Why, Marcus, so she is.

**LUC.**
==64== Ay me, this object kills me!

**TIT.**
==65== Faint-hearted boy, arise and look upon her.
==66== Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
==67== Hath made thee handless in thy father’s sight?
==68== What fool hath added water to the sea?
==69== Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
==70== My grief was at the height before thou cam’st,
==71== And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.
==72== Give me a sword, I’ll chop off my hands too,
==73== For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
==74== And they have nurs’d this woe, in feeding life;
==75== In bootless prayer have they been held up,
==76== And they have serv’d me to effectless use.
==77== Now all the service I require of them
==78== Is that the one will help to cut the other.
==79== ’Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,
==80== For hands to do Rome service is but vain.

**LUC.**
==81== Speak, gentle sister, who hath mart’red thee?

**MARC.**
==82== O, that delightful engine of her thoughts,
==83== That blabb’d them with such pleasing eloquence,
==84== Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
==85== Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung
==86== Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!

**LUC.**
==87== O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?

**MARC.**
==88== O, thus I found her straying in the park,
==89== Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer
==90== That hath receiv’d some unrecuring wound.

**TIT.**
==91== It was my dear, and he that wounded her
==92== Hath hurt me more than had he kill’d me dead:
==93== For now I stand as one upon a rock,
==94== Environ’d with a wilderness of sea,
==95== Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
==96== Expecting ever when some envious surge
==97== Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
==98== This way to death my wretched sons are gone,
==99== Here stands my other son, a banish’d man,
==100== And here my brother, weeping at my woes;
==101== But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn
==102== Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
==103== Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
==104== It would have madded me; what shall I do
==105== Now I behold thy lively body so?
==106== Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,
==107== Nor tongue to tell me who hath mart’red thee.
==108== Thy husband he is dead, and for his death
==109== Thy brothers are condemn’d, and dead by this.
==110== Look, Marcus! Ah, son Lucius, look on her!
==111== When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
==112== Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
==113== Upon a gath’red lily almost withered.

**MARC.**
==114== Perchance she weeps because they kill’d her husband,
==115== Perchance because she knows them innocent.

**TIT.**
==116== If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,
==117== Because the law hath ta’en revenge on them.
==118== No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
==119== Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
==120== Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,
==121== Or make some sign how I may do thee ease.
==122== Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
==123== And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
==124== Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks,
==125== How they are stain’d like meadows yet not dry,
==126== With miry slime left on them by a flood?
==127== And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
==128== Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
==129== And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
==130== Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?
==131== Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
==132== Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
==133== What shall we do? Let us that have our tongues
==134== Plot some device of further misery,
==135== To make us wonder’d at in time to come.

**LUC.**
==136== Sweet father, cease your tears, for at your grief
==137== See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.

**MARC.**
==138== Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.

**TIT.**
==139== Ah, Marcus, Marcus! Brother, well I wot,
==140== Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
==141== For thou, poor man, hast drown’d it with thine own.

**LUC.**
==142== Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.

**TIT.**
==143== Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs.
==144== Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
==145== That to her brother which I said to thee:
==146== His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
==147== Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
==148== O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
==149== As far from help as limbo is from bliss!

*Enter Aaron the Moor alone.*

**AAR.**
==150== Titus Andronicus, my lord the Emperor
==151== Sends thee this word—that, if thou love thy sons,
==152== Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
==153== Or any one of you, chop off your hand
==154== And send it to the King; he for the same
==155== Will send thee hither both thy sons alive,
==156== And that shall be the ransom for their fault.

**TIT.**
==157== O gracious Emperor! O gentle Aaron!
==158== Did ever raven sing so like a lark
==159== That gives sweet tidings of the sun’s uprise?
==160== With all my heart I’ll send the Emperor my hand.
==161== Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?

**LUC.**
==162== Stay, father, for that noble hand of thine,
==163== That hath thrown down so many enemies,
==164== Shall not be sent. My hand will serve the turn.
==165== My youth can better spare my blood than you,
==166== And therefore mine shall save my brothers’ lives.

**MARC.**
==167== Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,
==168== And rear’d aloft the bloody battle-axe,
==169== Writing destruction on the enemy’s castle?
==170== O, none of both but are of high desert.
==171== My hand hath been but idle, let it serve
==172== To ransom my two nephews from their death;
==173== Then have I kept it to a worthy end.

**AAR.**
==174== Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
==175== For fear they die before their pardon come.

**MARC.**
==176== My hand shall go.

**LUC.**
==176==            By heaven, it shall not go!

**TIT.**
==177== Sirs, strive no more: such with’red herbs as these
==178== Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.

**LUC.**
==179== Sweet rather, if I shall be thought thy son,
==180== Let me redeem my brothers both from death.

**MARC.**
==181== And for our father’s sake, and mother’s care,
==182== Now let me show a brother’s love to thee.

**TIT.**
==183== Agree between you, I will spare my hand.

**LUC.**
==184== Then I’ll go fetch an axe.

**MARC.**
==185== But I will use the axe.

*Exeunt Lucius and Marcus.*

**TIT.**
==186== Come hither, Aaron. I’ll deceive them both;
==187== Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.

**AAR.**
*(Aside.)*
==188== If that be call’d deceit, I will be honest,
==189== And never whilst I live deceive men so;
==190== But I’ll deceive you in another sort,
==191== And that you’ll say ere half an hour pass.

*He cuts off Titus’ hand.*

*Enter Lucius and Marcus again.*

**TIT.**
==192== Now stay your strife, what shall be is dispatch’d.
==193== Good Aaron, give his Majesty my hand.
==194== Tell him it was a hand that warded him
==195== From thousand dangers, bid him bury it:
==196== More hath it merited, that let it have.
==197== As for my sons, say I account of them
==198== As jewels purchas’d at an easy price,
==199== And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.

**AAR.**
==200== I go, Andronicus, and for thy hand
==201== Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
*(Aside.)*
==202== Their heads, I mean. O how this villainy
==203== Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
==204== Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace,
==205== Aaron will have his soul black like his face.

*Exit.*

**TIT.**
==206== O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
==207== And bow this feeble ruin to the earth;
==208== If any power pities wretched tears,
==209== To that I call!
*(To Lavinia.)*
==209==         What, wouldst thou kneel with me?
==210== Do then, dear heart, for heaven shall hear our prayers,
==211== Or with our sighs we’ll breathe the welkin dim,
==212== And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
==213== When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.

**MARC.**
==214== O brother, speak with possibility,
==215== And do not break into these deep extremes.

**TIT.**
==216== Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
==217== Then be my passions bottomless with them!

**MARC.**
==218== But yet let reason govern thy lament.

**TIT.**
==219== If there were reason for these miseries,
==220== Then into limits could I bind my woes:
==221== When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o’erflow?
==222== If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
==223== Threat’ning the welkin with his big-swoll’n face?
==224== And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
==225== I am the sea; hark how her sighs doth blow!
==226== She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
==227== Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
==228== Then must my earth with her continual tears
==229== Become a deluge, overflow’d and drown’d:
==230== For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
==231== But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
==232== Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
==233== To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

*Enter a Messenger, with two heads and a hand.*

**MESS.**
==234== Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
==235== For that good hand thou sent’st the Emperor.
==236== Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,
==237== And here’s thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back⁠—
==238== Thy grief their sports! Thy resolution mock’d!
==239== That woe is me to think upon thy woes,
==240== More than remembrance of my father’s death.

*Exit.*

**MARC.**
==241== Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,
==242== And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
==243== These miseries are more than may be borne.
==244== To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,
==245== But sorrow flouted at is double death.

**LUC.**
==246== Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
==247== And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
==248== That ever death should let life bear his name,
==249== Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!

*Lavinia kisses Titus.*

**MARC.**
==250== Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
==251== As frozen water to a starved snake.

**TIT.**
==252== When will this fearful slumber have an end?

**MARC.**
==253== Now farewell, flatt’ry; die, Andronicus.
==254== Thou dost not slumber; see thy two sons’ heads,
==255== Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here,
==256== Thy other banish’d son with this dear sight
==257== Struck pale and bloodless, and thy brother, I,
==258== Even like a stony image, cold and numb.
==259== Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs.
==260== Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand
==261== Gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismal sight
==262== The closing up of our most wretched eyes.
==263== Now is a time to storm, why art thou still?

**TIT.**
==264== Ha, ha, ha!

**MARC.**
==265== Why dost thou laugh? It fits not with this hour.

**TIT.**
==266== Why, I have not another tear to shed.
==267== Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
==268== And would usurp upon my wat’ry eyes,
==269== And make them blind with tributary tears;
==270== Then which way shall I find Revenge’s cave?
==271== For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
==272== And threat me I shall never come to bliss
==273== Till all these mischiefs be return’d again,
==274== Even in their throats that hath committed them.
==275== Come let me see what task I have to do.
==276== You heavy people, circle me about,
==277== That I may turn me to each one of you,
==278== And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
==279== The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head,
==280== And in this hand the other will I bear;
==281== And, Lavinia, thou shalt be employ’d;
==282== Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
==283== As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;
==284== Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.
==285== Hie to the Goths and raise an army there,
==286== And if ye love me, as I think you do,
==287== Let’s kiss and part, for we have much to do.

*Exeunt. Manet Lucius.*

**LUC.**
==288== Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,
==289== The woefull’st man that ever liv’d in Rome.
==290== Farewell, proud Rome, till Lucius come again;
==291== He loves his pledges dearer than his life.
==292== Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister,
==293== O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
==294== But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
==295== But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
==296== If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs,
==297== And make proud Saturnine and his emperess
==298== Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.
==299== Now will I to the Goths and raise a pow’r,
==300== To be reveng’d on Rome and Saturnine.

*Exit Lucius.*
