## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*A forest near Rome.*

*Enter Titus Andronicus and his three sons (Lucius, Quintus, and Martius), making a noise with hounds and horns, and Marcus.*

**TIT.**
The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
The fields are fragrant and the woods are green.
Uncouple here and let us make a bay,
And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter’s peal,
That all the court may echo with the noise.
Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
To attend the Emperor’s person carefully.
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
But dawning day new comfort hath inspir’d.
*(Here a cry of hounds, and wind horns in a peal.)*
*(Then enter Saturninus, Tamora, Bassianus, Lavinia, Chiron, Demetrius, and their Attendants.)*
Many good morrows to your Majesty;
Madam, to you as many and as good.
I promised your Grace a hunter’s peal.

**SAT.**
And you have rung it lustily, my lords⁠—
Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.

**BAS.**
Lavinia, how say you?

**LAV.**
              I say, no;
I have been broad awake two hours and more.

**SAT.**
Come on then, horse and chariots let us have,
And to our sport.
*(To Tamora.)*
           Madam, now shall ye see
Our Roman hunting.

**MARC.**
           I have dogs, my lord,
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
And climb the highest promontory top.

**TIT.**
And I have horse will follow where the game
Makes way, and runs like swallows o’er the plain.

**DEM.**
Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

*Exeunt.*
