## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*A forest near Rome.*

*Enter Titus Andronicus and his three sons (Lucius, Quintus, and Martius), making a noise with hounds and horns, and Marcus.*

**TIT.**
==1==The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
==2==The fields are fragrant and the woods are green.
==3==Uncouple here and let us make a bay,
==4==And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride,
==5==And rouse the Prince, and ring a hunter’s peal,
==6==That all the court may echo with the noise.
==7==Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
==8==To attend the Emperor’s person carefully.
==9==I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
==10==But dawning day new comfort hath inspir’d.
*(Here a cry of hounds, and wind horns in a peal.)*
*(Then enter Saturninus, Tamora, Bassianus, Lavinia, Chiron, Demetrius, and their Attendants.)*
==11==Many good morrows to your Majesty;
==12==Madam, to you as many and as good.
==13==I promised your Grace a hunter’s peal.

**SAT.**
==14==And you have rung it lustily, my lords⁠—
==15==Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.

**BAS.**
==16==Lavinia, how say you?

**LAV.**
==16==              I say, no;
==17==I have been broad awake two hours and more.

**SAT.**
==18==Come on then, horse and chariots let us have,
==19==And to our sport.
*(To Tamora.)*
==19==           Madam, now shall ye see
==20==Our Roman hunting.

**MARC.**
==20==           I have dogs, my lord,
==21==Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
==22==And climb the highest promontory top.

**TIT.**
==23==And I have horse will follow where the game
==24==Makes way, and runs like swallows o’er the plain.

**DEM.**
==25==Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
==26==But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

*Exeunt.*
