## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*A room in Titus’ house.*

*A banquet set out.*

*Enter Titus Andronicus, Marcus, Lavinia, and the boy, young Lucius.*

**TIT.**
==1==So, so, now sit, and look you eat no more
==2==Than will preserve just so much strength in us
==3==As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
==4==Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot;
==5==Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands
==6==And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
==7==With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
==8==Is left to tyrannize upon my breast,
==9==Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,
==10==Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
==11==Then thus I thump it down.
*(To Lavinia.)*
==12==Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
==13==When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
==14==Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
==15==Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
==16==Or get some little knife between thy teeth,
==17==And just against thy heart make thou a hole,
==18==That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
==19==May run into that sink, and soaking in,
==20==Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.

**MARC.**
==21==Fie, brother, fie, teach her not thus to lay
==22==Such violent hands upon her tender life.

**TIT.**
==23==How now! Has sorrow made thee dote already?
==24==Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
==25==What violent hands can she lay on her life?
==26==Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands,
==27==To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o’er
==28==How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
==29==O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
==30==Lest we remember still that we have none.
==31==Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
==32==As if we should forget we had no hands,
==33==If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
==34==Come, let’s fall to, and, gentle girl, eat this.
==35==Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
==36==I can interpret all her martyr’d signs:
==37==She says, she drinks no other drink but tears,
==38==Brew’d with her sorrow, mesh’d upon her cheeks.
==39==Speechless complainant, I will learn thy thought;
==40==In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
==41==As begging hermits in their holy prayers.
==42==Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
==43==Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
==44==But I, of these, will wrest an alphabet,
==45==And by still practice learn to know thy meaning.

**Y. LUC.**
==46==Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments,
==47==Make my aunt merry with some pleasing talc.

**MARC.**
==48==Alas, the tender boy, in passion mov’d,
==49==Doth weep to see his grandsire’s heaviness.

**TIT.**
==50==Peace, tender sapling, thou art made of tears,
==51==And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
*(Marcus strikes the dish with a knife.)*
==52==What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?

**MARC.**
==53==At that that I have kill’d, my lord—a fly.

**TIT.**
==54==Out on thee, murderer! Thou kill’st my heart!
==55==Mine eyes are cloy’d with view of tyranny.
==56==A deed of death done on the innocent
==57==Becomes not Titus’ brother. Get thee gone,
==58==I see thou art not for my company.

**MARC.**
==59==Alas, my lord, I have but kill’d a fly.

**TIT.**
==60==“But”? How if that fly had a father and mother?
==61==How would he hang his slender gilded wings
==62==And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
==63==Poor harmless fly,
==64==That, with his pretty buzzing melody,
==65==Came here to make us merry! And thou hast kill’d him.

**MARC.**
==66==Pardon me, sir, it was a black ill-favor’d fly,
==67==Like to the Empress’ Moor, therefore I kill’d him.

**TIT.**
==68==O, O, O,
==69==Then pardon me for reprehending thee,
==70==For thou hast done a charitable deed.
==71==Give me thy knife, I will insult on him,
==72==Flattering myself as if it were the Moor
==73==Come hither purposely to poison me.⁠—
==74==There’s for thyself, and that’s for Tamora.
==75==Ah, sirrah!
==76==Yet I think we are not brought so low,
==77==But that between us we can kill a fly
==78==That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.

**MARC.**
==79==Alas, poor man, grief has so wrought on him,
==80==He takes false shadows for true substances.

**TIT.**
==81==Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me.
==82==I’ll to thy closet, and go read with thee
==83==Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
==84==Come, boy, and go with me, thy sight is young,
==85==And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.

*Exeunt.*
