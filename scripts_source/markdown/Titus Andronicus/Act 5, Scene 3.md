## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]]

*Court of Titus’s house.*

*Enter Lucius, Marcus, and the Goths with Aaron prisoner, and his child in the arms of an Attendant.*

**LUC.**
==1== Uncle Marcus, since ’tis my father’s mind
==2== That I repair to Rome, I am content.

**1. GOTH.**
==3== And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.

**LUC.**
==4== Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
==5== This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
==6== Let him receive no sust’nance; fetter him,
==7== Till he be brought unto the Empress’ face
==8== For testimony of her foul proceedings.
==9== And see the ambush of our friends be strong,
==10== I fear the Emperor means no good to us.

**AAR.**
==11== Some devil whisper curses in my ear,
==12== And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth
==13== The venomous malice of my swelling heart!

**LUC.**
==14== Away, inhuman dog, unhallowed slave!
==15== Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
*(Exeunt Goths with Aaron. Sound trumpets within.)*
==16== The trumpets show the Emperor is at hand.

*Enter Emperor and Empress with Aemilius, Tribunes, Senators, and others.*

**SAT.**
==17== What, hath the firmament more suns than one?

**LUC.**
==18== What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?

**MARC.**
==19== Rome’s emperor, and nephew, break the parle,
==20== These quarrels must be quietly debated.
==21== The feast is ready which the careful Titus
==22== Hath ordain’d to an honorable end,
==23== For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome.
==24== Please you, therefore, draw nigh and take your places.

**SAT.**
==25== Marcus, we will.

*A table brought in. The company sit down.*

*Trumpets sounding, enter Titus like a cook, placing the dishes, and Lavinia with a veil over her face, young Lucius, and others.*

**TIT.**
==26== Welcome, my lord; welcome, dread queen;
==27== Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;
==28== And welcome, all. Although the cheer be poor,
==29== ’Twill fill your stomachs, please you eat of it.

**SAT.**
==30== Why art thou thus attir’d, Andronicus?

**TIT.**
==31== Because I would be sure to have all well,
==32== To entertain your Highness and your empress.

**TAM.**
==33== We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.

**TIT.**
==34== And if your Highness knew my heart, you were.
==35== My Lord the Emperor, resolve me this:
==36== Was it well done of rash Virginius
==37== To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
==38== Because she was enforc’d, stain’d, and deflow’r’d?

**SAT.**
==39== It was, Andronicus.

**TIT.**
==40== Your reason, mighty lord?

**SAT.**
==41== Because the girl should not survive her shame,
==42== And by her presence still renew his sorrows.

**TIT.**
==43== A reason mighty, strong, and effectual,
==44== A pattern, president, and lively warrant
==45== For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
==46== Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee,
==47== And with thy shame thy father’s sorrow die!

*He kills her.*

**SAT.**
==48== What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?

**TIT.**
==49== Kill’d her for whom my tears have made me blind.
==50== I am as woeful as Virginius was,
==51== And have a thousand times more cause than he
==52== To do this outrage, and it now is done.

**SAT.**
==53== What, was she ravish’d? Tell who did the deed.

**TIT.**
==54== Will’t please you eat? Will’t please your Highness feed?

**TAM.**
==55== Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?

**TIT.**
==56== Not I, ’twas Chiron and Demetrius:
==57== They ravish’d her, and cut away her tongue,
==58== And they, ’twas they, that did her all this wrong.

**SAT.**
==59== Go fetch them hither to us presently.

**TIT.**
==60== Why, there they are, both baked in this pie;
==61== Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
==62== Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
==63== ’Tis true, ’tis true, witness my knife’s sharp point.

*He stabs the Empress.*

**SAT.**
==64== Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!

*Kills Titus.*

**LUC.**
==65== Can the son’s eye behold his father bleed?
==66== There’s meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!

*Kills Saturninus. A great tumult.*

*Exeunt Lucius, Marcus, Aemilius, and others and enter above.*

**MARC.**
==67== You sad-fac’d men, people and sons of Rome,
==68== By uproars sever’d, as a flight of fowl
==69== Scatter’d by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
==70== O, let me teach you how to knit again
==71== This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf,
==72== These broken limbs again into one body.

**AEMIL.**
==73== Let Rome herself be bane unto herself,
==74== And she whom mighty kingdoms cur’sy to,
==75== Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
==76== Do shameful execution on herself,
==77== But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
==78== Grave witnesses of true experience,
==79== Cannot induce you to attend my words.
*(To Lucius.)*
==80== Speak, Rome’s dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
==81== When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
==82== To love-sick Dido’s sad attending ear
==83== The story of that baleful burning night,
==84== When subtile Greeks surpris’d King Priam’s Troy.
==85== Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch’d our ears,
==86== Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
==87== That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
==88== My heart is not compact of flint nor steel,
==89== Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
==90== But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
==91== And break my utt’rance, even in the time
==92== When it should move ye to attend me most,
==93== And force you to commiseration.
==94== Here’s Rome’s young captain, let him tell the tale,
==95== While I stand by and weep to hear him speak.

**LUC.**
==96== Then, gracious auditory, be it known to you
==97== That Chiron and the damn’d Demetrius
==98== Were they that murd’red our Emperor’s brother,
==99== And they it were that ravished our sister.
==100== For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded,
==101== Our father’s tears despis’d, and basely cozen’d
==102== Of that true hand that fought Rome’s quarrel out,
==103== And sent her enemies unto the grave.
==104== Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
==105== The gates shut on me, and turn’d weeping out
==106== To beg relief among Rome’s enemies,
==107== Who drown’d their enmity in my true tears,
==108== And op’d their arms to embrace me as a friend.
==109== I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
==110== That have preserv’d her welfare in my blood,
==111== And from her bosom took the enemy’s point,
==112== Sheathing the steel in my advent’rous body.
==113== Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
==114== My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
==115== That my report is just and full of truth.
==116== But soft, methinks I do digress too much,
==117== Citing my worthless praise. O, pardon me,
==118== For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.

**MARC.**
==119== Now is my turn to speak. Behold the child:
*(Pointing to Aaron’s child in the arms of an Attendant.)*
==120== Of this was Tamora delivered,
==121== The issue of an irreligious Moor,
==122== Chief architect and plotter of these woes.
==123== The villain is alive in Titus’ house,
==124== And as he is to witness, this is true.
==125== Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
==126== These wrongs unspeakable, past patience,
==127== Or more than any living man could bear.
==128== Now have you heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
==129== Have we done aught amiss, show us wherein,
==130== And, from the place where you behold us pleading,
==131== The poor remainder of Andronici
==132== Will hand in hand all headlong hurl ourselves,
==133== And on the ragged stones beat forth our souls,
==134== And make a mutual closure of our house.
==135== Speak, Romans, speak, and if you say we shall,
==136== Lo hand in hand Lucius and I will fall.

**AEMIL.**
==137== Come, come, thou reverent man of Rome,
==138== And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand,
==139== Lucius our Emperor, for well I know
==140== The common voice do cry it shall be so.

**ALL.**
==141== Lucius, all hail, Rome’s royal Emperor!

**MARC.**
*(To Attendants.)*
==142== Go, go into old Titus’ sorrowful house,
==143== And hither hale that misbelieving Moor
==144== To be adjudg’d some direful slaught’ring death,
==145== As punishment for his most wicked life.

*Exeunt Attendants*

*Lucius, Marcus, Aemilius, and the others descend.*

**ALL.**
==146== Lucius, all hail, Rome’s gracious governor!

**LUC.**
==147== Thanks, gentle Romans, may I govern so,
==148== To heal Rome’s harms, and wipe away her woe!
==149== But, gentle people, give me aim a while,
==150== For nature puts me to a heavy task.
==151== Stand all aloof, but, uncle, draw you near
==152== To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
==153== O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
*(Kisses Titus.)*
==154== These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain’d face,
==155== The last true duties of thy noble son!

**MARC.**
==156== Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
==157== Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips.
==158== O, were the sum of these that I should pay
==159== Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!

**LUC.**
==160== Come hither, boy, come, come, and learn of us
==161== To melt in showers; thy grandsire lov’d thee well.
==162== Many a time he danc’d thee on his knee,
==163== Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow;
==164== Many a story hath he told to thee,
==165== And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind,
==166== And talk of them when he was dead and gone.

**MARC.**
==167== How many thousand times hath these poor lips,
==168== When they were living, warm’d themselves on thine!
==169== O now, sweet boy, give them their latest kiss!
==170== Bid him farewell, commit him to the grave,
==171== Do them that kindness, and take leave of them.

**Y. LUC.**
==172== O grandsire, grandsire, ev’n with all my heart
==173== Would I were dead, so you did live again!
==174== O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping,
==175== My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth.

*Enter Attendants with Aaron.*

**AEMIL.**
==176== You sad Andronici, have done with woes.
==177== Give sentence on this execrable wretch
==178== That hath been breeder of these dire events.

**LUC.**
==179== Set him breast-deep in earth and famish him,
==180== There let him stand and rave and cry for food.
==181== If any one relieves or pities him,
==182== For the offense he dies. This is our doom.
==183== Some stay to see him fast’ned in the earth.

**AAR.**
==184== Ah, why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?
==185== I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
==186== I should repent the evils I have done.
==187== Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
==188== Would I perform if I might have my will.
==189== If one good deed in all my life I did,
==190== I do repent it from my very soul.

**LUC.**
==191== Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence,
==192== And give him burial in his fathers’ grave.
==193== My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
==194== Be closed in our household’s monument.
==195== As for that ravenous tiger Tamora,
==196== No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weed,
==197== No mournful bell shall ring her burial,
==198== But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey:
==199== Her life was beastly and devoid of pity,
==200== And being dead, let birds on her take pity.

*Exeunt.*
