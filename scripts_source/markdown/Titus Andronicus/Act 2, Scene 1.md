## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Rome. Before the Palace.*

*Aaron the Moor alone.*

**AAR.**
==1==Now climbeth Tamora Olympus’ top,
==2==Safe out of fortune’s shot, and sits aloft,
==3==Secure of thunder’s crack or lightning flash,
==4==Advanc’d above pale envy’s threat’ning reach.
==5==As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
==6==And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
==7==Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,
==8==And overlooks the highest-peering hills:
==9==So Tamora.
==10==Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait,
==11==And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown;
==12==Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,
==13==To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
==14==And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
==15==Hast prisoner held, fett’red in amorous chains,
==16==And faster bound to Aaron’s charming eyes
==17==Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
==18==Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
==19==I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,
==20==To wait upon this new-made emperess.
==21==To wait, said I? To wanton with this queen,
==22==This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
==23==This siren that will charm Rome’s Saturnine,
==24==And see his shipwreck and his commonweal’s.
==25==Hollo, what storm is this?

*Enter Chiron and Demetrius braving.*

**DEM.**
==26==Chiron, thy years wants wit, thy wits wants edge,
==27==And manners, to intrude where I am grac’d,
==28==And may, for aught thou knowest, affected be.

**CHI.**
==29==Demetrius, thou dost overween in all,
==30==And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
==31==’Tis not the difference of a year or two
==32==Makes me less gracious, or thee more fortunate;
==33==I am as able and as fit as thou
==34==To serve, and to deserve my mistress’ grace,
==35==And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
==36==And plead my passions for Lavinia’s love.

**AAR.**
*(Aside.)*
==37==Clubs, clubs! These lovers will not keep the peace.

**DEM.**
==38==Why, boy, although our mother, unadvis’d,
==39==Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
==40==Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?
==41==Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath,
==42==Till you know better how to handle it.

**CHI.**
==43==Mean while, sir, with the little skill I have,
==44==Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.

**DEM.**
==45==Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?

*They draw.*

**AAR.**
*(Coming forward.)*
==45==                Why, how now, lords?
==46==So near the Emperor’s palace dare ye draw,
==47==And maintain such a quarrel openly?
==48==Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge.
==49==I would not for a million of gold
==50==The cause were known to them it most concerns,
==51==Nor would your noble mother for much more
==52==Be so dishonored in the court of Rome.
==53==For shame, put up.

**DEM.**
==53==           Not I, till I have sheath’d
==54==My rapier in his bosom, and withal
==55==Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat,
==56==That he hath breath’d in my dishonor here.

**CHI.**
==57==For that I am prepar’d and full resolv’d,
==58==Foul-spoken coward, that thund’rest with thy tongue,
==59==And with thy weapon nothing dar’st perform!

**AAR.**
==60==Away, I say!
==61==Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
==62==This petty brabble will undo us all.
==63==Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
==64==It is to jet upon a prince’s right?
==65==What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
==66==Or Bassianus so degenerate,
==67==That for her love such quarrels may be broach’d,
==68==Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
==69==Young lords, beware! And should the Empress know
==70==This discord’s ground, the music would not please.

**CHI.**
==71==I care not, I, knew she and all the world,
==72==I love Lavinia more than all the world.

**DEM.**
==73==Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice,
==74==Lavinia is thine elder brother’s hope.

**AAR.**
==75==Why, are ye mad? Or know ye not, in Rome
==76==How furious and impatient they be,
==77==And cannot brook competitors in love?
==78==I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
==79==By this device.

**CHI.**
==79==        Aaron, a thousand deaths
==80==Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.

**AAR.**
==81==To achieve her how?

**DEM.**
==81==           Why makes thou it so strange?
==82==She is a woman, therefore may be woo’d,
==83==She is a woman, therefore may be won,
==84==She is Lavinia, therefore must be lov’d.
==85==What, man, more water glideth by the mill
==86==Than wots the miller of, and easy it is
==87==Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.
==88==Though Bassianus be the Emperor’s brother,
==89==Better than he have worn Vulcan’s badge.

**AAR.**
*(Aside.)*
==90==Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.

**DEM.**
==91==Then why should he despair that knows to court it,
==92==With words, fair looks, and liberality?
==93==What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
==94==And borne her cleanly by the keeper’s nose?

**AAR.**
==95==Why then it seems some certain snatch or so
==96==Would serve your turns.

**CHI.**
==96==              Ay, so the turn were served.

**DEM.**
==97==Aaron, thou hast hit it.

**AAR.**
==98==Would you had hit it too!
==99==Then should not we be tir’d with this ado.
==100==Why, hark ye, hark ye, and are you such fools
==101==To square for this? Would it offend you then
==102==That both should speed?

**CHI.**
==103==Faith, not me.

**DEM.**
==103==        Nor me, so I were one.

**AAR.**
==104==For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.
==105==’Tis policy and stratagem must do
==106==That you affect, and so must you resolve,
==107==That what you cannot as you would achieve,
==108==You must perforce accomplish as you may.
==109==Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
==110==Than this Lavinia, Bassianus’ love.
==111==A speedier course than ling’ring languishment
==112==Must we pursue, and I have found the path:
==113==My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand,
==114==There will the lovely Roman ladies troop;
==115==The forest walks are wide and spacious,
==116==And many unfrequented plots there are,
==117==Fitted by kind for rape and villainy.
==118==Single you thither then this dainty doe,
==119==And strike her home by force, if not by words;
==120==This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
==121==Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
==122==To villainy and vengeance consecrate,
==123==Will we acquaint withal what we intend,
==124==And she shall file our engines with advice,
==125==That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
==126==But to your wishes’ height advance you both.
==127==The Emperor’s court is like the house of Fame,
==128==The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears;
==129==The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.
==130==There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns,
==131==There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven’s eye,
==132==And revel in Lavinia’s treasury.

**CHI.**
==133==Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.

**DEM.**
==134==*Sit fas aut nefas*, till I find the stream
==135==To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits,
==136==*Per Stygia, per manes vehor*.

*Exeunt.*
