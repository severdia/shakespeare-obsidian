## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*A lonely part of the forest.*

*Enter Aaron alone with a bag of gold.*

**AAR.**
==1==He that had wit would think that I had none,
==2==To bury so much gold under a tree,
==3==And never after to inherit it.
==4==Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
==5==Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
==6==Which cunningly effected will beget
==7==A very excellent piece of villainy.
==8==And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest,
*(Hides the gold.)*
==9==That have their alms out of the Empress’ chest.

*Enter Tamora alone to the Moor.*

**TAM.**
==10==My lovely Aaron, wherefore look’st thou sad,
==11==When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
==12==The birds chaunt melody on every bush,
==13==The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,
==14==The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
==15==And make a checker’d shadow on the ground.
==16==Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
==17==And whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
==18==Replying shrilly to the well-tun’d horns,
==19==As if a double hunt were heard at once,
==20==Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise;
==21==And after conflict such as was suppos’d
==22==The wand’ring prince and Dido once enjoyed,
==23==When with a happy storm they were surpris’d,
==24==And curtain’d with a counsel-keeping cave,
==25==We may, each wreathed in the other’s arms
==26==(Our pastimes done), possess a golden slumber,
==27==Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
==28==Be unto us as is a nurse’s song
==29==Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.

**AAR.**
==30==Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
==31==Saturn is dominator over mine:
==32==What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
==33==My silence, an’ my cloudy melancholy,
==34==My fleece of wooly hair that now uncurls,
==35==Even as an adder when she doth unroll
==36==To do some fatal execution?
==37==No, madam, these are no venereal signs.
==38==Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
==39==Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
==40==Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,
==41==Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
==42==This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
==43==His Philomel must lose her tongue today,
==44==Thy sons make pillage of her chastity,
==45==And wash their hands in Bassianus’ blood.
==46==Seest thou this letter? Take it up, I pray thee,
==47==And give the King this fatal-plotted scroll.
==48==Now question me no more, we are espied.
==49==Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
==50==Which dreads not yet their lives’ destruction.

*Enter Bassianus and Lavinia.*

**TAM.**
==51==Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!

**AAR.**
==52==No more, great Empress, Bassianus comes.
==53==Be cross with him, and I’ll go fetch thy sons
==54==To back thy quarrels, whatsoe’er they be.

*Exit.*

**BAS.**
==55==Who have we here? Rome’s royal Emperess,
==56==Unfurnish’d of her well-beseeming troop?
==57==Or is it Dian habited like her,
==58==Who hath abandoned her holy groves
==59==To see the general hunting in this forest?

**TAM.**
==60==Saucy controller of my private steps!
==61==Had I the pow’r that some say Dian had,
==62==Thy temples should be planted presently
==63==With horns, as was Actaeon’s, and the hounds
==64==Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
==65==Unmannerly intruder as thou art!

**LAV.**
==66==Under your patience, gentle Emperess,
==67==’Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning,
==68==And to be doubted that your Moor and you
==69==Are singled forth to try thy experiments.
==70==Jove shield your husband from his hounds today!
==71==’Tis pity they should take him for a stag.

**BAS.**
==72==Believe me, Queen, your swart Cimmeriant
==73==Doth make your honor of his body’s hue,
==74==Spotted, detested, and abominable.
==75==Why are you sequest’red from all your train,
==76==Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,
==77==And wand’red hither to an obscure plot,
==78==Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
==79==If foul desire had not conducted you?

**LAV.**
==80==And, being intercepted in your sport,
==81==Great reason that my noble lord be rated
==82==For sauciness. I pray you let us hence,
==83==And let her joy her raven-colored love;
==84==This valley fits the purpose passing well.

**BAS.**
==85==The King my brother shall have notice of this.

**LAV.**
==86==Ay, for these slips have made him noted long,
==87==Good king, to be so mightily abused.

**TAM.**
==88==Why, I have patience to endure all this.

*Enter Chiron and Demetrius.*

**DEM.**
==89==How now, dear sovereign and our gracious mother?
==90==Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan?

**TAM.**
==91==Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
==92==These two have ’ticed me hither to this place:
==93==A barren detested vale you see it is;
==94==The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
==95==Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe;
==96==Here never shines the sun, here nothing breeds,
==97==Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven;
==98==And when they show’d me this abhorred pit,
==99==They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
==100==A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
==101==Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
==102==Would make such fearful and confused cries,
==103==As any mortal body hearing it
==104==Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
==105==No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
==106==But straight they told me they would bind me here
==107==Unto the body of a dismal yew,
==108==And leave me to this miserable death.
==109==And then they call’d me foul adulteress,
==110==Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
==111==That ever ear did hear to such effect;
==112==And had you not by wondrous fortune come,
==113==This vengeance on me had they executed:
==114==Revenge it, as you love your mother’s life,
==115==Or be ye not henceforth call’d my children.

**DEM.**
==116==This is a witness that I am thy son.

*Stabs him.*

**CHI.**
==117==And this for me, struck home to show my strength.

*Also stabs Bassianus, who dies.*

**LAV.**
==118==Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,
==119==For no name fits thy nature but thy own!

**TAM.**
==120==Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys,
==121==Your mother’s hand shall right your mother’s wrong.

**DEM.**
==122==Stay, madam, here is more belongs to her:
==123==First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.
==124==This minion stood upon her chastity,
==125==Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
==126==And with that painted hope braves your mightiness;
==127==And shall she carry this unto her grave?

**CHI.**
==128==And if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
==129==Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
==130==And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.

**TAM.**
==131==But when ye have the honey we desire,
==132==Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.

**CHI.**
==133==I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
==134==Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
==135==That nice-preserved honesty of yours.

**LAV.**
==136==O Tamora, thou bearest a woman’s face⁠—

**TAM.**
==137==I will not hear her speak, away with her!

**LAV.**
==138==Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.

**DEM.**
==139==Listen, fair madam, let it be your glory
==140==To see her tears, but be your heart to them
==141==As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.

**LAV.**
==142==When did the tiger’s young ones teach the dam?
==143==O, do not learn her wrath—she taught it thee;
==144==The milk thou suck’st from her did turn to marble,
==145==Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny;
==146==Yet every mother breeds not sons alike⁠—
*(To Chiron.)*
==147==Do thou entreat her show a woman’s pity.

**CHI.**
==148==What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?

**LAV.**
==149==’Tis true, the raven doth not hatch a lark,
==150==Yet have I heard—O, could I find it now!⁠—
==151==The lion, mov’d with pity, did endure
==152==To have his princely paws par’d all away.
==153==Some say that ravens foster forlorn children
==154==The whilst their own birds famish in their nests;
==155==O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
==156==Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!

**TAM.**
==157==I know not what it means, away with her!

**LAV.**
==158==O, let me teach thee! For my father’s sake,
==159==That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee,
==160==Be not obdurate, open thy deaf years.

**TAM.**
==161==Hadst thou in person ne’er offended me,
==162==Even for his sake am I pitiless.
==163==Remember, boys, I pour’d forth tears in vain
==164==To save your brother from the sacrifice,
==165==But fierce Andronicus would not relent.
==166==Therefore away with her, and use her as you will;
==167==The worse to her, the better lov’d of me.

**LAV.**
==168==O Tamora, be call’d a gentle queen,
==169==And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
==170==For ’tis not life that I have begg’d so long,
==171==Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.

**TAM.**
==172==What beg’st thou then? Fond woman, let me go.

**LAV.**
==173==’Tis present death I beg, and one thing more
==174==That womanhood denies my tongue to tell.
==175==O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
==176==And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
==177==Where never man’s eye may behold my body:
==178==Do this, and be a charitable murderer.

**TAM.**
==179==So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee.
==180==No, let them satisfice their lust on thee.

**DEM.**
==181==Away, for thou hast stay’d us here too long.

**LAV.**
==182==No grace? No womanhood? Ah, beastly creature,
==183==The blot and enemy to our general name!
==184==Confusion fall⁠—

**CHI.**
==185==Nay then I’ll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband;
==186==This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.

*Demetrius throws the body of Bassianus into the pit.*

*Then exeunt Demetrius and Chiron dragging off Lavinia.*

**TAM.**
==187==Farewell, my sons, see that you make her sure.
==188==Ne’er let my heart know merry cheer indeed
==189==Till all the Andronici be made away.
==190==Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
==191==And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow’r.

*Exit.*

*Enter Aaron with two of Titus’ sons, Quintus and Martius.*

**AAR.**
==192==Come on, my lords, the better foot before.
==193==Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
==194==Where I espied the panther fast asleep.

**QUIN.**
==195==My sight is very dull, what e’er it bodes.

**MART.**
==196==And mine, I promise you; were it not for shame,
==197==Well could I leave our sport to sleep a while.

*Falls into the pit.*

**QUIN.**
==198==What, art thou fallen? What subtile hole is this,
==199==Whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers,
==200==Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
==201==As fresh as morning dew distill’d on flowers?
==202==A very fatal place it seems to me.
==203==Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

**MART.**
==204==O brother, with the dismall’st object hurt
==205==That ever eye with sight made heart lament!

**AAR.**
*(Aside.)*
==206==Now will I fetch the King to find them here,
==207==That he thereby may have a likely guess,
==208==How these were they that made away his brother.

*Exit.*

**MART.**
==209==Why dost not comfort me and help me out
==210==From this unhallow’d and blood-stained hole?

**QUIN.**
==211==I am surprised with an uncouth fear,
==212==A chilling sweat o’erruns my trembling joints,
==213==My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.

**MART.**
==214==To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
==215==Aaron and thou look down into this den,
==216==And see a fearful sight of blood and death.

**QUIN.**
==217==Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart
==218==Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
==219==The thing whereat it trembles by surmise.
==220==O, tell me who it is, for ne’er till now
==221==Was I a child to fear I know not what.

**MART.**
==222==Lord Bassianus lies beray’d in blood,
==223==All on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,
==224==In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.

**QUIN.**
==225==If it be dark, how dost thou know ’tis he?

**MART.**
==226==Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
==227==A precious ring that lightens all this hole,
==228==Which, like a taper in some monument,
==229==Doth shine upon the dead man’s earthy cheeks,
==230==And shows the ragged entrails of this pit:
==231==So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
==232==When he by night lay bath’d in maiden blood.
==233==O brother, help me with thy fainting hand⁠—
==234==If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath⁠—
==235==Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
==236==As hateful as Cocytus’ misty mouth.

**QUIN.**
==237==Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out,
==238==Or wanting strength to do thee so much good,
==239==I may be pluck’d into the swallowing womb
==240==Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus’ grave.
==241==I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.

**MART.**
==242==Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.

**QUIN.**
==243==Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
==244==Till thou art here aloft or I below.
==245==Thou canst not come to me—I come to thee.

*Falls in.*

*Enter the Emperor and Aaron the Moor.*

**SAT.**
==246==Along with me! I’ll see what hole is here,
==247==And what he is that now is leapt into it.
==248==Say who art thou that lately didst descend
==249==Into this gaping hollow of the earth?

**MART.**
==250==The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,
==251==Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
==252==To find thy brother Bassianus dead.

**SAT.**
==253==My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest.
==254==He and his lady both are at the lodge,
==255==Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
==256==’Tis not an hour since I left them there.

**MART.**
==257==We know not where you left them all alive,
==258==But out alas, here have we found him dead.

*Enter Tamora with Attendants, Titus Andronicus, and Lucius.*

**TAM.**
==259==Where is my lord the King?

**SAT.**
==260==Here, Tamora, though griev’d with killing grief.

**TAM.**
==261==Where is thy brother Bassianus?

**SAT.**
==262==Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound;
==263==Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.

**TAM.**
==264==Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
==265==The complot of this timeless tragedy,
==266==And wonder greatly that man’s face can fold
==267==In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.

*She giveth Saturnine a letter.*

**SAT.**
*(Reads the letter.)*
==268==*“And if we miss to meet him handsomely,*
==269==*Sweet huntsman—Bassianus ’tis we mean—*
==270==*Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:*
==271==*Thou know’st our meaning. Look for thy reward*
==272==*Among the nettles at the elder-tree,*
==273==*Which overshades the mouth of that same pit*
==274==*Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.*
==275==*Do this and purchase us thy lasting friends.”*
==276==O Tamora, was ever heard the like?
==277==This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
==278==Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out,
==279==That should have murdered Bassianus here.

**AAR.**
==280==My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.

**SAT.**
*(To Titus.)*
==281==Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind,
==282==Have here bereft my brother of his life.⁠—
==283==Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison,
==284==There let them bide until we have devis’d
==285==Some never-heard-of tortering pain for them.

**TAM.**
==286==What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
==287==How easily murder is discovered!

**TIT.**
==288==High Emperor, upon my feeble knee
==289==I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
==290==That this fell fault of my accursed sons⁠—
==291==Accursed, if the fault be prov’d in them⁠—

**SAT.**
==292==If it be prov’d! You see it is apparent.
==293==Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?

**TAM.**
==294==Andronicus himself did take it up.

**TIT.**
==295==I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail,
==296==For by my fathers’ reverent tomb I vow
==297==They shall be ready at your Highness’ will,
==298==To answer their suspicion with their lives.

**SAT.**
==299==Thou shalt not bail them, see thou follow me.
==300==Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers.
==301==Let them not speak a word, the guilt is plain,
==302==For by my soul, were there worse end than death,
==303==That end upon them should be executed.

**TAM.**
==304==Andronicus, I will entreat the King.
==305==Fear not thy sons, they shall do well enough.

**TIT.**
==306==Come, Lucius, come, stay not to talk with them.

*Exeunt.*
