## Act 3, Scene 7
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Florence. The Widow’s house.*

*Enter Helen and Widow.*

**HEL.**
==1==If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
==2==I know not how I shall assure you further
==3==But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

**WID.**
==4==Though my estate be fall’n, I was well born,
==5==Nothing acquainted with these businesses,
==6==And would not put my reputation now
==7==In any staining act.

**HEL.**
==7==           Nor would I wish you.
==8==First give me trust, the Count he is my husband,
==9==And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
==10==Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
==11==By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
==12==Err in bestowing it.

**WID.**
==12==           I should believe you,
==13==For you have show’d me that which well approves
==14==Y’ are great in fortune.

**HEL.**
==14==           Take this purse of gold,
==15==And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
==16==Which I will over-pay and pay again
==17==When I have found it. The Count he woos your daughter,
==18==Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
==19==Resolv’d to carry her. Let her in fine consent,
==20==As we’ll direct her how ’tis best to bear it.
==21==Now his important blood will nought deny
==22==That she’ll demand. A ring the County wears,
==23==That downward hath succeeded in his house
==24==From son to son, some four or five descents,
==25==Since the first father wore it. This ring he holds
==26==In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
==27==To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
==28==Howe’er repented after.

**WID.**
==28==              Now I see
==29==The bottom of your purpose.

**HEL.**
==30==You see it lawful then. It is no more
==31==But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
==32==Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
==33==In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
==34==Herself most chastely absent. After,
==35==To marry her, I’ll add three thousand crowns
==36==To what is pass’d already.

**WID.**
==36==              I have yielded.
==37==Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
==38==That time and place with this deceit so lawful
==39==May prove coherent. Every night he comes
==40==With musics of all sorts, and songs compos’d
==41==To her unworthiness. It nothing steads us
==42==To chide him from our eaves, for he persists
==43==As if his life lay on’t.

**HEL.**
==43==           Why then tonight
==44==Let us assay our plot, which if it speed,
==45==Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed,
==46==And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
==47==Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact.
==48==But let’s about it.

*Exeunt.*
