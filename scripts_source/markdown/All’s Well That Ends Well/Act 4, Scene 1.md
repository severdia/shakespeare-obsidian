## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 7|← Act 3, Scene 7]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Without the Florentine camp.*

*Enter Second French Lord with five or six other Soldiers in ambush.*

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==1==He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will. Though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us, whom we must produce for an interpreter.

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==2==Good captain, let me be th’ interpreter.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==3==Art not acquainted with him? Knows he not thy voice?

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==4==No, sir, I warrant you.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==5==But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==6==E’en such as you speak to me.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==7==He must think us some band of strangers i’ th’ adversary’s entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all neighboring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs’ language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch ho, here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges.

*They stand aside.*

*Enter Parolles.*

**PAR.**
==8==Ten o’clock: within these three hours ’twill be time enough to go home. What shall I say I have done? It must be a very plausive invention that carries it. They begin to smoke me, and disgraces have of late knock’d too often at my door. I find my tongue is too foolhardy, but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it, and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
*(Aside.)*
==9==This is the first truth that e’er thine own tongue was guilty of.

**PAR.**
==10==What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in exploit. Yet slight ones will not carry it. They will say, “Came you off with so little?” And great ones I dare not give; wherefore what’s the instance? Tongue, I must put you into a butter-woman’s mouth and buy myself another of Bajazeth’s mule, if you prattle me into these perils.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
*(Aside.)*
==11==Is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is?

**PAR.**
==12==I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
*(Aside.)*
==13==We cannot afford you so.

**PAR.**
==14==Or the baring of my beard, and to say it was in stratagem.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
*(Aside.)*
==15==’Twould not do.

**PAR.**
==16==Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripp’d.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
*(Aside.)*
==17==Hardly serve.

**PAR.**
==18==Though I swore I leapt from the window of the citadel⁠—

**2. LORD. DUM.**
*(Aside.)*
==19==How deep?

**PAR.**
==20==Thirty fathom.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
*(Aside.)*
==21==Three great oaths would scarce make that be believ’d.

**PAR.**
==22==I would I had any drum of the enemy’s. I would swear I recover’d it.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
*(Aside.)*
==23==You shall hear one anon.

**PAR.**
==24==A drum now of the enemy’s⁠—

*Alarum within.*

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==25==*Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.*

**PAR.**
==26==O, ransom, ransom!
*(They seize him.)*
==27==Do not hide mine eyes.

*They blindfold him.*

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==28==*Boskos thromuldo boskos.*

**PAR.**
==29==I know you are the Muskos’ regiment,
==30==And I shall lose my life for want of language.
==31==If there be here German, or Dane, Low Dutch,
==32==Italian, or French, let him speak to me,
==33==I’ll discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==34==*Boskos vauvado.* I understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. *Kerelybonto*, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.

**PAR.**
==35==O!

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==36==O, pray, pray, pray! *Manka revania dulche.*

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==37==*Oscorbidulchos volivorco.*

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==38==The general is content to spare thee yet,
==39==And hoodwink’d as thou art, will lead thee on
==40==To gather from thee. Haply thou mayst inform
==41==Something to save thy life.

**PAR.**
==41==              O, let me live,
==42==And all the secrets of our camp I’ll show,
==43==Their force, their purposes; nay, I’ll speak that
==44==Which you will wonder at.

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==44==              But wilt thou faithfully?

**PAR.**
==45==If I do not, damn me.

**1. SOLD. AS INTERPRETER.**
==45==           *Acordo linta.*
==46==Come on, thou art granted space,

*Exit with Parolles guarded.*

*A short alarum within.*

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==47==Go tell the Count Roussillon, and my brother,
==48==We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
==49==Till we do hear from them.

**2. SOLD.**
==49==              Captain, I will.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==50==’A will betray us all unto ourselves:
==51==Inform on that.

**2. SOLD.**
==51==        So I will, sir.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==52==Till then I’ll keep him dark and safely lock’d.

*Exeunt.*
