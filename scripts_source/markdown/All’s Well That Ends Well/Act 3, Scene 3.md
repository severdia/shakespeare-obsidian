## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Florence. Before the Duke’s palace.*

*Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, Bertram Count of Roussillon, Drum and Trumpets, Soldiers, Parolles.*

**DUKE.**
The general of our horse thou art, and we,
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
Upon thy promising fortune.

**BER.**
                Sir, it is
A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
We’ll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
To th’ extreme edge of hazard.

**DUKE.**
                Then go thou forth,
And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm
As thy auspicious mistress!

**BER.**
              This very day,
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;
Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

*Exeunt omnes.*
