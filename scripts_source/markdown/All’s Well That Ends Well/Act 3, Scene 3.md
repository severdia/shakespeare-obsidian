[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Florence. Before the Duke’s palace.*

*Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, Bertram Count of Roussillon, Drum and Trumpets, Soldiers, Parolles.*

**DUKE.**
==1== The general of our horse thou art, and we,
==2== Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
==3== Upon thy promising fortune.

**BER.**
==3==                 Sir, it is
==4== A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
==5== We’ll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
==6== To th’ extreme edge of hazard.

**DUKE.**
==6==                 Then go thou forth,
==7== And Fortune play upon thy prosperous helm
==8== As thy auspicious mistress!

**BER.**
==8==               This very day,
==9== Great Mars, I put myself into thy file;
==10== Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
==11== A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

*Exeunt omnes.*
