## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Another room in the King’s palace.*

*Enter Lafew and Bertram.*

**LAF.**
==1== But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.

**BER.**
==2== Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

**LAF.**
==3== You have it from his own deliverance.

**BER.**
==4== And by other warranted testimony.

**LAF.**
==5== Then my dial goes not true. I took this lark for a bunting.

**BER.**
==6== I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in knowledge, and accordingly valiant.

**LAF.**
==7== I have then sinn’d against his experience, and transgress’d against his valor, and my state that way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my heart to repent. Here he comes. I pray you make us friends, I will pursue the amity.

*Enter Parolles.*

**PAR.**
*(To Bertram.)*
==8== These things shall be done, sir.

**LAF.**
==9== Pray you, sir, who’s his tailor?

**PAR.**
==10== Sir!

**LAF.**
==11== O, I know him well, I, sir, he, sir, ’s a good workman, a very good tailor.

**BER.**
*(Aside to Parolles.)*
==12== Is she gone to the King?

**PAR.**
==13== She is.

**BER.**
==14== Will she away tonight?

**PAR.**
==15== As you’ll have her.

**BER.**
==16== I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
==17== Given order for our horses, and tonight,
==18== When I should take possession of the bride,
==19== End ere I do begin.

**LAF.**
==20== A good traveler is something at the latter end of a dinner, but one that lies three thirds, and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.

**BER.**
==21== Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, *monsieur*?

**PAR.**
==22== I know not how I have deserv’d to run into my lord’s displeasure.

**LAF.**
==23== You have made shift to run into’t, boots and spurs and all, like him that leapt into the custard; and out of it you’ll run again, rather than suffer question for your residence.

**BER.**
==24== It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

**LAF.**
==25== And shall do so ever, though I took him at ’s prayers. Fare you well, my lord, and believe this of me: there can be no kernel in this light nut; the soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them tame, and know their natures. Farewell, *monsieur*, I have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand, but we must do good against evil.

*Exit.*

**PAR.**
==26== An idle lord, I swear.

**BER.**
==27== I think so.

**PAR.**
==28== Why, do you not know him?

**BER.**
==29== Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
==30== Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

*Enter Helena.*

**HEL.**
==31== I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
==32== Spoke with the King, and have procur’d his leave
==33== For present parting; only he desires
==34== Some private speech with you.

**BER.**
==34==                 I shall obey his will.
==35== You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
==36== Which holds not color with the time, nor does
==37== The ministration and required office
==38== On my particular. Prepar’d I was not
==39== For such a business; therefore am I found
==40== So much unsettled. This drives me to entreat you
==41== That presently you take your way for home,
==42== And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
==43== For my respects are better than they seem,
==44== And my appointments have in them a need
==45== Greater than shows itself at the first view
==46== To you that know them not. This to my mother.
*(Giving a letter.)*
==47== ’Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
==48== I leave you to your wisdom.

**HEL.**
==48==               Sir, I can nothing say,
==49== But that I am your most obedient servant.

**BER.**
==50== Come, come, no more of that.

**HEL.**
==50==                 And ever shall
==51== With true observance seek to eke out that
==52== Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail’d
==53== To equal my great fortune.

**BER.**
==53==               Let that go.
==54== My haste is very great. Farewell; hie home.

**HEL.**
==55== Pray, sir, your pardon.

**BER.**
==55==            Well, what would you say?

**HEL.**
==56== I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
==57== Nor dare I say ’tis mine; and yet it is;
==58== But like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
==59== What law does vouch mine own.

**BER.**
==59==                 What would you have?

**HEL.**
==60== Something, and scarce so much; nothing indeed.
==61== I would not tell you what I would, my lord.
==62== Faith, yes:
==63== Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

**BER.**
==64== I pray you stay not, but in haste to horse.

**HEL.**
==65== I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

**BER.**
==66== Where are my other men, *monsieur*?—Farewell.
*(Exit Helena.)*
==67== Go thou toward home, where I will never come
==68== Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
==69== Away, and for our flight.

**PAR.**
==70== Bravely, *coraggio*!

*Exeunt.*
