## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Roussillon. The Count’s palace.*

*Enter Countess and Clown.*

**COUNT.**
Come on, sir, I shall now put you to the height of your breeding.

**CLO.**
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught. I know my business is but to the court.

**COUNT.**
To the court! Why, what place make you special, when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

**CLO.**
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court. He that cannot make a leg, put off ’s cap, kiss his hand, and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all men.

**COUNT.**
Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all questions.

**CLO.**
It is like a barber’s chair that fits all buttocks: the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn-buttock, or any buttock.

**COUNT.**
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

**CLO.**
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your French crown for your taffety punk, as Tib’s rush for Tom’s forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave, as the nun’s lip to the friar’s mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.

**COUNT.**
Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all questions?

**CLO.**
From below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question.

**COUNT.**
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands.

**CLO.**
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it. Here it is, and all that belongs to’t. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn.

**COUNT.**
To be young again, if we could, I will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

**CLO.**
O Lord, sir!—There’s a simple putting off. More, more, a hundred of them.

**COUNT.**
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours that loves you.

**CLO.**
O Lord, sir!—Thick, thick, spare not me.

**COUNT.**
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

**CLO.**
O Lord, sir!—Nay, put me to’t, I warrant you.

**COUNT.**
You were lately whipt, sir, as I think.

**CLO.**
O Lord, sir!—Spare not me.

**COUNT.**
Do you cry, “O Lord, sir!” at your whipping, and “Spare not me”? Indeed your “O Lord, sir!” is very sequent to your whipping; you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.

**CLO.**
I ne’er had worse luck in my life in my “O Lord, sir!” I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

**COUNT.**
I play the noble huswife with the time,
To entertain it so merrily with a fool.

**CLO.**
O Lord, sir!—Why, there’t serves well again.

**COUNT.**
An end, sir; to your business: give Helen this,
And urge her to a present answer back.
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son.
This is not much.

**CLO.**
Not much commendation to them.

**COUNT.**
Not much employment for you. You understand me?

**CLO.**
Most fruitfully, I am there before my legs.

**COUNT.**
Haste you again.

*Exeunt.*
