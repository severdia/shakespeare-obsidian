## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Florence. The Widow’s house.*

*Enter Helen, Widow, and Diana.*

**HEL.**
==1==That you may well perceive I have not wrong’d you,
==2==One of the greatest in the Christian world
==3==Shall be my surety; ’fore whose throne ’tis needful,
==4==Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel.
==5==Time was, I did him a desired office,
==6==Dear almost as his life, which gratitude
==7==Through flinty Tartar’s bosom would peep forth,
==8==And answer thanks. I duly am inform’d
==9==His Grace is at Marsellis, to which place
==10==We have convenient convoy. You must know
==11==I am supposed dead. The army breaking,
==12==My husband hies him home, where heaven aiding,
==13==And by the leave of my good lord the King,
==14==We’ll be before our welcome.

**WID.**
==14==                Gentle madam,
==15==You never had a servant to whose trust
==16==Your business was more welcome.

**HEL.**
==16==                  Nor you, mistress,
==17==Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labor
==18==To recompense your love. Doubt not but heaven
==19==Hath brought me up to be your daughter’s dower,
==20==As it hath fated her to be my motive
==21==And helper to a husband. But O, strange men,
==22==That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
==23==When saucy trusting of the cozen’d thoughts
==24==Defiles the pitchy night; so lust doth play
==25==With what it loathes for that which is away⁠—
==26==But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
==27==Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
==28==Something in my behalf.

**DIA.**
==28==              Let death and honesty
==29==Go with your impositions, I am yours
==30==Upon your will to suffer.

**HEL.**
==30==              Yet, I pray you:
==31==But with the word the time will bring on summer,
==32==When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
==33==And be as sweet as sharp. We must away:
==34==Our wagon is prepar’d, and time revives us.
==35==All’s well that ends well! Still the fine’s the crown;
==36==What e’er the course, the end is the renown.

*Exeunt.*
