## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Florence. The Duke’s palace.*

*Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, the two French Lords, with a troop of soldiers.*

**DUKE.**
So that from point to point now have you heard
The fundamental reasons of this war,
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
           Holy seems the quarrel
Upon your Grace’s part; black and fearful
On the opposer.

**DUKE.**
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
                Good my lord,
The reasons of our state I cannot yield
But like a common and an outward man
That the great figure of a council frames
By self-unable motion, therefore dare not
Say what I think of it, since I have found
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
As often as I guess’d.

**DUKE.**
           Be it his pleasure.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
But I am sure the younger of our nature,
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
Come here for physic.

**DUKE.**
           Welcome shall they be;
And all the honors that can fly from us
Shall on them settle.—You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell.
Tomorrow to th’ field.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
