## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Florence. The Duke’s palace.*

*Flourish. Enter the Duke of Florence, the two French Lords, with a troop of soldiers.*

**DUKE.**
==1==So that from point to point now have you heard
==2==The fundamental reasons of this war,
==3==Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
==4==And more thirsts after.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==4==           Holy seems the quarrel
==5==Upon your Grace’s part; black and fearful
==6==On the opposer.

**DUKE.**
==7==Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
==8==Would in so just a business shut his bosom
==9==Against our borrowing prayers.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==9==                Good my lord,
==10==The reasons of our state I cannot yield
==11==But like a common and an outward man
==12==That the great figure of a council frames
==13==By self-unable motion, therefore dare not
==14==Say what I think of it, since I have found
==15==Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
==16==As often as I guess’d.

**DUKE.**
==16==           Be it his pleasure.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==17==But I am sure the younger of our nature,
==18==That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
==19==Come here for physic.

**DUKE.**
==19==           Welcome shall they be;
==20==And all the honors that can fly from us
==21==Shall on them settle.—You know your places well;
==22==When better fall, for your avails they fell.
==23==Tomorrow to th’ field.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
