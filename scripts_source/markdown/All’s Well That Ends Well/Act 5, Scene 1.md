## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Marseilles. A street.*

*Enter Helen, Widow, and Diana, with two Attendants.*

**HEL.**
==1== But this exceeding posting day and night
==2== Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it.
==3== But since you have made the days and nights as one,
==4== To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
==5== Be bold you do so grow in my requital
==6== As nothing can unroot you.
*(Enter a Gentleman, an astringer.)*
==6==                 In happy time!
==7== This man may help me to his Majesty’s ear,
==8== If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.

**GENT.**
==9== And you.

**HEL.**
==10== Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.

**GENT.**
==11== I have been sometimes there.

**HEL.**
==12== I do presume, sir, that you are not fall’n
==13== From the report that goes upon your goodness,
==14== And therefore goaded with most sharp occasions,
==15== Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
==16== The use of your own virtues, for the which
==17== I shall continue thankful.

**GENT.**
==17==               What’s your will?

**HEL.**
==18== That it will please you
==19== To give this poor petition to the King,
==20== And aid me with that store of power you have
==21== To come into his presence.

**GENT.**
==22== The King’s not here.

**HEL.**
==22==            Not here, sir?

**GENT.**
==22==                      Not indeed.
==23== He hence remov’d last night, and with more haste
==24== Than is his use.

**WID.**
==24==            Lord, how we lose our pains!

**HEL.**
==25== All’s well that ends well yet,
==26== Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
==27== I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

**GENT.**
==28== Marry, as I take it, to Roussillon,
==29== Whither I am going.

**HEL.**
==29==            I do beseech you, sir,
==30== Since you are like to see the King before me,
==31== Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
==32== Which I presume shall render you no blame,
==33== But rather make you thank your pains for it.
==34== I will come after you with what good speed
==35== Our means will make us means.

**GENT.**
==35==                   This I’ll do for you.

**HEL.**
==36== And you shall find yourself to be well thank’d,
==37== What e’er falls more. We must to horse again.
==38== Go, go, provide.

*Exeunt.*
