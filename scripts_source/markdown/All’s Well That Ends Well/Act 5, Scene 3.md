## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Epilogue|Epilogue →]]

*Roussillon. The Count’s palace.*

*Flourish. Enter King, old Lady Countess, Lafew, the two French Lords, with Attendants.*

**KING.**
==1==We lost a jewel of her, and our esteem
==2==Was made much poorer by it; but your son,
==3==As mad in folly, lack’d the sense to know
==4==Her estimation home.

**COUNT.**
==4==              ’Tis past, my liege,
==5==And I beseech your Majesty to make it
==6==Natural rebellion, done i’ th’ blade of youth,
==7==When oil and fire, too strong for reason’s force,
==8==O’erbears it, and burns on.

**KING.**
==8==                My honor’d lady,
==9==I have forgiven and forgotten all,
==10==Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
==11==And watch’d the time to shoot.

**LAF.**
==11==                This I must say⁠—
==12==But first I beg my pardon—the young lord
==13==Did to his Majesty, his mother, and his lady
==14==Offense of mighty note; but to himself
==15==The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
==16==Whose beauty did astonish the survey
==17==Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
==18==Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn’d to serve
==19==Humbly call’d mistress.

**KING.**
==19==              Praising what is lost
==20==Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither,
==21==We are reconcil’d, and the first view shall kill
==22==All repetition. Let him not ask our pardon,
==23==The nature of his great offense is dead,
==24==And deeper than oblivion we do bury
==25==Th’ incensing relics of it. Let him approach
==26==A stranger, no offender; and inform him
==27==So ’tis our will he should.

**GENT.**
==27==              I shall, my liege.

*Exit.*

**KING.**
==28==What says he to your daughter? Have you spoke?

**LAF.**
==29==All that he is hath reference to your Highness.

**KING.**
==30==Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
==31==That sets him high in fame.

*Enter Count Bertram.*

**LAF.**
==31==                He looks well on’t.

**KING.**
==32==I am not a day of season,
==33==For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
==34==In me at once. But to the brightest beams
==35==Distracted clouds give way, so stand thou forth,
==36==The time is fair again.

**BER.**
==36==           My high-repented blames,
==37==Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

**KING.**
==37==                  All is whole,
==38==Not one word more of the consumed time.
==39==Let’s take the instant by the forward top;
==40==For we are old, and on our quick’st decrees
==41==Th’ inaudible and noiseless foot of time
==42==Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
==43==The daughter of this lord?

**BER.**
==44==Admiringly, my liege. At first
==45==I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
==46==Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue;
==47==Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
==48==Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
==49==Which warp’d the line of every other favor,
==50==Scorn’d a fair color, or express’d it stol’n,
==51==Extended or contracted all proportions
==52==To a most hideous object. Thence it came
==53==That she whom all men prais’d, and whom myself,
==54==Since I have lost, have lov’d, was in mine eye
==55==The dust that did offend it.

**KING.**
==55==                Well excus’d.
==56==That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
==57==From the great compt; but love that comes too late,
==58==Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
==59==To the great sender turns a sour offense,
==60==Crying, “That’s good that’s gone.” Our rash faults
==61==Make trivial price of serious things we have,
==62==Not knowing them until we know their grave.
==63==Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
==64==Destroy our friends, and after weep their dust;
==65==Our own love waking cries to see what’s done,
==66==While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon.
==67==Be this sweet Helen’s knell, and now forget her.
==68==Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin.
==69==The main consents are had, and here we’ll stay
==70==To see our widower’s second marriage-day.

**COUNT.**
==71==Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
==72==Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

**LAF.**
==73==Come on, my son, in whom my house’s name
==74==Must be digested; give a favor from you
==75==To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
==76==That she may quickly come.
*(Bertram gives a ring.)*
==76==                By my old beard,
==77==And ev’ry hair that’s on’t, Helen, that’s dead,
==78==Was a sweet creature; such a ring as this,
==79==The last that e’er I took her leave at court,
==80==I saw upon her finger.

**BER.**
==80==           Hers it was not.

**KING.**
==81==Now pray you let me see it; for mine eye,
==82==While I was speaking, oft was fasten’d to’t.
==83==This ring was mine, and when I gave it Helen,
==84==I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
==85==Necessitied to help, that by this token
==86==I would relieve her. Had you that craft to reave her
==87==Of what should stead her most?

**BER.**
==87==                My gracious sovereign,
==88==Howe’er it pleases you to take it so,
==89==The ring was never hers.

**COUNT.**
==89==              Son, on my life,
==90==I have seen her wear it, and she reckon’d it
==91==At her live’s rate.

**LAF.**
==91==        I am sure I saw her wear it.

**BER.**
==92==You are deceiv’d, my lord, she never saw it.
==93==In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
==94==Wrapp’d in a paper, which contain’d the name
==95==Of her that threw it. Noble she was, and thought
==96==I stood engag’d; but when I had subscrib’d
==97==To mine own fortune, and inform’d her fully
==98==I could not answer in that course of honor
==99==As she had made the overture, she ceas’d
==100==In heavy satisfaction, and would never
==101==Receive the ring again.

**KING.**
==101==              Plutus himself,
==102==That knows the tinct and multiplying med’cine,
==103==Hath not in nature’s mystery more science
==104==Than I have in this ring. ’Twas mine, ’twas Helen’s,
==105==Whoever gave it you. Then if you know
==106==That you are well acquainted with yourself,
==107==Confess ’twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
==108==You got it from her. She call’d the saints to surety
==109==That she would never put it from her finger,
==110==Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
==111==Where you have never come, or sent it us
==112==Upon her great disaster.

**BER.**
==112==              She never saw it.

**KING.**
==113==Thou speak’st it falsely, as I love mine honor,
==114==And mak’st conjectural fears to come into me,
==115==Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
==116==That thou art so inhuman—’twill not prove so;
==117==And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
==118==And she is dead, which nothing but to close
==119==Her eyes myself could win me to believe,
==120==More than to see this ring. Take him away.
*(Guards seize Bertram.)*
==121==My fore-past proofs, howe’er the matter fall,
==122==Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
==123==Having vainly fear’d too little. Away with him!
==124==We’ll sift this matter further.

**BER.**
==124==                If you shall prove
==125==This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
==126==Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
==127==Where yet she never was.

*Exit guarded.*

*Enter a Gentleman, the astringer.*

**KING.**
==128==I am wrapp’d in dismal thinkings.

**GENT.**
==128==                  Gracious sovereign,
==129==Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not.
==130==Here’s a petition from a Florentine,
==131==Who hath for four or five removes come short
==132==To tender it herself. I undertook it,
==133==Vanquish’d thereto by the fair grace and speech
==134==Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
==135==Is here attending. Her business looks in her
==136==With an importing visage, and she told me,
==137==In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
==138==Your Highness with herself.

**KING.**
*(Reads a letter.)*
==139==*“Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won me. Now is the Count Roussillon a widower, his vows are forfeited to me, and my honor’s paid to him. He stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow him to his country for justice. Grant it me, O King, in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. Diana Capilet.”*

**LAF.**
==140==I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this. I’ll none of him.

**KING.**
==141==The heavens have thought well on thee, Lafew,
==142==To bring forth this discov’ry. Seek these suitors.
==143==Go speedily, and bring again the Count.
*(Exeunt some Attendants.)*
==144==I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
==145==Was foully snatch’d.

**COUNT.**
==145==           Now, justice on the doers!

*Enter Bertram guarded.*

**KING.**
==146==I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
==147==And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
==148==Yet you desire to marry. What woman’s that?

*Enter Widow, Diana.*

**DIA.**
==149==I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
==150==Derived from the ancient Capilet.
==151==My suit, as I do understand, you know,
==152==And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

**WID.**
==153==I am her mother, sir, whose age and honor
==154==Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
==155==And both shall cease, without your remedy.

**KING.**
==156==Come hither, Count, do you know these women?

**BER.**
==157==My lord, I neither can nor will deny
==158==But that I know them. Do they charge me further?

**DIA.**
==159==Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

**BER.**
==160==She’s none of mine, my lord.

**DIA.**
==160==                If you shall marry,
==161==You give away this hand, and that is mine;
==162==You give away heaven’s vows, and those are mine;
==163==You give away myself, which is known mine;
==164==For I by vow am so embodied yours,
==165==That she which marries you must marry me,
==166==Either both or none.

**LAF.**
==167==Your reputation comes too short for my daughter, you are no husband for her.

**BER.**
==168==My lord, this is a fond and desp’rate creature,
==169==Whom sometime I have laugh’d with. Let your Highness
==170==Lay a more noble thought upon mine honor
==171==Than for to think that I would sink it here.

**KING.**
==172==Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
==173==Till your deeds gain them; fairer prove your honor
==174==Than in my thought it lies.

**DIA.**
==174==              Good my lord,
==175==Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
==176==He had not my virginity.

**KING.**
==177==What say’st thou to her?

**BER.**
==177==              She’s impudent, my lord,
==178==And was a common gamester to the camp.

**DIA.**
==179==He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
==180==He might have bought me at a common price.
==181==Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
==182==Whose high respect and rich validity
==183==Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
==184==He gave it to a commoner a’ th’ camp,
==185==If I be one.

**COUNT.**
==185==        He blushes, and ’tis hit.
==186==Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
==187==Conferr’d by testament to th’ sequent issue,
==188==Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife,
==189==That ring’s a thousand proofs.

**KING.**
==189==                Methought you said
==190==You saw one here in court could witness it.

**DIA.**
==191==I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
==192==So bad an instrument. His name’s Parolles.

**LAF.**
==193==I saw the man today, if man he be.

**KING.**
==194==Find him, and bring him hither.

*Exit an Attendant.*

**BER.**
==194==                  What of him?
==195==He’s quoted for a most perfidious slave,
==196==With all the spots a’ th’ world tax’d and debosh’d,
==197==Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
==198==Am I or that or this for what he’ll utter,
==199==That will speak any thing?

**KING.**
==199==              She hath that ring of yours.

**BER.**
==200==I think she has. Certain it is I lik’d her,
==201==And boarded her i’ th’ wanton way of youth.
==202==She knew her distance, and did angle for me,
==203==Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
==204==As all impediments in fancy’s course
==205==Are motives of more fancy, and in fine,
==206==Her inf’nite cunning, with her modern grace,
==207==Subdu’d me to her rate. She got the ring,
==208==And I had that which any inferior might
==209==At market-price have bought.

**DIA.**
==209==                I must be patient.
==210==You that have turn’d off a first so noble wife,
==211==May justly diet me. I pray you yet
==212==(Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband) 
==213==Send for your ring, I will return it home,
==214==And give me mine again.

**BER.**
==214==              I have it not.

**KING.**
==215==What ring was yours, I pray you?

**DIA.**
==215==                  Sir, much like
==216==The same upon your finger.

**KING.**
==217==Know you this ring? This ring was his of late.

**DIA.**
==218==And this was it I gave him, being a-bed.

**KING.**
==219==The story then goes false, you threw it him
==220==Out of a casement.

**DIA.**
==220==           I have spoke the truth.

*Enter Parolles.*

**BER.**
==221==My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

**KING.**
==222==You boggle shrewdly, every feather starts you.
==223==Is this the man you speak of?

**DIA.**
==223==                Ay, my lord.

**KING.**
==224==Tell me, sirrah—but tell me true, I charge you,
==225==Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
==226==Which on your just proceeding I’ll keep off⁠—
==227==By him and by this woman here what know you?

**PAR.**
==228==So please your Majesty, my master hath been an honorable gentleman. Tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have.

**KING.**
==229==Come, come, to th’ purpose. Did he love this woman?

**PAR.**
==230==Faith, sir, he did love her, but how?

**KING.**
==231==How, I pray you?

**PAR.**
==232==He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

**KING.**
==233==How is that?

**PAR.**
==234==He lov’d her, sir, and lov’d her not.

**KING.**
==235==As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an equivocal companion is this!

**PAR.**
==236==I am a poor man, and at your Majesty’s command.

**LAF.**
==237==He’s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

**DIA.**
==238==Do you know he promis’d me marriage?

**PAR.**
==239==Faith, I know more than I’ll speak.

**KING.**
==240==But wilt thou not speak all thou know’st?

**PAR.**
==241==Yes, so please your Majesty. I did go between them as I said, but more than that, he lov’d her, for indeed he was mad for her, and talk’d of Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what. Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.

**KING.**
==242==Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married. But thou art too fine in thy evidence, therefore stand aside.
==243==This ring you say was yours?

**DIA.**
==243==                Ay, my good lord.

**KING.**
==244==Where did you buy it? Or who gave it you?

**DIA.**
==245==It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

**KING.**
==246==Who lent it you?

**DIA.**
==246==           It was not lent me neither.

**KING.**
==247==Where did you find it then?

**DIA.**
==247==              I found it not.

**KING.**
==248==If it were yours by none of all these ways,
==249==How could you give it him?

**DIA.**
==249==              I never gave it him.

**LAF.**
==250==This woman’s an easy glove, my lord, she goes off and on at pleasure.

**KING.**
==251==This ring was mine, I gave it his first wife.

**DIA.**
==252==It might be yours or hers for aught I know.

**KING.**
==253==Take her away, I do not like her now,
==254==To prison with her; and away with him.
==255==Unless thou tell’st me where thou hadst this ring,
==256==Thou diest within this hour.

**DIA.**
==256==              I’ll never tell you.

**KING.**
==257==Take her away.

**DIA.**
==257==        I’ll put in bail, my liege.

**KING.**
==258==I think thee now some common customer.

**DIA.**
==259==By Jove, if ever I knew man, ’twas you.

**KING.**
==260==Wherefore hast thou accus’d him all this while?

**DIA.**
==261==Because he’s guilty, and he is not guilty.
==262==He knows I am no maid, and he’ll swear to’t;
==263==I’ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
==264==Great King, I am no strumpet, by my life;
==265==I am either maid, or else this old man’s wife.

*Pointing to Lafew.*

**KING.**
==266==She does abuse our ears. To prison with her!

**DIA.**
==267==Good mother, fetch my bail.
*(Exit Widow.)*
==268==Stay, royal sir.
==269==The jeweler that owes the ring is sent for,
==270==And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
==271==Who hath abus’d me, as he knows himself,
==272==Though yet he never harm’d me, here I quit him.
==273==He knows himself my bed he hath defil’d,
==274==And at that time he got his wife with child.
==275==Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick.
==276==So there’s my riddle: one that’s dead is quick⁠—
==277==And now behold the meaning.

*Enter Widow and Helen.*

**KING.**
==277==                Is there no exorcist
==278==Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
==279==Is’t real that I see?

**HEL.**
==279==           No, my good lord,
==280==’Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
==281==The name, and not the thing.

**BER.**
==281==                Both, both. O, pardon!

**HEL.**
==282==O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
==283==I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring,
==284==And look you, here’s your letter. This it says:
==285==“When from my finger you can get this ring,
==286==And are by me with child, etc.” This is done.
==287==Will you be mine now you are doubly won?

**BER.**
==288==If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
==289==I’ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

**HEL.**
==290==If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
==291==Deadly divorce step between me and you!
==292==O my dear mother, do I see you living?

**LAF.**
==293==Mine eyes smell onions, I shall weep anon.
*(To Parolles.)*
==294==Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher. So, I thank thee; wait on me home, I’ll make sport with thee. Let thy curtsies alone, they are scurvy ones.

**KING.**
==295==Let us from point to point this story know,
==296==To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
*(To Diana.)*
==297==If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower,
==298==Choose thou thy husband, and I’ll pay thy dower,
==299==For I can guess that by thy honest aid
==300==Thou kept’st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
==301==Of that and all the progress, more and less,
==302==Resolvedly more leisure shall express.
==303==All yet seems well, and if it end so meet,
==304==The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

*Flourish.*
