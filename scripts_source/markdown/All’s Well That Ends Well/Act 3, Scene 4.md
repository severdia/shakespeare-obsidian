## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*Roussillon. The Count’s palace.*

*Enter Countess and Steward Rinaldo.*

**COUNT.**
==1==Alas! And would you take the letter of her?
==2==Might you not know she would do as she has done
==3==By sending me a letter? Read it again.

**STEW.**
*(Reads letter.)*
==4==*“I am Saint Jaques’ pilgrim, thither gone.*
==5==*Ambitious love hath so in me offended*
==6==*That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon*
==7==*With sainted vow my faults to have amended.*
==8==*Write, write, that from the bloody course of war*
==9==*My dearest master, your dear son, may hie.*
==10==*Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far*
==11==*His name with zealous fervor sanctify.*
==12==*His taken labors bid him me forgive;*
==13==*I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth*
==14==*From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,*
==15==*Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth.*
==16==*He is too good and fair for death and me,*
==17==*Whom I myself embrace to set him free.”*

**COUNT.**
==18==Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
==19==Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much
==20==As letting her pass so. Had I spoke with her,
==21==I could have well diverted her intents,
==22==Which thus she hath prevented.

**STEW.**
==22==                Pardon me, madam,
==23==If I had given you this at overnight,
==24==She might have been o’erta’en; and yet she writes,
==25==Pursuit would be but vain.

**COUNT.**
==25==              What angel shall
==26==Bless this unworthy husband? He cannot thrive,
==27==Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
==28==And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
==29==Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
==30==To this unworthy husband of his wife.
==31==Let every word weigh heavy of her worth,
==32==That he does weigh too light. My greatest grief,
==33==Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
==34==Dispatch the most convenient messenger.
==35==When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
==36==He will return, and hope I may that she,
==37==Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
==38==Led hither by pure love. Which of them both
==39==Is dearest to me, I have no skill in sense
==40==To make distinction. Provide this messenger.
==41==My heart is heavy, and mine age is weak;
==42==Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

*Exeunt.*
