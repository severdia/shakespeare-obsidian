## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Another room in the King’s palace.*

*Enter Helena and Clown.*

**HEL.**
==1==My mother greets me kindly. Is she well?

**CLO.**
==2==She is not well, but yet she has her health. She’s very merry, but yet she is not well; but thanks be given, she’s very well, and wants nothing i’ th’ world; but yet she is not well.

**HEL.**
==3==If she be very well, what does she ail that she’s not very well?

**CLO.**
==4==Truly, she’s very well indeed, but for two things.

**HEL.**
==5==What two things?

**CLO.**
==6==One, that she’s not in heaven, whither God send her quickly! The other, that she’s in earth, from whence God send her quickly!

*Enter Parolles.*

**PAR.**
==7==Bless you, my fortunate lady!

**HEL.**
==8==I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own good fortunes.

**PAR.**
==9==You had my prayers to lead them on, and to keep them on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?

**CLO.**
==10==So that you had her wrinkles and I her money, I would she did as you say.

**PAR.**
==11==Why, I say nothing.

**CLO.**
==12==Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man’s tongue shakes out his master’s undoing. To say nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to be a great part of your title, which is within a very little of nothing.

**PAR.**
==13==Away, th’ art a knave.

**CLO.**
==14==You should have said, sir, “Before a knave th’ art a knave,” that’s “Before me th’ art a knave.” This had been truth, sir.

**PAR.**
==15==Go to, thou art a witty fool, I have found thee.

**CLO.**
==16==Did you find me in yourself, sir,
*(Parolles nods.)*
==17==or were you taught to find me?
*(Parolles shakes his head.)*
==18==The search, sir, was profitable, and much fool may you find in you, even to the world’s pleasure and the increase of laughter.

**PAR.**
==19==A good knave, i’ faith, and well fed.
==20==Madam, my lord will go away tonight,
==21==A very serious business calls on him.
==22==The great prerogative and rite of love,
==23==Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge,
==24==But puts it off to a compell’d restraint;
==25==Whose want, and whose delay, is strew’d with sweets,
==26==Which they distill now in the curbed time,
==27==To make the coming hour o’erflow with joy,
==28==And pleasure drown the brim.

**HEL.**
==28==                What’s his will else?

**PAR.**
==29==That you will take your instant leave a’ th’ King,
==30==And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
==31==Strength’ned with what apology you think
==32==May make it probable need.

**HEL.**
==32==              What more commands he?

**PAR.**
==33==That having this obtain’d, you presently
==34==Attend his further pleasure.

**HEL.**
==35==In every thing I wait upon his will.

**PAR.**
==36==I shall report it so.

*Exit Parolles.*

**HEL.**
==36==           I pray you. Come, sirrah.

*Exeunt.*
