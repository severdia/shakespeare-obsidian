## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Florence. The Widow’s house.*

*Enter Bertram and the maid called Diana.*

**BER.**
==1==They told me that your name was Fontibell.

**DIA.**
==2==No, my good lord, Diana.

**BER.**
==2==              Titled goddess,
==3==And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
==4==In your fine frame hath love no quality?
==5==If the quick fire of youth light not your mind,
==6==You are no maiden, but a monument.
==7==When you are dead, you should be such a one
==8==As you are now; for you are cold and stern,
==9==And now you should be as your mother was
==10==When your sweet self was got.

**DIA.**
==11==She then was honest.

**BER.**
==11==           So should you be.

**DIA.**
==11==                       No;
==12==My mother did but duty, such, my lord,
==13==As you owe to your wife.

**BER.**
==13==              No more a’ that.
==14==I prithee do not strive against my vows.
==15==I was compell’d to her, but I love thee
==16==By love’s own sweet constraint, and will forever
==17==Do thee all rights of service.

**DIA.**
==17==                Ay, so you serve us
==18==Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
==19==You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves,
==20==And mock us with our bareness.

**BER.**
==20==                  How have I sworn!

**DIA.**
==21==’Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
==22==But the plain single vow that is vow’d true.
==23==What is not holy, that we swear not by,
==24==But take the High’st to witness. Then pray you tell me,
==25==If I should swear by Jove’s great attributes
==26==I lov’d you dearly, would you believe my oaths
==27==When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
==28==To swear by Him whom I protest to love
==29==That I will work against Him; therefore your oaths
==30==Are words and poor conditions, but unseal’d⁠—
==31==At least in my opinion.

**BER.**
==31==              Change it, change it!
==32==Be not so holy-cruel. Love is holy,
==33==And my integrity ne’er knew the crafts
==34==That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
==35==But give thyself unto my sick desires,
==36==Who then recovers. Say thou art mine, and ever
==37==My love, as it begins, shall so persever.

**DIA.**
==38==I see that men make rope’s in such a scarre,
==39==That we’ll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

**BER.**
==40==I’ll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
==41==To give it from me.

**DIA.**
==41==           Will you not, my lord?

**BER.**
==42==It is an honor ’longing to our house,
==43==Bequeathed down from many ancestors,
==44==Which were the greatest obloquy i’ th’ world
==45==In me to lose.

**DIA.**
==45==        Mine honor’s such a ring,
==46==My chastity’s the jewel of our house,
==47==Bequeathed down from many ancestors,
==48==Which were the greatest obloquy i’ th’ world
==49==In me to lose. Thus your own proper wisdom
==50==Brings in the champion Honor on my part,
==51==Against your vain assault.

**BER.**
==51==              Here, take my ring!
==52==My house, mine honor, yea, my life, be thine,
==53==And I’ll be bid by thee.

**DIA.**
==54==When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window;
==55==I’ll order take my mother shall not hear.
==56==Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
==57==When you have conquer’d my yet maiden bed,
==58==Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me.
==59==My reasons are most strong, and you shall know them
==60==When back again this ring shall be deliver’d;
==61==And on your finger in the night I’ll put
==62==Another ring, that what in time proceeds
==63==May token to the future our past deeds.
==64==*Adieu* till then, then fail not. You have won
==65==A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

**BER.**
==66==A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.

*Exit.*

**DIA.**
==67==For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
==68==You may so in the end.
==69==My mother told me just how he would woo,
==70==As if she sate in ’s heart. She says all men
==71==Have the like oaths. He had sworn to marry me
==72==When his wife’s dead; therefore I’ll lie with him
==73==When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
==74==Marry that will, I live and die a maid.
==75==Only in this disguise I think’t no sin
==76==To cozen him that would unjustly win.

*Exit.*
