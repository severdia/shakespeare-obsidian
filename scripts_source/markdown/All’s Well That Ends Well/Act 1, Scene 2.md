## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Paris. The King’s palace.*

*Flourish cornets. Enter the King of France with letters, Lords, and diverse Attendants.*

**KING.**
==1==The Florentines and Senoys are by th’ ears,
==2==Have fought with equal fortune, and continue
==3==A braving war.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==3==        So ’tis reported, sir.

**KING.**
==4==Nay, ’tis most credible; we here receive it
==5==A certainty, vouch’d from our cousin Austria,
==6==With caution, that the Florentine will move us
==7==For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
==8==Prejudicates the business, and would seem
==9==To have us make denial.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==9==              His love and wisdom,
==10==Approv’d so to your Majesty, may plead
==11==For amplest credence.

**KING.**
==11==           He hath arm’d our answer,
==12==And Florence is denied before he comes.
==13==Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see
==14==The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
==15==To stand on either part.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==15==              It well may serve
==16==A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
==17==For breathing and exploit.

**KING.**
==17==              What’s he comes here?

*Enter Bertram, Lafew, and Parolles.*

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==18==It is the Count Roussillon, my good lord,
==19==Young Bertram.

**KING.**
==19==        Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;
==20==Frank Nature, rather curious than in haste,
==21==Hath well compos’d thee. Thy father’s moral parts
==22==Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.

**BER.**
==23==My thanks and duty are your Majesty’s.

**KING.**
==24==I would I had that corporal soundness now
==25==As when thy father and myself in friendship
==26==First tried our soldiership! He did look far
==27==Into the service of the time, and was
==28==Discipled of the bravest. He lasted long,
==29==But on us both did haggish age steal on,
==30==And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
==31==To talk of your good father. In his youth
==32==He had the wit which I can well observe
==33==Today in our young lords; but they may jest
==34==Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
==35==Ere they can hide their levity in honor.
==36==So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
==37==Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
==38==His equal had awak’d them, and his honor,
==39==Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
==40==Exception bid him speak, and at this time
==41==His tongue obey’d his hand. Who were below him
==42==He us’d as creatures of another place,
==43==And bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,
==44==Making them proud of his humility,
==45==In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
==46==Might be a copy to these younger times;
==47==Which followed well, would demonstrate them now
==48==But goers backward.

**BER.**
==48==           His good remembrance, sir,
==49==Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb.
==50==So in approof lives not his epitaph
==51==As in your royal speech.

**KING.**
==52==Would I were with him! He would always say⁠—
==53==Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
==54==He scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them,
==55==To grow there and to bear—“Let me not live”⁠—
==56==This his good melancholy oft began,
==57==On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
==58==When it was out—“Let me not live,” quoth he,
==59==“After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
==60==Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
==61==All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
==62==Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
==63==Expire before their fashions.” This he wish’d.
==64==I, after him, do after him wish too,
==65==Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
==66==I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
==67==To give some laborers room.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==67==              You’re loved, sir;
==68==They that least lend it you shall lack you first.

**KING.**
==69==I fill a place, I know’t. How long is’t, Count,
==70==Since the physician at your father’s died?
==71==He was much fam’d.

**BER.**
==71==           Some six months since, my lord.

**KING.**
==72==If he were living, I would try him yet.⁠—
==73==Lend me an arm.—The rest have worn me out
==74==With several applications. Nature and sickness
==75==Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, Count,
==76==My son’s no dearer.

**BER.**
==76==           Thank your Majesty.

*Exeunt. Flourish.*
