## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Paris. The King’s palace.*

*Enter the King, with diverse young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war, (Bertram) Count Roussillon, and Parolles. Flourish cornets.*

**KING.**
==1==Farewell, young lords, these warlike principles
==2==Do not throw from you; and you, my lords, farewell.
==3==Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain all,
==4==The gift doth stretch itself as ’tis receiv’d,
==5==And is enough for both.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==5==              ’Tis our hope, sir,
==6==After well-ent’red soldiers, to return
==7==And find your Grace in health.

**KING.**
==8==No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
==9==Will not confess he owes the malady
==10==That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords,
==11==Whether I live or die, be you the sons
==12==Of worthy Frenchmen. Let higher Italy
==13==(Those bated that inherit but the fall
==14==Of the last monarchy) see that you come
==15==Not to woo honor, but to wed it, when
==16==The bravest questant shrinks. Find what you seek,
==17==That fame may cry you loud. I say farewell.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==18==Health, at your bidding, serve your Majesty!

**KING.**
==19==Those girls of Italy, take heed of them.
==20==They say our French lack language to deny
==21==If they demand. Beware of being captives
==22==Before you serve.

**BOTH LORDS.**
==22==        Our hearts receive your warnings.

**KING.**
==23==Farewell.—Come hither to me.

*The King retires apart with some Lords.*

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==24==O my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

**PAR.**
==25==’Tis not his fault, the spark.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==25==              O, ’tis brave wars!

**PAR.**
==26==Most admirable! I have seen those wars.

**BER.**
==27==I am commanded here, and kept a coil with,
==28==“Too young” and “the next year” and “’tis too early.”

**PAR.**
==29==And thy mind stand to’t, boy, steal away bravely.

**BER.**
==30==I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
==31==Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
==32==Till honor be bought up, and no sword worn
==33==But one to dance with! By heaven, I’ll steal away.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==34==There’s honor in the theft.

**PAR.**
==34==              Commit it, Count.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==35==I am your accessary, and so farewell.

**BER.**
==36==I grow to you, and our parting is a tortur’d body.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==37==Farewell, captain.

**2. LORD. DUM.**
==38==Sweet *Monsieur* Parolles!

**PAR.**
==39==Noble heroes! My sword and yours are kin. Good sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword entrench’d it. Say to him I live, and observe his reports for me.

**1. LORD. DUM.**
==40==We shall, noble captain.

**PAR.**
==41==Mars dote on you for his novices!
*(Exeunt Lords.)*
==42==What will ye do?

**BER.**
==43==Stay the King.

**PAR.**
==44==Use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords; you have restrain’d yourself within the list of too cold an *adieu*. Be more expressive to them, for they wear themselves in the cap of the time, there do muster true gait; eat, speak, and move under the influence of the most receiv’d star, and though the devil lead the measure, such are to be follow’d. After them, and take a more dilated farewell.

**BER.**
==45==And I will do so.

**PAR.**
==46==Worthy fellows, and like to prove most sinewy swordmen.

*Exeunt Bertram and Parolles.*

*Enter Lafew.*

*The King comes forward.*

**LAF.**
*(Kneeling.)*
==47==Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.

**KING.**
==48==I’ll see thee to stand up.

**LAF.**
==49==Then here’s a man stands that has brought his pardon.
==50==I would you had kneel’d, my lord, to ask me mercy,
==51==And that at my bidding you could so stand up.

**KING.**
==52==I would I had, so I had broke thy pate,
==53==And ask’d thee mercy for’t.

**LAF.**
==53==              Good faith, across!
==54==But, my good lord, ’tis thus: will you be cur’d
==55==Of your infirmity?

**KING.**
==55==           No.

**LAF.**
==55==              O, will you eat
==56==No grapes, my royal fox? Yes, but you will
==57==My noble grapes, and if my royal fox
==58==Could reach them. I have seen a medicine
==59==That’s able to breathe life into a stone,
==60==Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
==61==With spritely fire and motion, whose simple touch
==62==Is powerful to araise King Pippen, nay,
==63==To give great Charlemain a pen in ’s hand
==64==And write to her a love-line.

**KING.**
==64==                What her is this?

**LAF.**
==65==Why, Doctor She! My lord, there’s one arriv’d,
==66==If you will see her. Now by my faith and honor,
==67==If seriously I may convey my thoughts
==68==In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
==69==With one, that in her sex, her years, profession,
==70==Wisdom, and constancy, hath amaz’d me more
==71==Than I dare blame my weakness. Will you see her⁠—
==72==For that is her demand—and know her business?
==73==That done, laugh well at me.

**KING.**
==73==                Now, good Lafew,
==74==Bring in the admiration, that we with thee
==75==May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
==76==By wond’ring how thou took’st it.

**LAF.**
==76==                  Nay, I’ll fit you,
==77==And not be all day neither.

*Goes to the door.*

**KING.**
==78==Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

**LAF.**
==79==Nay, come your ways.

*Enter Helen.*

**KING.**
==79==           This haste hath wings indeed.

**LAF.**
==80==Nay, come your ways;
==81==This is his Majesty, say your mind to him.
==82==A traitor you do look like, but such traitors
==83==His Majesty seldom fears. I am Cressid’s uncle,
==84==That dare leave two together; fare you well.

*Exit.*

**KING.**
==85==Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

**HEL.**
==86==Ay, my good lord.
==87==Gerard de Narbon was my father,
==88==In what he did profess, well found.

**KING.**
==88==                  I knew him.

**HEL.**
==89==The rather will I spare my praises towards him,
==90==Knowing him is enough. On ’s bed of death
==91==Many receipts he gave me; chiefly one,
==92==Which as the dearest issue of his practice,
==93==And of his old experience th’ only darling,
==94==He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
==95==Safer than mine own two, more dear. I have so,
==96==And hearing your high Majesty is touch’d
==97==With that malignant cause wherein the honor
==98==Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,
==99==I come to tender it, and my appliance,
==100==With all bound humbleness.

**KING.**
==100==                We thank you, maiden,
==101==But may not be so credulous of cure,
==102==When our most learned doctors leave us, and
==103==The congregated college have concluded
==104==That laboring art can never ransom nature
==105==From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
==106==So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
==107==To prostitute our past-cure malady
==108==To empirics, or to dissever so
==109==Our great self and our credit, to esteem
==110==A senseless help when help past sense we deem.

**HEL.**
==111==My duty then shall pay me for my pains.
==112==I will no more enforce mine office on you,
==113==Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
==114==A modest one, to bear me back again.

**KING.**
==115==I cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful.
==116==Thou thought’st to help me, and such thanks I give
==117==As one near death to those that wish him live.
==118==But what at full I know, thou know’st no part,
==119==I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

**HEL.**
==120==What I can do can do no hurt to try,
==121==Since you set up your rest ’gainst remedy.
==122==He that of greatest works is finisher
==123==Oft does them by the weakest minister:
==124==So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
==125==When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
==126==From simple sources; and great seas have dried
==127==When miracles have by the great’st been denied.
==128==Oft expectation fails, and most oft there
==129==Where most it promises; and oft it hits
==130==Where hope is coldest, and despair most fits.

**KING.**
==131==I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid,
==132==Thy pains not us’d must by thyself be paid.
==133==Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

**HEL.**
==134==Inspired merit so by breath is barr’d.
==135==It is not so with Him that all things knows
==136==As ’tis with us that square our guess by shows;
==137==But most it is presumption in us when
==138==The help of heaven we count the act of men.
==139==Dear sir, to my endeavors give consent,
==140==Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
==141==I am not an imposture that proclaim
==142==Myself against the level of mine aim,
==143==But know I think, and think I know most sure,
==144==My art is not past power, nor you past cure.

**KING.**
==145==Art thou so confident? Within what space
==146==Hop’st thou my cure?

**HEL.**
==146==           The greatest grace lending grace,
==147==Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
==148==Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
==149==Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
==150==Moist Hesperus hath quench’d her sleepy lamp,
==151==Or four and twenty times the pilot’s glass
==152==Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
==153==What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
==154==Health shall live free, and sickness freely die.

**KING.**
==155==Upon thy certainty and confidence
==156==What dar’st thou venter?

**HEL.**
==156==              Tax of impudence,
==157==A strumpet’s boldness, a divulged shame,
==158==Traduc’d by odious ballads; my maiden’s name
==159==Sear’d otherwise; ne worse of worst—extended
==160==With vildest torture, let my life be ended.

**KING.**
==161==Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
==162==His powerful sound within an organ weak;
==163==And what impossibility would slay
==164==In common sense, sense saves another way.
==165==Thy life is dear, for all that life can rate
==166==Worth name of life in thee hath estimate:
==167==Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
==168==That happiness and prime can happy call.
==169==Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
==170==Skill infinite, or monstrous desperate.
==171==Sweet practicer, thy physic I will try,
==172==That ministers thine own death if I die.

**HEL.**
==173==If I break time, or flinch in property
==174==Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
==175==And well deserv’d. Not helping, death’s my fee,
==176==But if I help, what do you promise me?

**KING.**
==177==Make thy demand.

**HEL.**
==177==           But will you make it even?

**KING.**
==178==Ay, by my scepter and my hopes of heaven.

**HEL.**
==179==Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
==180==What husband in thy power I will command.
==181==Exempted be from me the arrogance
==182==To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
==183==My low and humble name to propagate
==184==With any branch or image of thy state;
==185==But such a one thy vassal, whom I know
==186==Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

**KING.**
==187==Here is my hand, the premises observ’d,
==188==Thy will by my performance shall be serv’d.
==189==So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
==190==Thy resolv’d patient, on thee still rely.
==191==More should I question thee, and more I must⁠—
==192==Though more to know could not be more to trust⁠—
==193==From whence thou cam’st, how tended on, but rest
==194==Unquestion’d welcome and undoubted blest.⁠—
==195==Give me some help here ho!—If thou proceed
==196==As high as word, my deed shall match thy deed.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
