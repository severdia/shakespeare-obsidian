## Epilogue
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]]

**KING.**
*(Advancing.)*
The king’s a beggar, now the play is done;
All is well ended, if this suit be won,
That you express content; which we will pay,
With strife to please you, day exceeding day.
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.


*Exeunt omnes.*

[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]]
