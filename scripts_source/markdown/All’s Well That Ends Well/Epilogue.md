## Epilogue
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]]

**KING.**
*(Advancing.)*
==1==The king’s a beggar, now the play is done;
==2==All is well ended, if this suit be won,
==3==That you express content; which we will pay,
==4==With strife to please you, day exceeding day.
==5==Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
==6==Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.


*Exeunt omnes.*
