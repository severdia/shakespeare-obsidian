## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Another part of the field of battle between the British and Roman camps.*

*Enter Posthumus and a British Lord.*

**BRIT. LORD.**
==1==Cam’st thou from where they made the stand?

**POST.**
==1==                         I did,
==2==Though you it seems come from the fliers?

**BRIT. LORD.**
==2==                         I did.

**POST.**
==3==No blame be to you, sir, for all was lost
==4==But that the heavens fought; the King himself
==5==Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
==6==And but the backs of Britains seen, all flying
==7==Through a strait lane; the enemy full-hearted,
==8==Lolling the tongue with slaught’ring—having work
==9==More plentiful than tools to do’t—struck down
==10==Some mortally, some slightly touch’d, some falling
==11==Merely through fear, that the strait pass was damm’d
==12==With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
==13==To die with length’ned shame.

**BRIT. LORD.**
==13==                Where was this lane?

**POST.**
==14==Close by the battle, ditch’d, and wall’d with turf,
==15==Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier
==16==(An honest one, I warrant), who deserv’d
==17==So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
==18==In doing this for ’s country. Athwart the lane,
==19==He, with two striplings (lads more like to run
==20==The country base than to commit such slaughter,
==21==With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
==22==Than those for preservation cas’d, or shame),
==23==Made good the passage, cried to those that fled,
==24==“Our Britain’s harts die flying, not our men.
==25==To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand,
==26==Or we are Romans and will give you that
==27==Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save
==28==But to look back in frown. Stand, stand!” These three,
==29==Three thousand confident, in act as many⁠—
==30==For three performers are the file when all
==31==The rest do nothing—with this word “Stand, stand!”
==32==Accommodated by the place, more charming
==33==With their own nobleness, which could have turn’d
==34==A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks;
==35==Part shame, part spirit renew’d, that some, turn’d coward
==36==But by example (O, a sin in war,
==37==Damn’d in the first beginners!), gan to look
==38==The way that they did, and to grin like lions
==39==Upon the pikes o’ th’ hunters. Then began
==40==A stop i’ th’ chaser; a retire; anon
==41==A rout, confusion thick. Forthwith they fly
==42==Chickens, the way which they stoop’d eagles; slaves,
==43==The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,
==44==Like fragments in hard voyages, became
==45==The life o’ th’ need. Having found the back door open
==46==Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound
==47==Some slain before, some dying, some their friends
==48==O’erborne i’ th’ former wave. Ten chas’d by one
==49==Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty.
==50==Those that would die or ere resist are grown
==51==The mortal bugs o’ th’ field.

**BRIT. LORD.**
==51==              This was strange chance.
==52==A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys!

**POST.**
==53==Nay, do not wonder at it; you are made
==54==Rather to wonder at the things you hear
==55==Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon’t,
==56==And vent it for a mock’ry? Here is one:
==57==“Two boys, an old man (twice a boy), a lane,
==58==Preserv’d the Britains, was the Romans’ bane.”

**BRIT. LORD.**
==59==Nay, be not angry, sir.

**POST.**
==59==              ’Lack, to what end?
==60==Who dares not stand his foe, I’ll be his friend;
==61==For if he’ll do as he is made to do,
==62==I know he’ll quickly fly my friendship too.
==63==You have put me into rhyme.

**BRIT. LORD.**
==63==                Farewell, you’re angry.

*Exit.*

**POST.**
==64==Still going? This is a lord! O noble misery,
==65==To be i’ th’ field, and ask “what news?” of me!
==66==Today how many would have given their honors
==67==To have sav’d their carcasses! Took heel to do’t,
==68==And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm’d,
==69==Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
==70==Nor feel him where he struck. Being an ugly monster,
==71==’Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
==72==Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
==73==That draw his knives i’ th’ war. Well, I will find him;
==74==For being now a favorer to the Britain,
==75==No more a Britain, I have resum’d again
==76==The part I came in. Fight I will no more,
==77==But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
==78==Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
==79==Here made by th’ Roman; great the answer be
==80==Britains must take. For me, my ransom’s death.
==81==On either side I come to spend my breath;
==82==Which neither here I’ll keep nor bear again,
==83==But end it by some means for Imogen.

*Enter two British Captains and Soldiers.*

**1. BRIT. CAP.**
==84==Great Jupiter be prais’d! Lucius is taken.
==85==’Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.

**2. BRIT. CAP.**
==86==There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
==87==That gave th’ affront with them.

**1. BRIT. CAP.**
==87==                  So ’tis reported;
==88==But none of ’em can be found. Stand! Who’s there?

**POST.**
==89==A Roman,
==90==Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
==91==Had answer’d him.

**2. BRIT. CAP.**
==91==           Lay hands on him; a dog!
==92==A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
==93==What crows have peck’d them here. He brags his service
==94==As if he were of note. Bring him to th’ King.

*Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio, and Roman captives.*

* The Captains present Posthumus to Cymbeline, who delivers him over to a Jailer.*

*Then exeunt omnes.*
