## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Britain. A room in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Imogen and Pisanio.*

**IMO.**
==1==I would thou grew’st unto the shores o’ th’ haven,
==2==And questionedst every sail. If he should write
==3==And I not have it, ’twere a paper lost
==4==As offer’d mercy is. What was the last
==5==That he spake to thee?

**PIS.**
==5==           It was his queen, his queen!

**IMO.**
==6==Then wav’d his handkerchief?

**PIS.**
==6==                And kiss’d it, madam.

**IMO.**
==7==Senseless linen, happier therein than I!
==8==And that was all?

**PIS.**
==8==           No, madam; for so long
==9==As he could make me with this eye or ear
==10==Distinguish him from others, he did keep
==11==The deck, with glove or hat or handkerchief
==12==Still waving, as the fits and stirs of ’s mind
==13==Could best express how slow his soul sail’d on,
==14==How swift his ship.

**IMO.**
==14==           Thou shouldst have made him
==15==As little as a crow, or less, ere left
==16==To after-eye him.

**PIS.**
==16==           Madam, so I did.

**IMO.**
==17==I would have broke mine eye-strings, crack’d them, but
==18==To look upon him, till the diminution
==19==Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;
==20==Nay, followed him till he had melted from
==21==The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
==22==Have turn’d mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
==23==When shall we hear from him?

**PIS.**
==23==                Be assur’d, madam,
==24==With his next vantage.

**IMO.**
==25==I did not take my leave of him, but had
==26==Most pretty things to say. Ere I could tell him
==27==How I would think on him at certain hours
==28==Such thoughts and such; or I could make him swear
==29==The shes of Italy should not betray
==30==Mine interest and his honor; or have charg’d him,
==31==At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
==32==T’ encounter me with orisons, for then
==33==I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
==34==Give him that parting kiss which I had set
==35==Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father,
==36==And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
==37==Shakes all our buds from growing.

*Enter Helen.*

**HEL.**
==37==                  The Queen, madam,
==38==Desires your Highness’ company.

**IMO.**
==39==Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch’d,
==40==I will attend the Queen.

**PIS.**
==40==              Madam, I shall.

*Exeunt.*
