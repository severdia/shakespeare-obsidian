## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*The country near Milford-Haven.*

*Enter Pisanio and Imogen.*

**IMO.**
==1==Thou toldst me, when we came from horse, the place
==2==Was near at hand. Ne’er long’d my mother so
==3==To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! Man!
==4==Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind
==5==That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
==6==From th’ inward of thee? One but painted thus
==7==Would be interpreted a thing perplex’d
==8==Beyond self-explication. Put thyself
==9==Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
==10==Vanquish my staider senses. What’s the matter?
==11==Why tender’st thou that paper to me with
==12==A look untender? If’t be summer news,
==13==Smile to’t before; if winterly, thou need’st
==14==But keep that count’nance still. My husband’s hand!
==15==That drug-damn’d Italy hath outcraftied him,
==16==And he’s at some hard point. Speak, man, thy tongue
==17==May take off some extremity, which to read
==18==Would be even mortal to me.

**PIS.**
==18==                Please you read,
==19==And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
==20==The most disdain’d of fortune.

**IMO.**
*(Reads.)*
==21==*“Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath play’d the strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lies bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises, but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio, must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away her life. I shall give thee opportunity at Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose; where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done, thou art the pander to her dishonor and equally to me disloyal.”*

**PIS.**
==22==What shall I need to draw my sword, the paper
==23==Hath cut her throat already! No, ’tis slander,
==24==Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
==25==Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
==26==Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
==27==All corners of the world. Kings, queens, and states,
==28==Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
==29==This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?

**IMO.**
==30==False to his bed? What is it to be false?
==31==To lie in watch there, and to think on him?
==32==To weep ’twixt clock and clock? If sleep charge nature,
==33==To break it with a fearful dream of him,
==34==And cry myself awake? That’s false to ’s bed? Is it?

**PIS.**
==35==Alas, good lady!

**IMO.**
==36==I false? Thy conscience witness! Jachimo,
==37==Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
==38==Thou then look’dst like a villain; now methinks
==39==Thy favor’s good enough. Some jay of Italy
==40==(Whose mother was her painting) hath betray’d him.
==41==Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion,
==42==And for I am richer than to hang by th’ walls,
==43==I must be ripp’d. To pieces with me! O!
==44==Men’s vows are women’s traitors. All good seeming,
==45==By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
==46==Put on for villainy; not born where’t grows,
==47==But worn a bait for ladies.

**PIS.**
==47==              Good madam, hear me.

**IMO.**
==48==True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
==49==Were in his time thought false; and Sinon’s weeping
==50==Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
==51==From most true wretchedness. So thou, Posthumus,
==52==Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
==53==Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur’d
==54==From thy great fail.—Come, fellow, be thou honest,
==55==Do thou thy master’s bidding. When thou seest him,
==56==A little witness my obedience. Look
==57==I draw the sword myself, take it, and hit
==58==The innocent mansion of my love, my heart.
==59==Fear not, ’tis empty of all things but grief.
==60==Thy master is not there, who was indeed
==61==The riches of it. Do his bidding, strike.
==62==Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause,
==63==But now thou seem’st a coward.

**PIS.**
==63==                Hence, vile instrument!
==64==Thou shalt not damn my hand.

**IMO.**
==64==                Why, I must die;
==65==And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
==66==No servant of thy master’s. Against self-slaughter
==67==There is a prohibition so divine
==68==That cravens my weak hand. Come, here’s my heart:
==69==Something’s afore’t. Soft, soft, we’ll no defense,
==70==Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
==71==The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
==72==All turn’d to heresy? Away, away,
==73==Corrupters of my faith! You shall no more
==74==Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
==75==Believe false teachers. Though those that are betray’d
==76==Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
==77==Stands in worse case of woe. And thou, Posthumus,
==78==That didst set up my disobedience ’gainst the King
==79==My father, and make me put into contempt the suits
==80==Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
==81==It is no act of common passage, but
==82==A strain of rareness; and I grieve myself
==83==To think, when thou shalt be disedg’d by her
==84==That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
==85==Will then be pang’d by me. Prithee dispatch,
==86==The lamb entreats the butcher. Where’s thy knife?
==87==Thou art too slow to do thy master’s bidding
==88==When I desire it too.

**PIS.**
==88==           O gracious lady!
==89==Since I receiv’d command to do this business
==90==I have not slept one wink.

**IMO.**
==90==              Do’t, and to bed then.

**PIS.**
==91==I’ll wake mine eyeballs out first.

**IMO.**
==91==                  Wherefore then
==92==Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abus’d
==93==So many miles with a pretense? This place?
==94==Mine action? And thine own? Our horses’ labor?
==95==The time inviting thee? The perturb’d court
==96==For my being absent? Whereunto I never
==97==Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
==98==To be unbent when thou hast ta’en thy stand,
==99==Th’ elected deer before thee?

**PIS.**
==99==                But to win time
==100==To lose so bad employment, in the which
==101==I have consider’d of a course. Good lady,
==102==Hear me with patience.

**IMO.**
==102==           Talk thy tongue weary, speak.
==103==I have heard I am a strumpet, and mine ear,
==104==Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
==105==Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.

**PIS.**
==105==                  Then, madam,
==106==I thought you would not back again.

**IMO.**
==106==                  Most like,
==107==Bringing me here to kill me.

**PIS.**
==107==                Not so, neither;
==108==But if I were as wise as honest, then
==109==My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
==110==But that my master is abus’d. Some villain,
==111==Ay, and singular in his art, hath done you both
==112==This cursed injury.

**IMO.**
==113==Some Roman courtezan?

**PIS.**
==113==              No, on my life.
==114==I’ll give but notice you are dead, and send him
==115==Some bloody sign of it; for ’tis commanded
==116==I should do so. You shall be miss’d at court,
==117==And that will well confirm it.

**IMO.**
==117==              Why, good fellow,
==118==What shall I do the while? Where bide? How live?
==119==Or in my life what comfort, when I am
==120==Dead to my husband?

**PIS.**
==120==           If you’ll back to th’ court⁠—

**IMO.**
==121==No court, no father, nor no more ado
==122==With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
==123==That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
==124==As fearful as a siege.

**PIS.**
==124==           If not at court,
==125==Then not in Britain must you bide.

**IMO.**
==125==                  Where then?
==126==Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day? Night?
==127==Are they not but in Britain? I’ th’ world’s volume
==128==Our Britain seems as of it, but not in’t;
==129==In a great pool a swan’s nest. Prithee think
==130==There’s livers out of Britain.

**PIS.**
==130==                I am most glad
==131==You think of other place. Th’ ambassador,
==132==Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
==133==Tomorrow. Now, if you could wear a mind
==134==Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
==135==That which, t’ appear itself, must not yet be
==136==But by self-danger, you should tread a course
==137==Pretty and full of view; yea, happily, near
==138==The residence of Posthumus; so nigh, at least,
==139==That though his actions were not visible, yet
==140==Report should render him hourly to your ear
==141==As truly as he moves.

**IMO.**
==141==           O, for such means,
==142==Though peril to my modesty, not death on’t,
==143==I would adventure.

**PIS.**
==143==           Well then, here’s the point:
==144==You must forget to be a woman; change
==145==Command into obedience; fear and niceness
==146==(The handmaids of all women, or more truly
==147==Woman it pretty self) into a waggish courage,
==148==Ready in gibes, quick-answer’d, saucy, and
==149==As quarrellous as the weasel; nay, you must
==150==Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
==151==Exposing it (but O, the harder heart!
==152==Alack, no remedy!) to the greedy touch
==153==Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
==154==Your laborsome and dainty trims, wherein
==155==You made great Juno angry.

**IMO.**
==155==                Nay, be brief:
==156==I see into thy end, and am almost
==157==A man already.

**PIS.**
==157==        First, make yourself but like one.
==158==Forethinking this, I have already fit
==159==(’Tis in my cloak-bag) doublet, hat, hose, all
==160==That answer to them. Would you in their serving
==161==(And with what imitation you can borrow
==162==From youth of such a season) ’fore noble Lucius
==163==Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
==164==Wherein you’re happy, which will make him know,
==165==If that his head have ear in music, doubtless
==166==With joy he will embrace you; for he’s honorable,
==167==And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad⁠—
==168==You have me, rich, and I will never fail
==169==Beginning nor supplyment.

**IMO.**
==169==              Thou art all the comfort
==170==The gods will diet me with. Prithee away,
==171==There’s more to be consider’d; but we’ll even
==172==All that good time will give us. This attempt
==173==I am soldier to, and will abide it with
==174==A prince’s courage. Away, I prithee.

**PIS.**
==175==Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
==176==Lest being miss’d, I be suspected of
==177==Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
==178==Here is a box, I had it from the Queen,
==179==What’s in’t is precious. If you are sick at sea,
==180==Or stomach-qualm’d at land, a dram of this
==181==Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
==182==And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
==183==Direct you to the best!

**IMO.**
==183==           Amen! I thank thee.

*Exeunt severally.*
