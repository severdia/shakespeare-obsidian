## Act 1, Scene 6
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Britain. Another room in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Imogen alone.*

**IMO.**
==1==A father cruel, and a step-dame false,
==2==A foolish suitor to a wedded lady
==3==That hath her husband banish’d. O, that husband!
==4==My supreme crown of grief, and those repeated
==5==Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol’n,
==6==As my two brothers, happy! But most miserable
==7==Is the desire that’s glorious. Blessed be those,
==8==How mean soe’er, that have their honest wills,
==9==Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!

*Enter Pisanio and Jachimo.*

**PIS.**
==10==Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
==11==Comes from my lord with letters.

**JACH.**
==11==                  Change you, madam:
==12==The worthy Leonatus is in safety
==13==And greets your Highness dearly.

*Presents a letter.*

**IMO.**
==13==                  Thanks, good sir,
==14==You’re kindly welcome.

**JACH.**
*(Aside.)*
==15==All of her that is out of door most rich!
==16==If she be furnish’d with a mind so rare,
==17==She is alone th’ Arabian bird, and I
==18==Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend;
==19==Arm me audacity from head to foot,
==20==Or like the Parthian I shall flying fight⁠—
==21==Rather, directly fly.

**IMO.**
*(Reads.)*
==22==*“He is one of the noblest note, to whose kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon him accordingly, as you value your trust—*
==23==*Leonatus.”*
==24==So far I read aloud⁠—
==25==But even the very middle of my heart
==26==Is warm’d by th’ rest—and take it thankfully.
==27==You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
==28==Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
==29==In all that I can do.

**JACH.**
==29==           Thanks, fairest lady.
==30==What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
==31==To see this vaulted arch and the rich crop
==32==Of sea and land, which can distinguish ’twixt
==33==The fiery orbs above, and the twinn’d stones
==34==Upon the number’d beach, and can we not
==35==Partition make with spectacles so precious
==36==’Twixt fair and foul?

**IMO.**
==36==           What makes your admiration?

**JACH.**
==37==It cannot be i’ th’ eye: for apes and monkeys
==38==’Twixt two such shes would chatter this way, and
==39==Contemn with mows the other; nor i’ th’ judgment:
==40==For idiots in this case of favor would
==41==Be wisely definite; nor i’ th’ appetite:
==42==Sluttery, to such neat excellence oppos’d,
==43==Should make desire vomit emptiness,
==44==Not so allur’d to feed.

**IMO.**
==45==What is the matter, trow?

**JACH.**
==45==              The cloyed will⁠—
==46==That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
==47==Both fill’d and running—ravening first the lamb,
==48==Longs after for the garbage.

**IMO.**
==48==              What, dear sir,
==49==Thus raps you? Are you well?

**JACH.**
==50==Thanks, madam, well.
*(To Pisanio.)*
==50==              Beseech you, sir,
==51==Desire my man’s abode where I did leave him:
==52==He’s strange and peevish.

**PIS.**
==52==              I was going, sir,
==53==To give him welcome.

*Exit.*

**IMO.**
==54==Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?

**JACH.**
==55==Well, madam.

**IMO.**
==56==Is he dispos’d to mirth? I hope he is.

**JACH.**
==57==Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
==58==So merry and so gamesome. He is call’d
==59==The Britain reveler.

**IMO.**
==59==           When he was here,
==60==He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
==61==Not knowing why.

**JACH.**
==61==           I never saw him sad.
==62==There is a Frenchman his companion, one
==63==An eminent monsieur that it seems much loves
==64==A Gallian girl at home. He furnaces
==65==The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Britain
==66==(Your lord, I mean) laughs from ’s free lungs; cries “O,
==67==Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
==68==By history, report, or his own proof,
==69==What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
==70==But must be, will ’s free hours languish for
==71==Assured bondage?”

**IMO.**
==71==           Will my lord say so?

**JACH.**
==72==Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter.
==73==It is a recreation to be by
==74==And hear him mock the Frenchman. But heavens know
==75==Some men are much to blame.

**IMO.**
==75==                Not he, I hope.

**JACH.**
==76==Not he; but yet heaven’s bounty towards him might
==77==Be us’d more thankfully. In himself, ’tis much;
==78==In you, which I account his, beyond all talents.
==79==Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
==80==To pity too.

**IMO.**
==80==        What do you pity, sir?

**JACH.**
==81==Two creatures heartily.

**IMO.**
==81==              Am I one, sir?
==82==You look on me; what wrack discern you in me
==83==Deserves your pity?

**JACH.**
==83==           Lamentable! What,
==84==To hide me from the radiant sun, and solace
==85==I’ th’ dungeon by a snuff!

**IMO.**
==85==              I pray you, sir,
==86==Deliver with more openness your answers
==87==To my demands. Why do you pity me?

**JACH.**
==88==That others do
==89==(I was about to say) enjoy your—But
==90==It is an office of the gods to venge it,
==91==Not mine to speak on’t.

**IMO.**
==91==              You do seem to know
==92==Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you⁠—
==93==Since doubting things go ill often hurts more
==94==Than to be sure they do; for certainties
==95==Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
==96==The remedy then born—discover to me
==97==What both you spur and stop.

**JACH.**
==97==                Had I this cheek
==98==To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch
==99==(Whose every touch) would force the feeler’s soul
==100==To th’ oath of loyalty; this object, which
==101==Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
==102==Firing it only here; should I (damn’d then) 
==103==Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
==104==That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
==105==Made hard with hourly falsehood (falsehood, as
==106==With labor); then by-peeping in an eye
==107==Base and illustrious as the smoky light
==108==That’s fed with stinking tallow: it were fit
==109==That all the plagues of hell should at one time
==110==Encounter such revolt.

**IMO.**
==110==              My lord, I fear,
==111==Has forgot Britain.

**JACH.**
==111==           And himself. Not I
==112==Inclin’d to this intelligence pronounce
==113==The beggary of his change; but ’tis your graces
==114==That from my mutest conscience to my tongue
==115==Charms this report out.

**IMO.**
==115==              Let me hear no more.

**JACH.**
==116==O dearest soul! Your cause doth strike my heart
==117==With pity that doth make me sick. A lady
==118==So fair, and fasten’d to an empery
==119==Would make the great’st king double—to be partner’d
==120==With tomboys hir’d with that self exhibition
==121==Which your own coffers yield; with diseas’d ventures
==122==That play with all infirmities for gold
==123==Which rottenness can lend nature; such boil’d stuff
==124==As well might poison poison. Be reveng’d,
==125==Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
==126==Recoil from your great stock.

**IMO.**
==126==                Reveng’d?
==127==How should I be reveng’d? If this be true
==128==(As I have such a heart that both mine ears
==129==Must not in haste abuse), if it be true,
==130==How should I be reveng’d?

**JACH.**
==130==              Should he make me
==131==Live, like Diana’s priest, betwixt cold sheets,
==132==Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
==133==In your despite, upon your purse—revenge it.
==134==I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
==135==More noble than that runagate to your bed,
==136==And will continue fast to your affection,
==137==Still close as sure.

**IMO.**
==137==           What ho, Pisanio!

**JACH.**
==138==Let me my service tender on your lips.

**IMO.**
==139==Away, I do condemn mine ears that have
==140==So long attended thee. If thou wert honorable,
==141==Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
==142==For such an end thou seek’st—as base as strange.
==143==Thou wrong’st a gentleman, who is as far
==144==From thy report as thou from honor, and
==145==Solicits here a lady that disdains
==146==Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
==147==The King my father shall be made acquainted
==148==Of thy assault. If he shall think it fit
==149==A saucy stranger in his court to mart
==150==As in a Romish stew, and to expound
==151==His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
==152==He little cares for and a daughter who
==153==He not respects at all. What ho, Pisanio!

**JACH.**
==154==O happy Leonatus! I may say,
==155==The credit that thy lady hath of thee
==156==Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
==157==Her assur’d credit. Blessed live you long,
==158==A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
==159==Country call’d his; and you his mistress, only
==160==For the most worthiest fit. Give me your pardon.
==161==I have spoke this to know if your affiance
==162==Were deeply rooted, and shall make your lord,
==163==That which he is, new o’er; and he is one
==164==The truest manner’d, such a holy witch
==165==That he enchants societies into him;
==166==Half all men’s hearts are his.

**IMO.**
==166==                You make amends.

**JACH.**
==167==He sits ’mongst men like a descended god;
==168==He hath a kind of honor sets him off,
==169==More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
==170==Most mighty Princess, that I have adventur’d
==171==To try your taking of a false report, which hath
==172==Honor’d with confirmation your great judgment
==173==In the election of a sir so rare,
==174==Which you know cannot err. The love I bear him
==175==Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you
==176==(Unlike all others) chaffless. Pray your pardon.

**IMO.**
==177==All’s well, sir. Take my pow’r i’ th’ court for yours.

**JACH.**
==178==My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
==179==T’ entreat your Grace but in a small request,
==180==And yet of moment too, for it concerns:
==181==Your lord, myself, and other noble friends
==182==Are partners in the business.

**IMO.**
==182==                Pray, what is’t?

**JACH.**
==183==Some dozen Romans of us and your lord
==184==(The best feather of our wing) have mingled sums
==185==To buy a present for the Emperor;
==186==Which I (the factor for the rest) have done
==187==In France. ’Tis plate of rare device, and jewels
==188==Of rich and exquisite form, their values great,
==189==And I am something curious, being strange,
==190==To have them in safe stowage. May it please you
==191==To take them in protection?

**IMO.**
==191==                Willingly;
==192==And pawn mine honor for their safety. Since
==193==My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
==194==In my bedchamber.

**JACH.**
==194==           They are in a trunk,
==195==Attended by my men. I will make bold
==196==To send them to you, only for this night;
==197==I must aboard tomorrow.

**IMO.**
==197==              O no, no.

**JACH.**
==198==Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
==199==By length’ning my return. From Gallia
==200==I cross’d the seas on purpose and on promise
==201==To see your Grace.

**IMO.**
==201==           I thank you for your pains:
==202==But not away tomorrow!

**JACH.**
==202==              O, I must, madam.
==203==Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
==204==To greet your lord with writing, do’t tonight.
==205==I have outstood my time, which is material
==206==To th’ tender of our present.

**IMO.**
==206==                I will write.
==207==Send your trunk to me, it shall safe be kept,
==208==And truly yielded you. You’re very welcome.

*Exeunt.*
