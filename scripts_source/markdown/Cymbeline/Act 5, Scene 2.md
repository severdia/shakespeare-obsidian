## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.*

*Enter Lucius, Jachimo, and the Roman army at one door, and the Britain army at another; Leonatus Posthumus following, like a poor soldier.*

*They march over and go out.*

*Then enter again, in skirmish, Jachimo and Posthumus.*

*Posthumus vanquisheth and disarmeth Jachimo.*

*Posthumus then leaves him.*

**JACH.**
==1==The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
==2==Takes off my manhood. I have belied a lady,
==3==The Princess of this country; and the air on’t
==4==Revengingly enfeebles me, or could this carl,
==5==A very drudge of nature’s, have subdu’d me
==6==In my profession? Knighthoods and honors, borne
==7==As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
==8==If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
==9==This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
==10==Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.

*Exit.*

*The battle continues, the Britains fly, Cymbeline is taken.*

*Then enter, to his rescue, Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.*

**BEL.**
==11==Stand, stand! We have th’ advantage of the ground,
==12==The lane is guarded. Nothing routs us but
==13==The villainy of our fears.

**BOTH ARV. AND GUI.**
==13==              Stand, stand, and fight!

*Enter Posthumus and seconds the Britains.*

*They rescue Cymbeline and exeunt.*

*Then enter Lucius, Jachimo, and Imogen.*

**LUC.**
==14==Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
==15==For friends kill friends, and the disorder’s such
==16==As war were hoodwink’d.

**JACH.**
==16==              ’Tis their fresh supplies.

**LUC.**
==17==It is a day turn’d strangely. Or betimes
==18==Let’s reinforce, or fly.

*Exeunt.*
