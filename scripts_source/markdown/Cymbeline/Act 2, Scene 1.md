## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 6|← Act 1, Scene 6]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Britain. Before Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Cloten and the two Lords.*

**CLO.**
==1==Was there ever man had such luck? When I kiss’d the jack upon an up-cast, to be hit away! I had a hundred pound on’t; and then a whoreson jack-an-apes must take me up for swearing, as if I borrow’d mine oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.

**1. LORD.**
==2==What got he by that? You have broke his pate with your bowl.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==3==If his wit had been like him that broke it, it would have run all out.

**CLO.**
==4==When a gentleman is dispos’d to swear, it is not for any standers-by to curtal his oaths. Ha?

**2. LORD.**
==5==No, my lord;
*(Aside.)*
==5==        nor crop the ears of them.

**CLO.**
==6==Whoreson dog! I gave him satisfaction! Would he had been one of my rank!

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==7==To have smell’d like a fool.

**CLO.**
==8==I am not vex’d more at any thing in th’ earth; a pox on’t! I had rather not be so noble as I am. They dare not fight with me because of the Queen my mother. Every Jack slave hath his bellyful of fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that nobody can match.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==9==You are cock and capon too, and you crow, cock, with your comb on.

**CLO.**
==10==Sayest thou?

**2. LORD.**
==11==It is not fit your lordship should undertake every companion that you give offense to.

**CLO.**
==12==No, I know that; but it is fit I should commit offense to my inferiors.

**2. LORD.**
==13==Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

**CLO.**
==14==Why, so I say.

**1. LORD.**
==15==Did you hear of a stranger that’s come to court tonight?

**CLO.**
==16==A stranger, and I not know on’t?

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==17==He’s a strange fellow himself, and knows it not.

**1. LORD.**
==18==There’s an Italian come, and ’tis thought one of Leonatus’ friends.

**CLO.**
==19==Leonatus? A banish’d rascal; and he’s another, whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?

**1. LORD.**
==20==One of your lordship’s pages.

**CLO.**
==21==Is it fit I went to look upon him? Is there no derogation in’t?

**2. LORD.**
==22==You cannot derogate, my lord.

**CLO.**
==23==Not easily, I think.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==24==You are a fool granted, therefore your issues, being foolish, do not derogate.

**CLO.**
==25==Come, I’ll go see this Italian. What I have lost today at bowls I’ll win tonight of him. Come; go.

**2. LORD.**
==26==I’ll attend your lordship.
*(Exeunt Cloten and First Lord.)*
==27==That such a crafty devil as is his mother
==28==Should yield the world this ass! A woman that
==29==Bears all down with her brain, and this her son
==30==Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
==31==And leave eighteen. Alas, poor Princess,
==32==Thou divine Imogen, what thou endur’st,
==33==Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern’d,
==34==A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
==35==More hateful than the foul expulsion is
==36==Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
==37==Of the divorce he’ld make. The heavens hold firm
==38==The walls of thy dear honor; keep unshak’d
==39==That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand
==40==T’ enjoy thy banish’d lord and this great land!

*Exit.*
