## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Before Belarius’ cave.*

*Enter Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, and Imogen from the cave.*

**BEL.**
*(To Imogen.)*
==1== You are not well. Remain here in the cave,
==2== We’ll come to you after hunting.

**ARV.**
*(To Imogen.)*
==2==                   Brother, stay here.
==3== Are we not brothers?

**IMO.**
==3==            So man and man should be,
==4== But clay and clay differs in dignity,
==5== Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.

**GUI.**
==6== Go you to hunting, I’ll abide with him.

**IMO.**
==7== So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
==8== But not so citizen a wanton as
==9== To seem to die ere sick. So please you, leave me,
==10== Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
==11== Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
==12== Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
==13== To one not sociable. I am not very sick,
==14== Since I can reason of it. Pray you trust me here,
==15== I’ll rob none but myself, and let me die,
==16== Stealing so poorly.

**GUI.**
==16==            I love thee; I have spoke it;
==17== How much the quantity, the weight as much,
==18== As I do love my father.

**BEL.**
==18==               What? How? How?

**ARV.**
==19== If it be sin to say so, sir, I yoke me
==20== In my good brother’s fault. I know not why
==21== I love this youth, and I have heard you say,
==22== Love’s reason’s without reason. The bier at door,
==23== And a demand who is’t shall die, I’ld say
==24== “My father, not this youth.”

**BEL.**
*(Aside.)*
==24==                 O noble strain!
==25== O worthiness of nature! Breed of greatness!
==26== Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:
==27== Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
==28== I’m not their father, yet who this should be
==29== Doth miracle itself, lov’d before me.⁠—
==30== ’Tis the ninth hour o’ th’ morn.

**ARV.**
==30==                   Brother, farewell.

**IMO.**
==31== I wish ye sport.

**ARV.**
==31==         You health.
*(To Belarius.)*
==31==                   So please you, sir.

**IMO.**
*(Aside.)*
==32== These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies I have heard!
==33== Our courtiers say all’s savage but at court.
==34== Experience, O, thou disprov’st report!
==35== Th’ imperious seas breeds monsters; for the dish,
==36== Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
==37== I am sick still, heart-sick. Pisanio,
==38== I’ll now taste of thy drug.

*Swallows some.*

**GUI.**
==38==                 I could not stir him.
==39== He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
==40== Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.

**ARV.**
==41== Thus did he answer me; yet said hereafter
==42== I might know more.

**BEL.**
==42==            To th’ field, to th’ field!
==43== We’ll leave you for this time, go in, and rest.

**ARV.**
==44== We’ll not be long away.

**BEL.**
==44==               Pray, be not sick,
==45== For you must be our huswife.

**IMO.**
==45==                 Well or ill,
==46== I am bound to you.

**BEL.**
==47== And shalt be ever.
*(Exit Imogen to the cave.)*
==48== This youth, how e’er distress’d, appears he hath had
==49== Good ancestors.

**ARV.**
==49==         How angel-like he sings!

**GUI.**
==50== But his neat cookery! He cut our roots in characters,
==51== And sauc’d our broths, as Juno had been sick
==52== And he her dieter.

**ARV.**
==52==            Nobly he yokes
==53== A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
==54== Was that it was for not being such a smile;
==55== The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
==56== From so divine a temple to commix
==57== With winds that sailors rail at.

**GUI.**
==57==                   I do note
==58== That grief and patience, rooted in them both,
==59== Mingle their spurs together.

**ARV.**
==59==                 Grow patience,
==60== And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
==61== His perishing root with the increasing vine.

**BEL.**
==62== It is great morning. Come away!—Who’s there?

*Enter Cloten.*

**CLO.**
==63== I cannot find those runagates, that villain
==64== Hath mock’d me. I am faint.

**BEL.**
==64==                 “Those runagates”?
==65== Means he not us? I partly know him, ’tis
==66== Cloten, the son o’ th’ Queen. I fear some ambush.
==67== I saw him not these many years, and yet
==68== I know ’tis he. We are held as outlaws. Hence!

**GUI.**
==69== He is but one. You and my brother search
==70== What companies are near. Pray you away,
==71== Let me alone with him.

*Exeunt Belarius and Arviragus.*

**CLO.**
==71==               Soft, what are you
==72== That fly me thus? Some villain mountainers?
==73== I have heard of such. What slave art thou?

**GUI.**
==73==                        A thing
==74== More slavish did I ne’er than answering
==75== A slave without a knock.

**CLO.**
==75==               Thou art a robber,
==76== A law-breaker, a villain. Yield thee, thief.

**GUI.**
==77== To who? To thee? What art thou? Have not I
==78== An arm as big as thine? A heart as big?
==79== Thy words I grant are bigger; for I wear not
==80== My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art;
==81== Why I should yield to thee.

**CLO.**
==81==               Thou villain base,
==82== Know’st me not by my clothes?

**GUI.**
==82==                 No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
==83== Who is thy grandfather! He made those clothes,
==84== Which (as it seems) make thee.

**CLO.**
==84==                 Thou precious varlet,
==85== My tailor made them not.

**GUI.**
==85==               Hence then, and thank
==86== The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool,
==87== I am loath to beat thee.

**CLO.**
==87==               Thou injurious thief,
==88== Hear but my name, and tremble.

**GUI.**
==88==                   What’s thy name?

**CLO.**
==89== Cloten, thou villain.

**GUI.**
==90== Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
==91== I cannot tremble at it. Were it Toad, or Adder, Spider,
==92== ’Twould move me sooner.

**CLO.**
==92==               To thy further fear,
==93== Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
==94== I am son to th’ Queen.

**GUI.**
==95== I am sorry for’t; not seeming
==96== So worthy as thy birth.

**CLO.**
==96==               Art not afeard?

**GUI.**
==97== Those that I reverence, those I fear—the wise:
==98== At fools I laugh, not fear them.

**CLO.**
==98==                   Die the death!
==99== When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
==100== I’ll follow those that even now fled hence,
==101== And on the gates of Lud’s-Town set your heads.
==102== Yield, rustic mountaineer.

*Fight and exeunt.*

*Enter Belarius and Arviragus.*

**BEL.**
==103== No company’s abroad?

**ARV.**
==104== None in the world. You did mistake him sure.

**BEL.**
==105== I cannot tell; long is it since I saw him,
==106== But time hath nothing blurr’d those lines of favor
==107== Which then he wore. The snatches in his voice,
==108== And burst of speaking, were as his. I am absolute
==109== ’Twas very Cloten.

**ARV.**
==109==            In this place we left them.
==110== I wish my brother make good time with him,
==111== You say he is so fell.

**BEL.**
==111==            Being scarce made up,
==112== I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
==113== Of roaring terrors; for defect of judgment
==114== Is oft the cause of fear.
*(Enter Guiderius with Cloten’s head.)*
==114==               But see, thy brother.

**GUI.**
==115== This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse,
==116== There was no money in’t. Not Hercules
==117== Could have knock’d out his brains, for he had none.
==118== Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
==119== My head as I do his.

**BEL.**
==119==            What hast thou done?

**GUI.**
==120== I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten’s head,
==121== Son to the Queen (after his own report),
==122== Who call’d me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
==123== With his own single hand he’ld take us in,
==124== Displace our heads where (thanks, ye gods!) they grow,
==125== And set them on Lud’s-Town.

**BEL.**
==125==                 We are all undone.

**GUI.**
==126== Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
==127== But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
==128== Protects not us; then why should we be tender
==129== To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
==130== Play judge and executioner all himself,
==131== For we do fear the law? What company
==132== Discover you abroad?

**BEL.**
==132==            No single soul
==133== Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
==134== He must have some attendants. Though his humor
==135== Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
==136== From one bad thing to worse, not frenzy, not
==137== Absolute madness could so far have rav’d
==138== To bring him here alone; although perhaps
==139== It may be heard at court that such as we
==140== Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
==141== May make some stronger head, the which he hearing
==142== (As it is like him), might break out and swear
==143== He’ld fetch us in; yet is’t not probable
==144== To come alone, either he so undertaking,
==145== Or they so suffering. Then on good ground we fear,
==146== If we do fear this body hath a tail
==147== More perilous than the head.

**ARV.**
==147==                 Let ord’nance
==148== Come as the gods foresay it; howsoe’er,
==149== My brother hath done well.

**BEL.**
==149==               I had no mind
==150== To hunt this day; the boy Fidele’s sickness
==151== Did make my way long forth.

**GUI.**
==151==                 With his own sword,
==152== Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta’en
==153== His head from him. I’ll throw’t into the creek
==154== Behind our rock, and let it to the sea,
==155== And tell the fishes he’s the Queen’s son, Cloten.
==156== That’s all I reak.

*Exit.*

**BEL.**
==156==            I fear ’twill be reveng’d,
==157== Would, Polydore, thou hadst not done’t! Though valor
==158== Becomes thee well enough.

**ARV.**
==158==               Would I had done’t!
==159== So the revenge alone pursu’d me. Polydore,
==160== I love thee brotherly, but envy much
==161== Thou hast robb’d me of this deed. I would revenges,
==162== That possible strength might meet, would seek us through
==163== And put us to our answer.

**BEL.**
==163==               Well, ’tis done.
==164== We’ll hunt no more today, nor seek for danger
==165== Where there’s no profit. I prithee to our rock,
==166== You and Fidele play the cooks. I’ll stay
==167== Till hasty Polydore return, and bring him
==168== To dinner presently.

**ARV.**
==168==            Poor sick Fidele!
==169== I’ll willingly to him. To gain his color
==170== I’ld let a parish of such Clotens blood,
==171== And praise myself for charity.

*Exit.*

**BEL.**
==171==                   O thou goddess,
==172== Thou divine Nature, thou thyself thou blazon’st
==173== In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
==174== As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
==175== Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
==176== Their royal blood enchaf’d, as the rud’st wind
==177== That by the top doth take the mountain pine
==178== And make him stoop to th’ vale. ’Tis wonder
==179== That an invisible instinct should frame them
==180== To royalty unlearn’d, honor untaught,
==181== Civility not seen from other, valor
==182== That wildly grows in them but yields a crop
==183== As if it had been sow’d. Yet still it’s strange
==184== What Cloten’s being here to us portends,
==185== Or what his death will bring us.

*Enter Guiderius.*

**GUI.**
==185==                 Where’s my brother?
==186== I have sent Cloten’s clotpole down the stream
==187== In embassy to his mother. His body’s hostage
==188== For his return.

*Solemn music.*

**BEL.**
==188==            My ingenious instrument
==189== (Hark, Polydore), it sounds! But what occasion
==190== Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!

**GUI.**
==191== Is he at home?

**BEL.**
==191==         He went hence even now.

**GUI.**
==192== What does he mean? Since death of my dear’st mother
==193== It did not speak before. All solemn things
==194== Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
==195== Triumphs for nothing, and lamenting toys,
==196== Is jollity for apes, and grief for boys.
==197== Is Cadwal mad?

*Enter Arviragus with Imogen as dead, bearing her in his arms.*

**BEL.**
==197==            Look, here he comes,
==198== And brings the dire occasion in his arms
==199== Of what we blame him for.

**ARV.**
==199==                 The bird is dead
==200== That we have made so much on. I had rather
==201== Have skipp’d from sixteen years of age to sixty,
==202== To have turn’d my leaping time into a crutch,
==203== Than have seen this.

**GUI.**
==203==            O sweetest, fairest lily!
==204== My brother wears thee not the one half so well
==205== As when thou grew’st thyself.

**BEL.**
==205==                 O melancholy,
==206== Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? Find
==207== The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
==208== Mightst easil’est harbor in? Thou blessed thing,
==209== Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
==210== Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
==211== How found you him?

**ARV.**
==211==            Stark, as you see;
==212== Thus smiling, as some fly had tickled slumber,
==213== Not as death’s dart being laugh’d at; his right cheek
==214== Reposing on a cushion.

**GUI.**
==214==               Where?

**ARV.**
==214==                   O’ th’ floor.
==215== His arms thus leagu’d. I thought he slept, and put
==216== My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
==217== Answer’d my steps too loud.

**GUI.**
==217==               Why, he but sleeps!
==218== If he be gone, he’ll make his grave a bed.
==219== With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
==220== And worms will not come to thee.

**ARV.**
==220==                   With fairest flowers
==221== Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
==222== I’ll sweeten thy sad grave. Thou shalt not lack
==223== The flower that’s like thy face, pale primrose, nor
==224== The azur’d harebell, like thy veins; no, nor
==225== The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
==226== Outsweet’ned not thy breath. The raddock would,
==227== With charitable bill (O bill, sore shaming
==228== Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
==229== Without a monument!), bring thee all this,
==230== Yea, and furr’d moss besides. When flow’rs are none,
==231== To winter-ground thy corse⁠—

**GUI.**
==231==                 Prithee have done,
==232== And do not play in wench-like words with that
==233== Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
==234== And not protract with admiration what
==235== Is now due debt. To th’ grave!

**ARV.**
==235==                 Say, where shall ’s lay him?

**GUI.**
==236== By good Euriphile, our mother.

**ARV.**
==236==                   Be’t so;
==237== And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
==238== Have got the mannish crack, sing him to th’ ground,
==239== As once to our mother; use like note and words,
==240== Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.

**GUI.**
==241== Cadwal,
==242== I cannot sing. I’ll weep, and word it with thee;
==243== For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
==244== Than priests and fanes that lie.

**ARV.**
==244==                 We’ll speak it then.

**BEL.**
==245== Great griefs, I see, med’cine the less; for Cloten
==246== Is quite forgot. He was a queen’s son, boys,
==247== And though he came our enemy, remember
==248== He was paid for that. Though mean and mighty, rotting
==249== Together, have one dust, yet reverence
==250== (That angel of the world) doth make distinction
==251== Of place ’tween high and low. Our foe was princely,
==252== And though you took his life, as being our foe,
==253== Yet bury him as a prince.

**GUI.**
==253==               Pray you fetch him hither.
==254== Thersites’ body is as good as Ajax’,
==255== When neither are alive.

**ARV.**
==255==               If you’ll go fetch him,
==256== We’ll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.

*Exit Belarius.*

**GUI.**
==257== Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to th’ east,
==258== My father hath a reason for’t.

**ARV.**
==258==                 ’Tis true.

**GUI.**
==259== Come on then, and remove him.

**ARV.**
==259==                   So. Begin.

*Song.*

**GUI.**
==260== *Fear no more the heat o’ th’ sun,*
==261== *Nor the furious winter’s rages,*
==262== *Thou thy worldly task hast done,*
==263== *Home art gone, and ta’en thy wages.*
==264== *Golden lads and girls all must,*
==265== *As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.*

**ARV.**
==266== *Fear no more the frown o’ th’ great,*
==267== *Thou art past the tyrant’s stroke;*
==268== *Care no more to clothe and eat,*
==269== *To thee the reed is as the oak.*
==270== *The scepter, learning, physic, must*
==271== *All follow this and come to dust.*

**GUI.**
==272== *Fear no more the lightning-flash.*

**ARV.**
==273== *Nor th’ all-dreaded thunder-stone.*

**GUI.**
==274== *Fear not slander, censure rash.*

**ARV.**
==275== *Thou hast finish’d joy and moan.*

**BOTH ARV. AND GUI.**
==276== *All lovers young, all lovers must*
==277== *Consign to thee and come to dust.*

**GUI.**
==278== *No exercisor harm thee.*

**ARV.**
==279== *Nor no witchcraft charm thee.*

**GUI.**
==280== *Ghost unlaid forbear thee.*

**ARV.**
==281== *Nothing ill come near thee.*

**BOTH ARV. AND GUI.**
==282== *Quiet consummation have,*
==283== *And renowned be thy grave.*

*Enter Belarius with the body of Cloten.*

**GUI.**
==284== We have done our obsequies. Come lay him down.

**BEL.**
==285== Here’s a few flow’rs, but ’bout midnight, more:
==286== The herbs that have on them cold dew o’ th’ night
==287== Are strewings fitt’st for graves. Upon their faces.
==288== You were as flow’rs, now wither’d; even so
==289== These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
==290== Come on, away, apart upon our knees.
==291== The ground that gave them first has them again:
==292== Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.

*Exeunt Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.*

**IMO.**
*(Awakes.)*
==293== Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven, which is the way?
==294== I thank you. By yond bush? Pray how far thither?
==295== ’Od’s pittikins! Can it be six mile yet?
==296== I have gone all night. Faith, I’ll lie down and sleep.
*(Sees the body of Cloten.)*
==297== But soft! No bedfellow! O gods and goddesses!
==298== These flow’rs are like the pleasures of the world;
==299== This bloody man, the care on’t. I hope I dream;
==300== For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
==301== And cook to honest creatures. But ’tis not so.
==302== ’Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
==303== Which the brain makes of fumes. Our very eyes
==304== Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
==305== I tremble still with fear; but if there be
==306== Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
==307== As a wren’s eye, fear’d gods, a part of it!
==308== The dream’s here still; even when I wake, it is
==309== Without me, as within me; not imagin’d, felt.
==310== A headless man? The garments of Posthumus?
==311== I know the shape of ’s leg; this is his hand,
==312== His foot Mercurial, his Martial thigh,
==313== The brawns of Hercules; but his Jovial face⁠—
==314== Murder in heaven? How? ’Tis gone. Pisanio,
==315== All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
==316== And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
==317== Conspir’d with that irregulous devil Cloten,
==318== Hath here cut off my lord. To write and read
==319== Be henceforth treacherous! Damn’d Pisanio
==320== Hath with his forged letters (damn’d Pisanio!) 
==321== From this most bravest vessel of the world
==322== Struck the main-top! O Posthumus, alas,
==323== Where is thy head? Where’s that? Ay me! Where’s that?
==324== Pisanio might have kill’d thee at the heart
==325== And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
==326== ’Tis he and Cloten. Malice and lucre in them
==327== Have laid this woe here. O, ’tis pregnant, pregnant!
==328== The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
==329== And cordial to me, have I not found it
==330== Murd’rous to th’ senses? That confirms it home.
==331== This is Pisanio’s deed, and Cloten. O!
==332== Give color to my pale cheek with thy blood,
==333== That we the horrider may seem to those
==334== Which chance to find us. O, my lord! My lord!

*Falls on the body.*

*Enter Lucius, Captains, and Philarmonus, a soothsayer.*

**CAP.**
==335== To them the legions garrison’d in Gallia,
==336== After your will, have cross’d the sea, attending
==337== You here at Milford-Haven with your ships.
==338== They are here in readiness.

**LUC.**
==338==               But what from Rome?

**CAP.**
==339== The Senate hath stirr’d up the confiners
==340== And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits
==341== That promise noble service; and they come
==342== Under the conduct of bold Jachimo,
==343== Sienna’s brother.

**LUC.**
==343==            When expect you them?

**CAP.**
==344== With the next benefit o’ th’ wind.

**LUC.**
==344==                   This forwardness
==345== Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
==346== Be muster’d; bid the captains look to’t. Now, sir,
==347== What have you dream’d of late of this war’s purpose?

**PHIL.**
==348== Last night the very gods show’d me a vision
==349== (I fast and pray’d for their intelligence) thus:
==350== I saw Jove’s bird, the Roman eagle, wing’d
==351== From the spungy south to this part of the west,
==352== There vanish’d in the sunbeams, which portends
==353== (Unless my sins abuse my divination) 
==354== Success to th’ Roman host.

**LUC.**
==354==               Dream often so,
==355== And never false. Soft ho, what trunk is here?
==356== Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
==357== It was a worthy building. How? A page?
==358== Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;
==359== For nature doth abhor to make his bed
==360== With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead,
==361== Let’s see the boy’s face.

**CAP.**
==361==               He’s alive, my lord.

**LUC.**
==362== He’ll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
==363== Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
==364== They crave to be demanded. Who is this
==365== Thou mak’st thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
==366== That (otherwise than noble nature did) 
==367== Hath alter’d that good picture? What’s thy interest
==368== In this sad wrack? How came’t? Who is’t?
==369== What art thou?

**IMO.**
==369==         I am nothing; or if not,
==370== Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
==371== A very valiant Britain, and a good,
==372== That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas,
==373== There is no more such masters. I may wander
==374== From east to occident, cry out for service,
==375== Try many, all good; serve truly; never
==376== Find such another master.

**LUC.**
==376==                   ’Lack, good youth!
==377== Thou mov’st no less with thy complaining than
==378== Thy master in bleeding. Say his name, good friend.

**IMO.**
==379== Richard du Champ.
*(Aside.)*
==379==            If I do lie and do
==380== No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
==381== They’ll pardon it.—Say you, sir?

**LUC.**
==381==                 Thy name?

**IMO.**
==381==                        Fidele, sir.

**LUC.**
==382== Thou dost approve thyself the very same;
==383== Thy name well fits thy faith; thy faith thy name.
==384== Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
==385== Thou shalt be so well master’d, but be sure
==386== No less belov’d. The Roman Emperor’s letters,
==387== Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
==388== Than thine own worth prefer thee. Go with me.

**IMO.**
==389== I’ll follow, sir. But first, and’t please the gods,
==390== I’ll hide my master from the flies, as deep
==391== As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
==392== With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha’ strew’d his grave,
==393== And on it said a century of prayers
==394== (Such as I can) twice o’er, I’ll weep and sigh,
==395== And leaving so his service, follow you,
==396== So please you entertain me.

**LUC.**
==396==               Ay, good youth,
==397== And rather father thee than master thee.
==398== My friends,
==399== The boy hath taught us manly duties. Let us
==400== Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
==401== And make him with our pikes and partisans
==402== A grave. Come, arm him. Boy, he’s preferr’d
==403== By thee to us, and he shall be interr’d
==404== As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes:
==405== Some falls are means the happier to arise.

*Exeunt.*
