## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Britain. A hall in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter in state Cymbeline, Queen, Cloten, and Lords at one door, and at another, Caius Lucius and Attendants.*

**CYM.**
==1==Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?

**LUC.**
==2==When Julius Caesar (whose remembrance yet
==3==Lives in men’s eyes, and will to ears and tongues
==4==Be theme and hearing ever) was in this Britain,
==5==And conquer’d it, Cassibelan, thine uncle
==6==(Famous in Caesar’s praises, no whit less
==7==Than in his feats deserving it), for him
==8==And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
==9==Yearly three thousand pounds, which, by thee, lately
==10==Is left untender’d.

**QUEEN.**
==10==           And to kill the marvel,
==11==Shall be so ever.

**CLO.**
==11==        There be many Caesars,
==12==Ere such another Julius. Britain’s a world
==13==By itself, and we will nothing pay
==14==For wearing our own noses.

**QUEEN.**
==14==              That opportunity
==15==Which then they had to take from ’s, to resume
==16==We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
==17==The kings your ancestors, together with
==18==The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
==19==As Neptune’s park, ribb’d and pal’d in
==20==With oaks unscalable and roaring waters,
==21==With sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats,
==22==But suck them up to th’ topmast. A kind of conquest
==23==Caesar made here, but made not here his brag
==24==Of “Came, and saw, and overcame.” With shame
==25==(The first that ever touch’d him) he was carried
==26==From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping
==27==(Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas,
==28==Like egg-shells mov’d upon their surges, crack’d
==29==As easily ’gainst our rocks. For joy whereof
==30==The fam’d Cassibelan, who was once at point
==31==(O giglet Fortune!) to master Caesar’s sword,
==32==Made Lud’s-Town with rejoicing fires bright,
==33==And Britains strut with courage.

**CLO.**
==34==Come, there’s no more tribute to be paid. Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and (as I said) there is no more such Caesars. Other of them may have crook’d noses, but to owe such straight arms, none.

**CYM.**
==35==Son, let your mother end.

**CLO.**
==36==We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan. I do not say I am one; but I have a hand. Why tribute? Why should we pay tribute? If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

**CYM.**
==37==You must know,
==38==Till the injurious Romans did extort
==39==This tribute from us, we were free. Caesar’s ambition,
==40==Which swell’d so much that it did almost stretch
==41==The sides o’ th’ world, against all color here
==42==Did put the yoke upon ’s; which to shake off
==43==Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
==44==Ourselves to be. We do say then to Caesar,
==45==Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
==46==Ordain’d our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
==47==Hath too much mangled, whose repair and franchise
==48==Shall (by the power we hold) be our good deed,
==49==Though Rome be therefore angry. Mulmutius made our laws,
==50==Who was the first of Britain which did put
==51==His brows within a golden crown and call’d
==52==Himself a king.

**LUC.**
==52==        I am sorry, Cymbeline,
==53==That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar
==54==(Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
==55==Thyself domestic officers) thine enemy.
==56==Receive it from me then: war and confusion
==57==In Caesar’s name pronounce I ’gainst thee; look
==58==For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
==59==I thank thee for myself.

**CYM.**
==59==              Thou art welcome, Caius.
==60==Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
==61==Much under him; of him I gather’d honor,
==62==Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
==63==Behooves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
==64==That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
==65==Their liberties are now in arms, a president
==66==Which not to read would show the Britains cold.
==67==So Caesar shall not find them.

**LUC.**
==67==                Let proof speak.

**CLO.**
==68==His Majesty bids you welcome. Make pastime with us a day or two, or longer. If you seek us afterwards in other terms, you shall find us in our salt-water girdle. If you beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in the adventure, our crows shall fare the better for you; and there’s an end.

**LUC.**
==69==So, sir.

**CYM.**
==70==I know your master’s pleasure and he mine:
==71==All the remain is “Welcome!”

*Exeunt.*
