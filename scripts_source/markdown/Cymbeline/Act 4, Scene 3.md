## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Britain. A room in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Cymbeline, Lords, and Pisanio with Attendants.*

**CYM.**
==1==Again; and bring me word how ’tis with her.
*(Exit an Attendant.)*
==2==A fever with the absence of her son;
==3==A madness, of which her life’s in danger. Heavens,
==4==How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
==5==The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
==6==Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
==7==When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
==8==So needful for this present! It strikes me, past
==9==The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
==10==Who needs must know of her departure, and
==11==Dost seem so ignorant, we’ll enforce it from thee
==12==By a sharp torture.

**PIS.**
==12==           Sir, my life is yours,
==13==I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,
==14==I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
==15==Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your Highness,
==16==Hold me your loyal servant.

**1. LORD.**
==16==              Good my liege,
==17==The day that she was missing he was here;
==18==I dare be bound he’s true and shall perform
==19==All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
==20==There wants no diligence in seeking him,
==21==And will, no doubt, be found.

**CYM.**
==21==                The time is troublesome.
*(To Pisanio.)*
==22==We’ll slip you for a season, but our jealousy
==23==Does yet depend.

**1. LORD.**
==23==        So please your Majesty,
==24==The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
==25==Are landed on your coast, with a supply
==26==Of Roman gentlemen, by the Senate sent.

**CYM.**
==27==Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
==28==I am amaz’d with matter.

**1. LORD.**
==28==              Good my liege,
==29==Your preparation can affront no less
==30==Than what you hear of. Come more, for more you’re ready;
==31==The want is but to put those pow’rs in motion
==32==That long to move.

**CYM.**
==32==           I thank you. Let’s withdraw,
==33==And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
==34==What can from Italy annoy us, but
==35==We grieve at chances here. Away!

*Exeunt all but Pisanio.*

**PIS.**
==36==I heard no letter from my master since
==37==I wrote him Imogen was slain. ’Tis strange.
==38==Nor hear I from my mistress, who did promise
==39==To yield me often tidings. Neither know I
==40==What is betide to Cloten, but remain
==41==Perplex’d in all. The heavens still must work.
==42==Wherein I am false, I am honest; not true, to be true.
==43==These present wars shall find I love my country,
==44==Even to the note o’ th’ King, or I’ll fall in them.
==45==All other doubts, by time let them be clear’d,
==46==Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer’d.

*Exit.*
