## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Britain. An antechamber adjoining Imogen’s apartment in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Cloten and Lords.*

**1. LORD.**
==1==Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the most coldest that ever turn’d up ace.

**CLO.**
==2==It would make any man cold to lose.

**1. LORD.**
==3==But not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.

**CLO.**
==4==Winning will put any man into courage. If I could get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough. It’s almost morning, is’t not?

**1. LORD.**
==5==Day, my lord.

**CLO.**
==6==I would this music would come. I am advis’d to give her music a’ mornings; they say it will penetrate.
*(Enter Musicians.)*
==7==Come on, tune. If you can penetrate her with your fingering, so; we’ll try with tongue too. If none will do, let her remain; but I’ll never give o’er. First, a very excellent good conceited thing; after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich words to it—and then let her consider.

**SING.**
*(Song.)*
==8==*Hark, hark, the lark at heaven’s gate sings,*
==9==*And Phoebus gins arise,*
==10==*His steeds to water at those springs*
==11==*On chalic’d flow’rs that lies;*
==12==*And winking Mary-buds begin to ope*
==13==*their golden eyes;*
==14==*With every thing that pretty is, my lady sweet, arise:*
==15==*Arise, arise!*

**CLO.**
==16==So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will consider your music the better; if it do not, it is a vice in her ears, which horsehairs and calves’-guts, nor the voice of unpav’d eunuch to boot, can never amend.

*Exeunt Musicians.*

*Enter Cymbeline and Queen.*

**2. LORD.**
==17==Here comes the King.

**CLO.**
==18==I am glad I was up so late, for that’s the reason I was up so early. He cannot choose but take this service I have done fatherly.—Good morrow to your Majesty, and to my gracious mother!

**CYM.**
==19==Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
==20==Will she not forth?

**CLO.**
==21==I have assail’d her with musics, but she vouchsafes no notice.

**CYM.**
==22==The exile of her minion is too new,
==23==She hath not yet forgot him. Some more time
==24==Must wear the print of his remembrance on’t,
==25==And then she’s yours.

**QUEEN.**
==25==           You are most bound to th’ King,
==26==Who lets go by no vantages that may
==27==Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
==28==To orderly solicits, and be friended
==29==With aptness of the season; make denials
==30==Increase your services; so seem as if
==31==You were inspir’d to do those duties which
==32==You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
==33==Save when command to your dismission tends,
==34==And therein you are senseless.

**CLO.**
==34==                Senseless? Not so.

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
==35==So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
==36==The one is Caius Lucius.

**CYM.**
==36==              A worthy fellow,
==37==Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
==38==But that’s no fault of his. We must receive him
==39==According to the honor of his sender,
==40==And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
==41==We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
==42==When you have given good morning to your mistress,
==43==Attend the Queen and us; we shall have need
==44==T’ employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.

*Exeunt all but Cloten.*

**CLO.**
==45==If she be up, I’ll speak with her; if not,
==46==Let her lie still and dream.
*(Knocks.)*
==46==              By your leave ho!
==47==I know her women are about her; what
==48==If I do line one of their hands? ’Tis gold
==49==Which buys admittance (oft it doth), yea, and makes
==50==Diana’s rangers false themselves, yield up
==51==Their deer to th’ stand o’ th’ stealer; and ’tis gold
==52==Which makes the true man kill’d and saves the thief;
==53==Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man. What
==54==Can it not do, and undo? I will make
==55==One of her women lawyer to me, for
==56==I yet not understand the case myself.
==57==By your leave.

*Knocks.*

*Enter Helen.*

**HEL.**
==58==Who’s there that knocks?

**CLO.**
==58==              A gentleman.

**HEL.**
==58==                       No more?

**CLO.**
==59==Yes, and a gentlewoman’s son.

**HEL.**
==59==                That’s more
==60==Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
==61==Can justly boast of. What’s your lordship’s pleasure?

**CLO.**
==62==Your lady’s person. Is she ready?

**HEL.**
==62==                  Ay,
==63==To keep her chamber.

**CLO.**
==63==           There is gold for you,
==64==Sell me your good report.

**HEL.**
==65==How, my good name? Or to report of you
==66==What I shall think is good?—The Princess.

*Enter Imogen.*

**CLO.**
==67==Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.

*Exit Helen.*

**IMO.**
==68==Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
==69==For purchasing but trouble. The thanks I give
==70==Is telling you that I am poor of thanks,
==71==And scarce can spare them.

**CLO.**
==71==              Still I swear I love you.

**IMO.**
==72==If you but said so, ’twere as deep with me.
==73==If you swear still, your recompense is still
==74==That I regard it not.

**CLO.**
==74==           This is no answer.

**IMO.**
==75==But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
==76==I would not speak. I pray you spare me. Faith,
==77==I shall unfold equal discourtesy
==78==To your best kindness; one of your great knowing
==79==Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

**CLO.**
==80==To leave you in your madness, ’twere my sin;
==81==I will not.

**IMO.**
==82==Fools are not mad folks.

**CLO.**
==82==              Do you call me fool?

**IMO.**
==83==As I am mad, I do.
==84==If you’ll be patient, I’ll no more be mad;
==85==That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
==86==You put me to forget a lady’s manners
==87==By being so verbal; and learn now, for all,
==88==That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce
==89==By th’ very truth of it, I care not for you,
==90==And am so near the lack of charity
==91==To accuse myself I hate you; which I had rather
==92==You felt than make’t my boast.

**CLO.**
==92==                You sin against
==93==Obedience, which you owe your father. For
==94==The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
==95==One bred of alms and foster’d with cold dishes,
==96==With scraps o’ th’ court, it is no contract, none;
==97==And though it be allowed in meaner parties
==98==(Yet who than he more mean?) to knit their souls
==99==(On whom there is no more dependency
==100==But brats and beggary) in self-figur’d knot,
==101==Yet you are curb’d from that enlargement by
==102==The consequence o’ th’ crown, and must not foil
==103==The precious note of it with a base slave,
==104==A hilding for a livery, a squire’s cloth,
==105==A pantler—not so eminent.

**IMO.**
==105==              Profane fellow!
==106==Wert thou the son of Jupiter, and no more
==107==But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
==108==To be his groom. Thou wert dignified enough,
==109==Even to the point of envy, if ’twere made
==110==Comparative for your virtues, to be styl’d
==111==The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
==112==For being preferr’d so well.

**CLO.**
==112==              The south-fog rot him!

**IMO.**
==113==He never can meet more mischance than come
==114==To be but nam’d of thee. His mean’st garment
==115==That ever hath but clipt his body, is dearer
==116==In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
==117==Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio?

*Enter Pisanio.*

**CLO.**
==118==“His garments”? Now the devil⁠—

**IMO.**
==119==To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently.

**CLO.**
==120==“His garment”?

**IMO.**
==120==        I am sprited with a fool,
==121==Frighted, and ang’red worse. Go bid my woman
==122==Search for a jewel that too casually
==123==Hath left mine arm. It was thy master’s. Shrew me
==124==If I would lose it for a revenue
==125==Of any king’s in Europe! I do think
==126==I saw’t this morning; confident I am,
==127==Last night ’twas on mine arm; I kiss’d it:
==128==I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
==129==That I kiss aught but he.

**PIS.**
==129==              ’Twill not be lost.

**IMO.**
==130==I hope so; go and search.

*Exit Pisanio.*

**CLO.**
==130==              You have abus’d me.
==131==“His meanest garment”?

**IMO.**
==131==              Ay, I said so, sir;
==132==If you will make’t an action, call witness to’t.

**CLO.**
==133==I will inform your father.

**IMO.**
==133==              Your mother too.
==134==She’s my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
==135==But the worst of me. So I leave you, sir,
==136==To th’ worst of discontent.

*Exit.*

**CLO.**
==136==                I’ll be reveng’d.
==137==“His mean’st garment”? Well.

*Exit.*
