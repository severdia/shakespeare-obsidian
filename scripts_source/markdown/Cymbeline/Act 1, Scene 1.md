## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Britain. The garden of Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter two Gentlemen.*

**1. GENT.**
==1==You do not meet a man but frowns. Our bloods
==2==No more obey the heavens than our courtiers’
==3==Still seem as does the King’s.

**2. GENT.**
==3==                But what’s the matter?

**1. GENT.**
==4==His daughter, and the heir of ’s kingdom (whom
==5==He purpos’d to his wive’s sole son—a widow
==6==That late he married), hath referr’d herself
==7==Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded,
==8==Her husband banish’d, she imprison’d: all
==9==Is outward sorrow, though I think the King
==10==Be touch’d at very heart.

**2. GENT.**
==10==              None but the King?

**1. GENT.**
==11==He that hath lost her too; so is the Queen,
==12==That most desir’d the match. But not a courtier,
==13==Although they wear their faces to the bent
==14==Of the King’s looks, hath a heart that is not
==15==Glad at the thing they scowl at.

**2. GENT.**
==15==                  And why so?

**1. GENT.**
==16==He that hath miss’d the Princess is a thing
==17==Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her
==18==(I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
==19==And therefore banish’d) is a creature such
==20==As, to seek through the regions of the earth
==21==For one his like, there would be something failing
==22==In him that should compare. I do not think
==23==So fair an outward and such stuff within
==24==Endows a man but he.

**2. GENT.**
==24==           You speak him far.

**1. GENT.**
==25==I do extend him, sir, within himself,
==26==Crush him together rather than unfold
==27==His measure duly.

**2. GENT.**
==27==           What’s his name and birth?

**1. GENT.**
==28==I cannot delve him to the root: his father
==29==Was call’d Sicilius, who did join his honor
==30==Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
==31==But had his titles by Tenantius, whom
==32==He serv’d with glory and admir’d success:
==33==So gain’d the sur-addition Leonatus;
==34==And had (besides this gentleman in question) 
==35==Two other sons, who in the wars o’ th’ time
==36==Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,
==37==Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
==38==That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
==39==Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas’d
==40==As he was born. The King he takes the babe
==41==To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
==42==Breeds him and makes him of his bedchamber,
==43==Puts to him all the learnings that his time
==44==Could make him the receiver of, which he took,
==45==As we do air, fast as ’twas minist’red,
==46==And in ’s spring became a harvest; liv’d in court
==47==(Which rare it is to do) most prais’d, most lov’d,
==48==A sample to the youngest, to th’ more mature
==49==A glass that feated them, and to the graver
==50==A child that guided dotards. To his mistress
==51==(For whom he now is banish’d), her own price
==52==Proclaims how she esteem’d him; and his virtue
==53==By her election may be truly read,
==54==What kind of man he is.

**2. GENT.**
==54==              I honor him
==55==Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,
==56==Is she sole child to th’ King?

**1. GENT.**
==56==                His only child.
==57==He had two sons (if this be worth your hearing,
==58==Mark it), the eldest of them at three years old,
==59==I’ th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery
==60==Were stol’n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
==61==Which way they went.

**2. GENT.**
==61==           How long is this ago?

**1. GENT.**
==62==Some twenty years.

**2. GENT.**
==63==That a king’s children should be so convey’d,
==64==So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
==65==That could not trace them!

**1. GENT.**
==65==              Howsoe’er ’tis strange,
==66==Or that the negligence may well be laugh’d at,
==67==Yet is it true, sir.

**2. GENT.**
==67==        I do well believe you.

**1. GENT.**
==68==We must forbear. Here comes the gentleman,
==69==The Queen, and Princess.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter the Queen, Posthumus, and Imogen.*

**QUEEN.**
==70==No, be assur’d you shall not find me, daughter,
==71==After the slander of most stepmothers,
==72==Evil-ey’d unto you. You’re my prisoner, but
==73==Your jailer shall deliver you the keys
==74==That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
==75==So soon as I can win th’ offended King,
==76==I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet
==77==The fire of rage is in him, and ’twere good
==78==You lean’d unto his sentence with what patience
==79==Your wisdom may inform you.

**POST.**
==79==                  Please your Highness,
==80==I will from hence today.

**QUEEN.**
==80==              You know the peril,
==81==I’ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
==82==The pangs of barr’d affections, though the King
==83==Hath charg’d you should not speak together.

*Exit.*

**IMO.**
==83==                         O
==84==Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
==85==Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
==86==I something fear my father’s wrath, but nothing
==87==(Always reserv’d my holy duty) what
==88==His rage can do on me. You must be gone,
==89==And I shall here abide the hourly shot
==90==Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
==91==But that there is this jewel in the world
==92==That I may see again.

**POST.**
==92==           My queen, my mistress!
==93==O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
==94==To be suspected of more tenderness
==95==Than doth become a man. I will remain
==96==The loyall’st husband that did e’er plight troth.
==97==My residence in Rome at one Philario’s,
==98==Who to my father was a friend, to me
==99==Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,
==100==And with mine eyes I’ll drink the words you send,
==101==Though ink be made of gall.

*Enter Queen.*

**QUEEN.**
==101==                Be brief, I pray you.
==102==If the King come, I shall incur I know not
==103==How much of his displeasure.
*(Aside.)*
==103==                Yet I’ll move him
==104==To walk this way. I never do him wrong
==105==But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
==106==Pays dear for my offenses.

*Exit.*

**POST.**
==106==              Should we be taking leave
==107==As long a term as yet we have to live,
==108==The loathness to depart would grow. *Adieu*!

**IMO.**
==109==Nay, stay a little:
==110==Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
==111==Such parting were too petty. Look here, love,
==112==This diamond was my mother’s. Take it, heart,
==113==But keep it till you woo another wife,
==114==When Imogen is dead.

**POST.**
==114==           How, how? Another?
==115==You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
==116==And cere up my embracements from a next
==117==With bonds of death!
*(Puts on the ring.)*
==118==Remain, remain thou here,
==119==While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
==120==As I my poor self did exchange for you,
==121==To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
==122==I still win of you. For my sake wear this:
==123==It is a manacle of love, I’ll place it
==124==Upon this fairest prisoner.

*Putting a bracelet upon her arm.*

**IMO.**
==124==              O the gods!
==125==When shall we see again?

*Enter Cymbeline and Lords.*

**POST.**
==125==              Alack, the King!

**CYM.**
==126==Thou basest thing, avoid hence, from my sight!
==127==If after this command thou fraught the court
==128==With thy unworthiness, thou diest. Away!
==129==Thou’rt poison to my blood.

**POST.**
==129==              The gods protect you,
==130==And bless the good remainders of the court!
==131==I am gone.

*Exit.*

**IMO.**
==131==        There cannot be a pinch in death
==132==More sharp than this is.

**CYM.**
==132==              O disloyal thing,
==133==That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap’st
==134==A year’s age on me.

**IMO.**
==134==           I beseech you, sir,
==135==Harm not yourself with your vexation,
==136==I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
==137==Subdues all pangs, all fears.

**CYM.**
==137==              Past grace? Obedience?

**IMO.**
==138==Past hope, and in despair, that way past grace.

**CYM.**
==139==That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

**IMO.**
==140==O blessed, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
==141==And did avoid a puttock.

**CYM.**
==142==Thou took’st a beggar, wouldst have made my throne
==143==A seat for baseness.

**IMO.**
==143==           No, I rather added
==144==A luster to it.

**CYM.**
==144==        O thou vild one!

**IMO.**
==144==                  Sir,
==145==It is your fault that I have lov’d Posthumus:
==146==You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
==147==A man worth any woman; overbuys me
==148==Almost the sum he pays.

**CYM.**
==148==              What? Art thou mad?

**IMO.**
==149==Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
==150==A neat-herd’s daughter, and my Leonatus
==151==Our neighbor shepherd’s son!

*Enter Queen.*

**CYM.**
==151==                  Thou foolish thing!
*(To the Queen.)*
==152==They were again together; you have done
==153==Not after our command. Away with her,
==154==And pen her up.

**QUEEN.**
==154==        Beseech your patience. Peace,
==155==Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
==156==Leave us to ourselves, and make yourself some comfort
==157==Out of your best advice.

**CYM.**
==157==              Nay, let her languish
==158==A drop of blood a day, and being aged
==159==Die of this folly!

*Exit with Lords.*

*Enter Pisanio.*

**QUEEN.**
==159==           Fie, you must give way.
==160==Here is your servant. How now, sir? What news?

**PIS.**
==161==My lord your son drew on my master.

**QUEEN.**
==161==                     Hah?
==162==No harm, I trust, is done?

**PIS.**
==162==              There might have been,
==163==But that my master rather play’d than fought
==164==And had no help of anger. They were parted
==165==By gentlemen at hand.

**QUEEN.**
==165==           I am very glad on’t.

**IMO.**
==166==Your son’s my father’s friend, he takes his part
==167==To draw upon an exile. O brave sir!
==168==I would they were in Afric both together,
==169==Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
==170==The goer-back. Why came you from your master?

**PIS.**
==171==On his command. He would not suffer me
==172==To bring him to the haven; left these notes
==173==Of what commands I should be subject to,
==174==When’t pleas’d you to employ me.

**QUEEN.**
==174==                  This hath been
==175==Your faithful servant. I dare lay mine honor
==176==He will remain so.

**PIS.**
==176==           I humbly thank your Highness.

**QUEEN.**
==177==Pray walk awhile.

**IMO.**
*(To Pisanio.)*
==177==           About some half hour hence,
==178==Pray you speak with me. You shall, at least,
==179==Go see my lord aboard. For this time leave me.

*Exeunt.*
