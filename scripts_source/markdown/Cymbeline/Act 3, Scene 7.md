## Act 3, Scene 7
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. A public place.*

*Enter two Roman Senators and Tribunes.*

**1. SEN.**
==1== This is the tenor of the Emperor’s writ:
==2== That since the common men are now in action
==3== ’Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
==4== And that the legions now in Gallia are
==5== Full weak to undertake our wars against
==6== The fall’n-off Britains, that we do incite
==7== The gentry to this business. He creates
==8== Lucius proconsul; and to you the tribunes,
==9== For this immediate levy, he commands
==10== His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!

**TRIB.**
==11== Is Lucius general of the forces?

**2. SEN.**
==11==                   Ay.

**TRIB.**
==12== Remaining now in Gallia?

**1. SEN.**
==12==               With those legions
==13== Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
==14== Must be supplyant. The words of your commission
==15== Will tie you to the numbers and the time
==16== Of their dispatch.

**TRIB.**
==16==            We will discharge our duty.

*Exeunt.*
