## Act 3, Scene 7
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. A public place.*

*Enter two Roman Senators and Tribunes.*

**1. SEN.**
This is the tenor of the Emperor’s writ:
That since the common men are now in action
’Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
And that the legions now in Gallia are
Full weak to undertake our wars against
The fall’n-off Britains, that we do incite
The gentry to this business. He creates
Lucius proconsul; and to you the tribunes,
For this immediate levy, he commands
His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!

**TRIB.**
Is Lucius general of the forces?

**2. SEN.**
                  Ay.

**TRIB.**
Remaining now in Gallia?

**1. SEN.**
              With those legions
Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
Must be supplyant. The words of your commission
Will tie you to the numbers and the time
Of their dispatch.

**TRIB.**
           We will discharge our duty.

*Exeunt.*
