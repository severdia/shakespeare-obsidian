## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Britain. A room in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Pisanio reading of a letter.*

**PIS.**
==1==How? Of adultery? Wherefore write you not
==2==What monsters her accuse? Leonatus!
==3==O master, what a strange infection
==4==Is fall’n into thy ear! What false Italian
==5==(As poisonous tongu’d as handed) hath prevail’d
==6==On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal? No.
==7==She’s punish’d for her truth, and undergoes,
==8==More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
==9==As would take in some virtue. O my master,
==10==Thy mind to her is now as low as were
==11==Thy fortunes. How? That I should murder her,
==12==Upon the love and truth and vows which I
==13==Have made to thy command? I, her? Her blood?
==14==If it be so to do good service, never
==15==Let me be counted serviceable. How look I
==16==That I should seem to lack humanity
==17==So much as this fact comes to?
*(Reading.)*
==18==*“Do’t; the letter*
==19==*That I have sent her, by her own command*
==20==*Shall give thee opportunity.”*
==21==O damn’d paper,
==22==Black as the ink that’s on thee! Senseless bauble,
==23==Art thou a feodary for this act, and look’st
==24==So virgin-like without? Lo here she comes.
*(Enter Imogen.)*
==25==I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

**IMO.**
==26==How now, Pisanio?

**PIS.**
==27==Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

**IMO.**
==28==Who, thy lord? That is my lord Leonatus?
==29==O, learn’d indeed were that astronomer
==30==That knew the stars as I his characters;
==31==He’ld lay the future open. You good gods,
==32==Let what is here contain’d relish of love,
==33==Of my lord’s health, of his content—yet not
==34==That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
==35==Some griefs are med’cinable, that is one of them,
==36==For it doth physic love—of his content,
==37==All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
==38==You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
==39==And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike;
==40==Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
==41==You clasp young Cupid’s tables. Good news, gods!
*(Reads.)*
==42==*“Justice, and your father’s wrath, should he take me in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me as you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria, at Milford-Haven; what your own love will out of this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your increasing in love.*
==43==*Leonatus Posthumus.”*
==44==O for a horse with wings! Hear’st thou, Pisanio?
==45==He is at Milford-Haven. Read, and tell me
==46==How far ’tis thither. If one of mean affairs
==47==May plod it in a week, why may not I
==48==Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,
==49==Who long’st like me to see thy lord; who long’st
==50==(O let me bate!)—but not like me—yet long’st,
==51==But in a fainter kind—O, not like me,
==52==For mine’s beyond beyond—say, and speak thick
==53==(Love’s counselor should fill the bores of hearing,
==54==To th’ smothering of the sense), how far it is
==55==To this same blessed Milford. And by th’ way
==56==Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
==57==T’ inherit such a haven. But first of all,
==58==How we may steal from hence; and for the gap
==59==That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
==60==And our return, to excuse. But first, how get hence.
==61==Why should excuse be born or ere begot?
==62==We’ll talk of that hereafter. Prithee speak,
==63==How many score of miles may we well rid
==64==’Twixt hour and hour?

**PIS.**
==64==           One score ’twixt sun and sun,
==65==Madam, ’s enough for you—and too much too.

**IMO.**
==66==Why, one that rode to ’s execution, man,
==67==Could never go so slow. I have heard of riding wagers,
==68==Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
==69==That run i’ th’ clock’s behalf. But this is fool’ry.
==70==Go, bid my woman feign a sickness, say
==71==She’ll home to her father; and provide me presently
==72==A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
==73==A franklin’s huswife.

**PIS.**
==73==           Madam, you’re best consider.

**IMO.**
==74==I see before me, man; nor here, nor here,
==75==Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them
==76==That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee,
==77==Do as I bid thee. There’s no more to say:
==78==Accessible is none but Milford way.

*Exeunt.*
