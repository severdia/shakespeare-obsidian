## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Rome. Philario’s house.*

*Enter Posthumus and Philario.*

**POST.**
==1==Fear it not, sir. I would I were so sure
==2==To win the King as I am bold her honor
==3==Will remain hers.

**PHI.**
==3==        What means do you make to him?

**POST.**
==4==Not any; but abide the change of time,
==5==Quake in the present winter’s state, and wish
==6==That warmer days would come. In these fear’d hopes
==7==I barely gratify your love; they failing,
==8==I must die much your debtor.

**PHI.**
==9==Your very goodness and your company
==10==O’erpays all I can do. By this, your king
==11==Hath heard of great Augustus. Caius Lucius
==12==Will do ’s commission throughly. And I think
==13==He’ll grant the tribute, send th’ arrearages,
==14==Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
==15==Is yet fresh in their grief.

**POST.**
==15==              I do believe
==16==(Statist though I am none, nor like to be) 
==17==That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
==18==The legion now in Gallia sooner landed
==19==In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
==20==Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
==21==Are men more order’d than when Julius Caesar
==22==Smil’d at their lack of skill, but found their courage
==23==Worthy his frowning at. Their discipline
==24==(Now wing-led with their courages) will make known
==25==To their approvers they are people such
==26==That mend upon the world.

*Enter Jachimo.*

**PHI.**
==26==              See! Jachimo!

**POST.**
==27==The swiftest harts have posted you by land,
==28==And winds of all the corners kiss’d your sails,
==29==To make your vessel nimble.

**PHI.**
==29==                Welcome, sir.

**POST.**
==30==I hope the briefness of your answer made
==31==The speediness of your return.

**JACH.**
==31==                Your lady
==32==Is one of the fairest that I have look’d upon.

**POST.**
==33==And therewithal the best, or let her beauty
==34==Look thorough a casement to allure false hearts,
==35==And be false with them.

**JACH.**
==35==              Here are letters for you.

**POST.**
==36==Their tenure good, I trust.

**JACH.**
==36==              ’Tis very like.

**PHI.**
==37==Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
==38==When you were there?

**JACH.**
==38==           He was expected then,
==39==But not approach’d.

**POST.**
==39==           All is well yet.
==40==Sparkles this stone as it was wont, or is’t not
==41==Too dull for your good wearing?

**JACH.**
==41==                  If I have lost it,
==42==I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
==43==I’ll make a journey twice as far, t’ enjoy
==44==A second night of such sweet shortness which
==45==Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.

**POST.**
==46==The stone’s too hard to come by.

**JACH.**
==46==                  Not a whit,
==47==Your lady being so easy.

**POST.**
==47==              Make not, sir,
==48==Your loss your sport. I hope you know that we
==49==Must not continue friends.

**JACH.**
==49==              Good sir, we must,
==50==If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
==51==The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
==52==We were to question farther; but I now
==53==Profess myself the winner of her honor,
==54==Together with your ring; and not the wronger
==55==Of her or you, having proceeded but
==56==By both your wills.

**POST.**
==56==           If you can make’t apparent
==57==That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
==58==And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion
==59==You had of her pure honor gains or loses
==60==Your sword or mine, or masterless leave both
==61==To who shall find them.

**JACH.**
==61==              Sir, my circumstances,
==62==Being so near the truth as I will make them,
==63==Must first induce you to believe; whose strength
==64==I will confirm with oath, which I doubt not
==65==You’ll give me leave to spare when you shall find
==66==You need it not.

**POST.**
==66==        Proceed.

**JACH.**
==66==              First, her bedchamber
==67==(Where I confess I slept not, but profess
==68==Had that was well worth watching), it was hang’d
==69==With tapestry of silk and silver; the story
==70==Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
==71==And Cydnus swell’d above the banks, or for
==72==The press of boats or pride. A piece of work
==73==So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
==74==In workmanship and value, which I wonder’d
==75==Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
==76==Since the true life on’t was⁠—

**POST.**
==76==              This is true;
==77==And this you might have heard of here, by me,
==78==Or by some other.

**JACH.**
==78==           More particulars
==79==Must justify my knowledge.

**POST.**
==79==              So they must,
==80==Or do your honor injury.

**JACH.**
==80==              The chimney
==81==Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
==82==Chaste Dian bathing. Never saw I figures
==83==So likely to report themselves. The cutter
==84==Was as another Nature, dumb; outwent her,
==85==Motion and breath left out.

**POST.**
==85==              This is a thing
==86==Which you might from relation likewise reap,
==87==Being, as it is, much spoke of.

**JACH.**
==87==           The roof o’ th’ chamber
==88==With golden cherubins is fretted. Her andirons
==89==(I had forgot them) were two winking Cupids
==90==Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
==91==Depending on their brands.

**POST.**
==91==              This is her honor!
==92==Let it be granted you have seen all this (and praise
==93==Be given to your remembrance), the description
==94==Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
==95==The wager you have laid.

**JACH.**
==95==              Then if you can
*(Showing the bracelet.)*
==96==Be pale, I beg but leave to air this jewel. See!
==97==And now ’tis up again. It must be married
==98==To that your diamond, I’ll keep them.

**POST.**
==98==                     Jove⁠—
==99==Once more let me behold it. Is it that
==100==Which I left with her?

**JACH.**
==100==           Sir (I thank her), that.
==101==She stripp’d it from her arm. I see her yet:
==102==Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
==103==And yet enrich’d it too. She gave it me, and said
==104==She priz’d it once.

**POST.**
==104==           May be she pluck’d it off
==105==To send it me.

**JACH.**
==105==        She writes so to you? Doth she?

**POST.**
==106==O no, no, no, ’tis true. Here, take this too,
*(Gives the ring.)*
==107==It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
==108==Kills me to look on’t. Let there be no honor
==109==Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,
==110==Where there’s another man. The vows of women
==111==Of no more bondage be to where they are made
==112==Than they are to their virtues, which is nothing.
==113==O, above measure false!

**PHI.**
==113==              Have patience, sir,
==114==And take your ring again, ’tis not yet won.
==115==It may be probable she lost it; or
==116==Who knows if one her women, being corrupted,
==117==Hath stol’n it from her?

**POST.**
==117==              Very true,
==118==And so I hope he came by’t. Back my ring!
==119==Render to me some corporal sign about her,
==120==More evident than this; for this was stol’n.

**JACH.**
==121==By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.

**POST.**
==122==Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
==123==’Tis true—nay, keep the ring—’tis true. I am sure
==124==She would not lose it. Her attendants are
==125==All sworn and honorable. They induc’d to steal it?
==126==And by a stranger? No, he hath enjoye’d her.
==127==The cognizance of her incontinency
==128==Is this. She hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.
==129==There, take thy hire, and all the fiends of hell
==130==Divide themselves between you!

**PHI.**
==130==                  Sir, be patient.
==131==This is not strong enough to be believ’d
==132==Of one persuaded well of.

**POST.**
==132==              Never talk on’t:
==133==She hath been colted by him.

**JACH.**
==133==                If you seek
==134==For further satisfying, under her breast
==135==(Worthy her pressing) lies a mole, right proud
==136==Of that most delicate lodging. By my life,
==137==I kiss’d it, and it gave me present hunger
==138==To feed again, though full. You do remember
==139==This stain upon her?

**POST.**
==139==           Ay, and it doth confirm
==140==Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
==141==Were there no more but it.

**JACH.**
==141==              Will you hear more?

**POST.**
==142==Spare your arithmetic, never count the turns.
==143==Once, and a million!

**JACH.**
==143==           I’ll be sworn.

**POST.**
==143==                  No swearing:
==144==If you will swear you have not done’t, you lie,
==145==And I will kill thee if thou dost deny
==146==Thou’st made me cuckold.

**JACH.**
==146==              I’ll deny nothing.

**POST.**
==147==O that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
==148==I will go there and do’t, i’ th’ court, before
==149==Her father. I’ll do something⁠—

*Exit.*

**PHI.**
==149==                  Quite besides
==150==The government of patience! You have won.
==151==Let’s follow him, and pervert the present wrath
==152==He hath against himself.

**JACH.**
==152==              With all my heart.

*Exeunt.*
