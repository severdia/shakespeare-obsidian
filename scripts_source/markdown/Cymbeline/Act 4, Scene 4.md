## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Wales. The forest near Belarius’ cave.*

*Enter Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.*

**GUI.**
==1==The noise is round about us.

**BEL.**
==1==              Let us from it.

**ARV.**
==2==What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
==3==From action and adventure?

**GUI.**
==3==              Nay, what hope
==4==Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans
==5==Must or for Britains slay us or receive us
==6==For barbarous and unnatural revolts
==7==During their use, and slay us after.

**BEL.**
==7==                  Sons,
==8==We’ll higher to the mountains, there secure us.
==9==To the King’s party there’s no going. Newness
==10==Of Cloten’s death (we being not known, not muster’d
==11==Among the bands) may drive us to a render
==12==Where we have liv’d, and so extort from ’s that
==13==Which we have done, whose answer would be death
==14==Drawn on with torture.

**GUI.**
==14==              This is, sir, a doubt
==15==In such a time nothing becoming you,
==16==Nor satisfying us.

**ARV.**
==16==           It is not likely
==17==That when they hear their Roman horses neigh,
==18==Behold their quarter’d fires, have both their eyes
==19==And ears so cloy’d importantly as now,
==20==That they will waste their time upon our note,
==21==To know from whence we are.

**BEL.**
==21==                O, I am known
==22==Of many in the army. Many years,
==23==Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
==24==From my remembrance. And besides, the King
==25==Hath not deserv’d my service nor your loves,
==26==Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
==27==The certainty of this hard life, aye hopeless
==28==To have the courtesy your cradle promis’d,
==29==But to be still hot summer’s tanlings and
==30==The shrinking slaves of winter.

**GUI.**
==30==                  Than be so,
==31==Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to th’ army.
==32==I and my brother are not known; yourself
==33==So out of thought, and thereto so o’ergrown,
==34==Cannot be question’d.

**ARV.**
==34==           By this sun that shines,
==35==I’ll thither. What thing is’t that I never
==36==Did see man die, scarce ever look’d on blood,
==37==But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
==38==Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
==39==A rider like myself, who ne’er wore rowel
==40==Nor iron on his heel! I am asham’d
==41==To look upon the holy sun, to have
==42==The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
==43==So long a poor unknown.

**GUI.**
==43==              By heavens, I’ll go.
==44==If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
==45==I’ll take the better care; but if you will not,
==46==The hazard therefore due fall on me by
==47==The hands of Romans!

**ARV.**
==47==              So say I, amen.

**BEL.**
==48==No reason I, since of your lives you set
==49==So slight a valuation, should reserve
==50==My crack’d one to more care. Have with you, boys!
==51==If in your country wars you chance to die,
==52==That is my bed too, lads, and there I’ll lie.
==53==Lead, lead!
*(Aside.)*
==54==The time seems long, their blood thinks scorn
==55==Till it fly out and show them princes born.

*Exeunt.*
