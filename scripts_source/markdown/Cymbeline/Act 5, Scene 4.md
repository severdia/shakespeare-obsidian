## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*Britain. A prison.*

*Enter Posthumus and two Jailers.*

**1. JAIL.**
==1==You shall not now be stol’n, you have locks upon you;
==2==So graze, as you find pasture.

**2. JAIL.**
==2==                Ay, or a stomach.

*Exeunt Jailers.*

**POST.**
==3==Most welcome, bondage! For thou art a way,
==4==I think, to liberty; yet am I better
==5==Than one that’s sick o’ th’ gout, since he had rather
==6==Groan so in perpetuity than be cur’d
==7==By th’ sure physician, death, who is the key
==8==T’ unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter’d
==9==More than my shanks and wrists. You good gods, give me
==10==The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
==11==Then free forever! Is’t enough I am sorry?
==12==So children temporal fathers do appease;
==13==Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent,
==14==I cannot do it better than in gyves,
==15==Desir’d more than constrain’d. To satisfy,
==16==If of my freedom ’tis the main part, take
==17==No stricter render of me than my all.
==18==I know you are more clement than vild men,
==19==Who of their broken debtors take a third,
==20==A sixt, a tenth, letting them thrive again
==21==On their abatement. That’s not my desire.
==22==For Imogen’s dear life take mine, and though
==23==’Tis not so dear, yet ’tis a life; you coin’d it.
==24==’Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
==25==Though light, take pieces for the figure’s sake;
==26==You rather, mine being yours; and so, great pow’rs,
==27==If you will take this audit, take this life,
==28==And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen,
==29==I’ll speak to thee in silence.

*Sleeps.*

*Solemn music.*

*Enter (as in an apparition) Sicilius Leonatus, father to Posthumus, an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient Matron, his wife and mother to Posthumus, with music before them.*

*Then, after other music, follows the two young Leonati, brothers to Posthumus, with wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus round as he lies sleeping.*

**SICI.**
==30==*No more, thou Thunder-master, show*
==31==*Thy spite on mortal flies:*
==32==*With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,*
==33==*That thy adulteries*
==34==*Rates and revenges.*
==35==*Hath my poor boy done aught but well,*
==36==*Whose face I never saw?*
==37==*I died whilst in the womb he stay’d*
==38==*Attending nature’s law;*
==39==*Whose father then (as men report*
==40==*Thou orphans’ father art) *
==41==*Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him*
==42==*From this earth-vexing smart.*

**MOTH.**
==43==*Lucina lent not me her aid,*
==44==*But took me in my throes,*
==45==*That from me was Posthumus ripp’d,*
==46==*Came crying ’mongst his foes,*
==47==*A thing of pity!*

**SICI.**
==48==*Great nature, like his ancestry,*
==49==*Moulded the stuff so fair,*
==50==*That he deserv’d the praise o’ th’ world,*
==51==*As great Sicilius’ heir.*

**APP. 1. BRO.**
==52==*When once he was mature for man,*
==53==*In Britain where was he*
==54==*That could stand up his parallel,*
==55==*Or fruitful object be*
==56==*In eye of Imogen, that best*
==57==*Could deem his dignity?*

**MOTH.**
==58==*With marriage wherefore was he mock’d,*
==59==*To be exil’d, and thrown*
==60==*From Leonati seat, and cast*
==61==*From her his dearest one,*
==62==*Sweet Imogen?*

**SICI.**
==63==*Why did you suffer Jachimo,*
==64==*Slight thing of Italy,*
==65==*To taint his nobler heart and brain*
==66==*With needless jealousy,*
==67==*And to become the geck and scorn*
==68==*O’ th’ other’s villainy?*

**APP. 2. BRO.**
==69==*For this from stiller seats we came,*
==70==*Our parents and us twain,*
==71==*That striking in our country’s cause*
==72==*Fell bravely and were slain,*
==73==*Our fealty and Tenantius’ right*
==74==*With honor to maintain.*

**APP. 1. BRO.**
==75==*Like hardiment Posthumus hath*
==76==*To Cymbeline perform’d.*
==77==*Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,*
==78==*Why hast thou thus adjourn’d*
==79==*The graces for his merits due,*
==80==*Being all to dolors turn’d?*

**SICI.**
==81==*Thy crystal window ope; look out;*
==82==*No longer exercise*
==83==*Upon a valiant race thy harsh*
==84==*And potent injuries.*

**MOTH.**
==85==*Since, Jupiter, our son is good,*
==86==*Take off his miseries.*

**SICI.**
==87==*Peep through thy marble mansion, help,*
==88==*Or we poor ghosts will cry*
==89==*To th’ shining synod of the rest*
==90==*Against thy deity.*

**BROTHERS.**
==91==*Help, Jupiter, or we appeal,*
==92==*And from thy justice fly.*

*Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The Ghosts fall on their knees.*

**JUP.**
==93==No more, you petty spirits of region low,
==94==Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
==95==Accuse the Thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
==96==Sky-planted, batters all rebelling coasts?
==97==Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
==98==Upon your never-withering banks of flow’rs.
==99==Be not with mortal accidents oppress’d,
==100==No care of yours it is, you know ’tis ours.
==101==Whom best I love, I cross; to make my gift,
==102==The more delay’d, delighted. Be content,
==103==Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift.
==104==His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
==105==Our Jovial star reign’d at his birth, and in
==106==Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
==107==He shall be lord of Lady Imogen,
==108==And happier much by his affliction made.
==109==This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
==110==Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine,
*(Jupiter drops a tablet.)*
==111==And so away! No farther with your din
==112==Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
==113==Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.

*Ascends.*

**SICI.**
==114==He came in thunder, his celestial breath
==115==Was sulfurous to smell; the holy eagle
==116==Stoop’d, as to foot us. His ascension is
==117==More sweet than our blest fields. His royal bird
==118==Prunes the immortal wing, and cloys his beak,
==119==As when his god is pleas’d.

**ALL GHOSTS**
==119==              Thanks, Jupiter!

**SICI.**
==120==The marble pavement closes, he is enter’d
==121==His radiant roof. Away, and, to be blest,
==122==Let us with care perform his great behest.

*The Ghosts vanish after placing the tablet on Posthumus’ breast.*

**POST.**
*(Waking.)*
==123==Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire and begot
==124==A father to me; and thou hast created
==125==A mother and two brothers. But (O scorn!) 
==126==Gone! They went hence so soon as they were born.
==127==And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
==128==On greatness’ favor dream as I have done,
==129==Wake, and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve.
==130==Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
==131==And yet are steep’d in favors; so am I,
==132==That have this golden chance and know not why.
==133==What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one,
==134==Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
==135==Nobler than that it covers! Let thy effects
==136==So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
==137==As good as promise!
*(Reads.)*
==138==*“When as a lion’s whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embrac’d by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp’d branches, which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and nourish in peace and plenty.”*
==139==’Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
==140==Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing,
==141==Or senseless speaking, or a speaking such
==142==As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
==143==The action of my life is like it, which
==144==I’ll keep, if but for sympathy.

*Enter First Jailer.*

**1. JAIL.**
==145==Come, sir, are you ready for death?

**POST.**
==146==Overroasted rather; ready long ago.

**1. JAIL.**
==147==Hanging is the word, sir. If you be ready for that, you are well cook’d.

**POST.**
==148==So if I prove a good repast to the spectators, the dish pays the shot.

**1. JAIL.**
==149==A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is, you shall be call’d to no more payments, fear no more tavern-bills, which are often the sadness of parting, as the procuring of mirth. You come in faint for want of meat, depart reeling with too much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain both empty; the brain the heavier for being too light, the purse too light, being drawn of heaviness. O, of this contradiction you shall now be quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up thousands in a trice. You have no true debitor and creditor but it: of what’s past, is, and to come, the discharge. Your neck, sir, is pen, book, and counters; so the acquittance follows.

**POST.**
==150==I am merrier to die than thou art to live.

**1. JAIL.**
==151==Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the toothache; but a man that were to sleep your sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he would change places with his officer; for, look you, sir, you know not which way you shall go.

**POST.**
==152==Yes indeed do I, fellow.

**1. JAIL.**
==153==Your death has eyes in’ s head then; I have not seen him so pictur’d. You must either be directed by some that take upon them to know, or to take upon yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or jump the after-inquiry on your own peril; and how you shall speed in your journey’s end, I think you’ll never return to tell one.

**POST.**
==154==I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and will not use them.

**1. JAIL.**
==155==What an infinite mock is this, that a man should have the best use of eyes to see the way of blindness! I am sure hanging’s the way of winking.

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
==156==Knock off his manacles, bring your prisoner to the King.

**POST.**
==157==Thou bring’st good news, I am call’d to be made free.

**1. JAIL.**
==158==I’ll be hang’d then.

**POST.**
==159==Thou shalt be then freer than a jailer; no bolts for the dead.

*Exeunt Posthumus and Messenger.*

**1. JAIL.**
==160==Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live, for all he be a Roman; and there be some of them too that die against their wills. So should I, if I were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one mind good. O, there were desolation of jailers and gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but my wish hath a preferment in’t.

*Exit.*
