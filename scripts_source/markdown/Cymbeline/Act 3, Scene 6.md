## Act 3, Scene 6
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 7|Act 3, Scene 7 →]]

*Wales. Before Belarius’ cave.*

*Enter Imogen alone in boy’s clothes.*

**IMO.**
==1==I see a man’s life is a tedious one,
==2==I have tir’d myself; and for two nights together
==3==Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
==4==But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
==5==When from the mountain top Pisanio show’d thee,
==6==Thou wast within a ken. O Jove, I think
==7==Foundations fly the wretched: such, I mean,
==8==Where they should be reliev’d. Two beggars told me
==9==I could not miss my way. Will poor folks lie,
==10==That have afflictions on them, knowing ’tis
==11==A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
==12==When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fullness
==13==Is sorer than to lie for need; and falsehood
==14==Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord,
==15==Thou art one o’ th’ false ones. Now I think on thee,
==16==My hunger’s gone; but even before, I was
==17==At point to sink for food. But what is this?
==18==Here is a path to’t; ’tis some savage hold.
==19==I were best not call; I dare not call; yet famine,
==20==Ere clean it o’erthrow nature, makes it valiant.
==21==Plenty and peace breeds cowards; hardness ever
==22==Of hardiness is mother. Ho! Who’s here?
==23==If any thing that’s civil, speak; if savage,
==24==Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I’ll enter.
==25==Best draw my sword; and if mine enemy
==26==But fear the sword like me, he’ll scarcely look on’t.
==27==Such a foe, good heavens!

*Exit to the cave.*

*Enter Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.*

**BEL.**
==28==You, Polydore, have prov’d best woodman, and
==29==Are master of the feast. Cadwal and I
==30==Will play the cook and servant, ’tis our match.
==31==The sweat of industry would dry and die,
==32==But for the end it works to. Come, our stomachs
==33==Will make what’s homely savory; weariness
==34==Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
==35==Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
==36==Poor house, that keep’st thyself!

**GUI.**
==36==                  I am throughly weary.

**ARV.**
==37==I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.

**GUI.**
==38==There is cold meat i’ th’ cave, we’ll browse on that
==39==Whilst what we have kill’d be cook’d.

**BEL.**
*(Looking into the cave.)*
==39==                     Stay, come not in.
==40==But that it eats our victuals, I should think
==41==Here were a fairy.

**GUI.**
==41==           What’s the matter, sir?

**BEL.**
==42==By Jupiter, an angel! Or if not,
==43==An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
==44==No elder than a boy!

*Enter Imogen.*

**IMO.**
==45==Good masters, harm me not.
==46==Before I enter’d here I call’d, and thought
==47==To have begg’d or bought what I have took. Good troth,
==48==I have stol’n nought, nor would not, though I had found
==49==Gold strew’d i’ th’ floor. Here’s money for my meat,
==50==I would have left it on the board so soon
==51==As I had made my meal, and parted with
==52==Pray’rs for the provider.

**GUI.**
==52==              Money, youth?

**ARV.**
==53==All gold and silver rather turn to dirt,
==54==As ’tis no better reckon’d, but of those
==55==Who worship dirty gods.

**IMO.**
==55==              I see you’re angry.
==56==Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
==57==Have died had I not made it.

**BEL.**
==57==                Whither bound?

**IMO.**
==58==To Milford-Haven.

**BEL.**
==59==What’s your name?

**IMO.**
==60==Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
==61==Is bound for Italy; he embark’d at Milford;
==62==To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
==63==I am fall’n in this offense.

**BEL.**
==63==              Prithee, fair youth,
==64==Think us no churls; nor measure our good minds
==65==By this rude place we live in. Well encounter’d!
==66==’Tis almost night, you shall have better cheer
==67==Ere you depart, and thanks to stay and eat it.
==68==Boys, bid him welcome.

**GUI.**
==68==              Were you a woman, youth,
==69==I should woo hard but be your groom in honesty:
==70==I bid for you as I do buy.

**ARV.**
==70==              I’ll make’t my comfort
==71==He is a man, I’ll love him as my brother:
==72==And such a welcome as I’ld give to him
==73==After long absence, such is yours. Most welcome!
==74==Be sprightly, for you fall ’mongst friends.

**IMO.**
*(Aside.)*
==74==                     ’Mongst friends?
==75==If brothers: would it had been so, that they
==76==Had been my father’s sons, then had my prize
==77==Been less, and so more equal ballasting
==78==To thee, Posthumus.

**BEL.**
==78==           He wrings at some distress.

**GUI.**
==79==Would I could free’t!

**ARV.**
==79==           Or I, what e’er it be,
==80==What pain it cost, what danger. Gods!

**BEL.**
==80==                     Hark, boys.

*Whispering.*

**IMO.**
==81==Great men,
==82==That had a court no bigger than this cave,
==83==That did attend themselves and had the virtue
==84==Which their own conscience seal’d them, laying by
==85==That nothing-gift of differing multitudes,
==86==Could not outpeer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
==87==I’ld change my sex to be companion with them,
==88==Since Leonatus’ false.

**BEL.**
==88==           It shall be so.
==89==Boys, we’ll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in.
==90==Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp’d,
==91==We’ll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
==92==So far as thou wilt speak it.

**GUI.**
==92==              Pray draw near.

**ARV.**
==93==The night to th’ owl and morn to th’ lark less welcome.

**IMO.**
==94==Thanks, sir.

**ARV.**
==95==I pray draw near.

*Exeunt.*
