## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]]

*Cymbeline’s tent.*

*Enter Cymbeline, Belarius, Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio, and Lords, Officers, and Attendants.*

**CYM.**
==1==Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
==2==Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
==3==That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
==4==Whose rags sham’d gilded arms, whose naked breast
==5==Stepp’d before targes of proof, cannot be found.
==6==He shall be happy that can find him, if
==7==Our grace can make him so.

**BEL.**
==7==                I never saw
==8==Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
==9==Such precious deeds in one that promis’d nought
==10==But beggary and poor looks.

**CYM.**
==10==                No tidings of him?

**PIS.**
==11==He hath been search’d among the dead and living;
==12==But no trace of him.

**CYM.**
==12==           To my grief, I am
==13==The heir of his reward,
*(to Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus)*
==13==              which I will add
==14==To you, the liver, heart, and brain of Britain,
==15==By whom, I grant, she lives. ’Tis now the time
==16==To ask of whence you are. Report it.

**BEL.**
==16==                       Sir,
==17==In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen.
==18==Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
==19==Unless I add, we are honest.

**CYM.**
==19==                Bow your knees.
==20==Arise my knights o’ th’ battle. I create you
==21==Companions to our person, and will fit you
==22==With dignities becoming your estates.
*(Enter Cornelius and Ladies.)*
==23==There’s business in these faces. Why so sadly
==24==Greet you our victory? You look like Romans,
==25==And not o’ th’ court of Britain.

**COR.**
==25==                Hail, great King!
==26==To sour your happiness, I must report
==27==The Queen is dead.

**CYM.**
==27==           Who worse than a physician
==28==Would this report become? But I consider,
==29==By med’cine life may be prolong’d, yet death
==30==Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?

**COR.**
==31==With horror, madly dying, like her life,
==32==Which (being cruel to the world) concluded
==33==Most cruel to herself. What she confess’d
==34==I will report, so please you. These her women
==35==Can trip me, if I err, who with wet cheeks
==36==Were present when she finish’d.

**CYM.**
==36==                  Prithee say.

**COR.**
==37==First, she confess’d she never lov’d you; only
==38==Affected greatness got by you, not you;
==39==Married your royalty, was wife to your place,
==40==Abhorr’d your person.

**CYM.**
==40==              She alone knew this;
==41==And but she spoke it dying, I would not
==42==Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.

**COR.**
==43==Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
==44==With such integrity, she did confess
==45==Was as a scorpion to her sight, whose life,
==46==But that her flight prevented it, she had
==47==Ta’en off by poison.

**CYM.**
==47==           O most delicate fiend!
==48==Who is’t can read a woman? Is there more?

**COR.**
==49==More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
==50==For you a mortal mineral, which, being took,
==51==Should by the minute feed on life, and ling’ring,
==52==By inches waste you. In which time she purpos’d,
==53==By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
==54==O’ercome you with her show, and in time
==55==(When she had fitted you with her craft) to work
==56==Her son into th’ adoption of the crown;
==57==But failing of her end by his strange absence,
==58==Grew shameless desperate; open’d (in despite
==59==Of heaven and men) her purposes; repented
==60==The evils she hatch’d were not effected; so
==61==Despairing died.

**CYM.**
==61==        Heard you all this, her women?

**LADIES.**
==62==We did, so please your Highness.

**CYM.**
==62==                  Mine eyes
==63==Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
==64==Mine ears, that heard her flattery, nor my heart,
==65==That thought her like her seeming. It had been vicious
==66==To have mistrusted her; yet, O my daughter,
==67==That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
==68==And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
*(Enter Lucius, Jachimo, Philarmonus, and other Roman prisoners guarded; Leonatus Posthumus behind, and Imogen.)*
==69==Thou com’st not, Caius, now for tribute; that
==70==The Britains have ras’d out, though with the loss
==71==Of many a bold one, whose kinsmen have made suit
==72==That their good souls may be appeas’d with slaughter
==73==Of you their captives, which ourself have granted;
==74==So think of your estate.

**LUC.**
==75==Consider, sir, the chance of war, the day
==76==Was yours by accident. Had it gone with us,
==77==We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten’d
==78==Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
==79==Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
==80==May be call’d ransom, let it come. Sufficeth
==81==A Roman with a Roman’s heart can suffer.
==82==Augustus lives to think on’t; and so much
==83==For my peculiar care. This one thing only
==84==I will entreat: my boy, a Britain born,
==85==Let him be ransom’d. Never master had
==86==A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
==87==So tender over his occasions, true,
==88==So feat, so nurse-like. Let his virtue join
==89==With my request, which I’ll make bold your Highness
==90==Cannot deny. He hath done no Britain harm,
==91==Though he have serv’d a Roman. Save him, sir,
==92==And spare no blood beside.

**CYM.**
==92==              I have surely seen him;
==93==His favor is familiar to me. Boy,
==94==Thou hast look’d thyself into my grace,
==95==And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
==96==To say “Live, boy.” Ne’er thank thy master. Live;
==97==And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
==98==Fitting my bounty and thy state, I’ll give it;
==99==Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
==100==The noblest ta’en.

**IMO.**
==100==           I humbly thank your Highness.

**LUC.**
==101==I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad,
==102==And yet I know thou wilt.

**IMO.**
==102==              No, no, alack,
==103==There’s other work in hand. I see a thing
==104==Bitter to me as death; your life, good master,
==105==Must shuffle for itself.

**LUC.**
==105==              The boy disdains me,
==106==He leaves me, scorns me. Briefly die their joys
==107==That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
==108==Why stands he so perplex’d?

**CYM.**
==108==              What wouldst thou, boy?
==109==I love thee more and more; think more and more
==110==What’s best to ask. Know’st him thou look’st on? Speak,
==111==Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? Thy friend?

**IMO.**
==112==He is a Roman, no more kin to me
==113==Than I to your Highness; who, being born your vassal,
==114==Am something nearer.

**CYM.**
==114==              Wherefore ey’st him so?

**IMO.**
==115==I’ll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
==116==To give me hearing.

**CYM.**
==116==           Ay, with all my heart,
==117==And lend my best attention. What’s thy name?

**IMO.**
==118==Fidele, sir.

**CYM.**
==118==        Thou’rt my good youth—my page;
==119==I’ll be thy master. Walk with me; speak freely.

*Cymbeline and Imogen talk apart.*

**BEL.**
==120==Is not this boy reviv’d from death?

**ARV.**
==120==                  One sand another
==121==Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
==122==Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?

**GUI.**
==123==The same dead thing alive.

**BEL.**
==124==Peace, peace, see further. He eyes us not, forbear.
==125==Creatures may be alike; were’t he, I am sure
==126==He would have spoke to us.

**GUI.**
==126==              But we saw him dead.

**BEL.**
==127==Be silent; let’s see further.

**PIS.**
*(Aside.)*
==127==              It is my mistress.
==128==Since she is living, let the time run on
==129==To good or bad.

*Cymbeline and Imogen come forward.*

**CYM.**
==129==        Come, stand thou by our side,
==130==Make thy demand aloud.
*(To Jachimo.)*
==130==              Sir, step you forth;
==131==Give answer to this boy, and do it freely,
==132==Or by our greatness, and the grace of it
==133==(Which is our honor), bitter torture shall
==134==Winnow the truth from falsehood.—On, speak to him.

**IMO.**
==135==My boon is, that this gentleman may render
==136==Of whom he had this ring.

**POST.**
*(Aside.)*
==136==              What’s that to him?

**CYM.**
==137==That diamond upon your finger, say
==138==How came it yours?

**JACH.**
==139==Thou’lt torture me to leave unspoken that
==140==Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.

**CYM.**
==140==                       How? Me?

**JACH.**
==141==I am glad to be constrain’d to utter that
==142==Which torments me to conceal. By villainy
==143==I got this ring. ’Twas Leonatus’ jewel,
==144==Whom thou didst banish; and—which more may grieve thee,
==145==As it doth me—a nobler sir ne’er liv’d
==146==’Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

**CYM.**
==147==All that belongs to this.

**JACH.**
==147==           That paragon, thy daughter,
==148==For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
==149==Quail to remember—Give me leave, I faint.

**CYM.**
==150==My daughter? What of her? Renew thy strength;
==151==I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
==152==Than die ere I hear more. Strive, man, and speak.

**JACH.**
==153==Upon a time—unhappy was the clock
==154==That struck the hour!—it was in Rome—accurs’d
==155==The mansion where!—’twas at a feast—O would
==156==Our viands had been poison’d, or at least
==157==Those which I heav’d to head!—the good Posthumus
==158==(What should I say? He was too good to be
==159==Where ill men were, and was the best of all
==160==Amongst the rar’st of good ones), sitting sadly,
==161==Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
==162==For beauty that made barren the swell’d boast
==163==Of him that best could speak; for feature, laming
==164==The shrine of Venus or straight-pight Minerva,
==165==Postures beyond brief nature; for condition,
==166==A shop of all the qualities that man
==167==Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
==168==Fairness which strikes the eye⁠—

**CYM.**
==168==                I stand on fire:
==169==Come to the matter.

**JACH.**
==169==           All too soon I shall,
==170==Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
==171==Most like a noble lord in love and one
==172==That had a royal lover, took his hint,
==173==And (not dispraising whom we prais’d; therein
==174==He was as calm as virtue) he began
==175==His mistress’ picture, which by his tongue being made,
==176==And then a mind put in’t, either our brags
==177==Were crak’d of kitchen trulls, or his description
==178==Prov’d us unspeaking sots.

**CYM.**
==178==              Nay, nay, to th’ purpose.

**JACH.**
==179==Your daughter’s chastity—there it begins.
==180==He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
==181==And she alone were cold; whereat I, wretch,
==182==Made scruple of his praise, and wager’d with him
==183==Pieces of gold ’gainst this which then he wore
==184==Upon his honor’d finger, to attain
==185==In suit the place of ’s bed and win this ring
==186==By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
==187==No lesser of her honor confident
==188==Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring,
==189==And would so, had it been a carbuncle
==190==Of Phoebus’ wheel; and might so safely, had it
==191==Been all the worth of ’s car. Away to Britain
==192==Post I in this design. Well may you, sir,
==193==Remember me at court, where I was taught
==194==Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
==195==’Twixt amorous and villainous. Being thus quench’d
==196==Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
==197==Gan in your duller Britain operate
==198==Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent;
==199==And to be brief, my practice so prevail’d,
==200==That I return’d with simular proof enough
==201==To make the noble Leonatus mad,
==202==By wounding his belief in her renown
==203==With tokens thus, and thus; averring notes
==204==Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet
==205==(O cunning, how I got’t!), nay, some marks
==206==Of secret on her person, that he could not
==207==But think her bond of chastity quite crack’d,
==208==I having ta’en the forfeit. Whereupon⁠—
==209==Methinks I see him now⁠—

**POST.**
*(Advancing.)*
==209==              Ay, so thou dost,
==210==Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
==211==Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
==212==That’s due to all the villains past, in being,
==213==To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
==214==Some upright justicer! Thou, King, send out
==215==For torturers ingenious; it is I
==216==That all th’ abhorred things o’ th’ earth amend
==217==By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
==218==That kill’d thy daughter—villain-like, I lie⁠—
==219==That caus’d a lesser villain than myself,
==220==A sacrilegious thief, to do’t. The temple
==221==Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
==222==Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
==223==The dogs o’ th’ street to bay me; every villain
==224==Be call’d Posthumus Leonatus, and
==225==Be villainy less than ’twas! O Imogen!
==226==My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
==227==Imogen, Imogen!

**IMO.**
==227==           Peace, my lord, hear, hear⁠—

**POST.**
==228==Shall ’s have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
==229==There lie thy part.

*Striking her; she falls.*

**PIS.**
==229==           O gentlemen, help
==230==Mine and your mistress! O my Lord Posthumus,
==231==You ne’er kill’d Imogen till now! Help, help!
==232==Mine honor’d lady!

**CYM.**
==232==           Does the world go round?

**POST.**
==233==How comes these staggers on me?

**PIS.**
==233==                  Wake, my mistress!

**CYM.**
==234==If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
==235==To death with mortal joy.

**PIS.**
==235==              How fares my mistress?

**IMO.**
==236==O, get thee from my sight,
==237==Thou gav’st me poison. Dangerous fellow, hence!
==238==Breathe not where princes are.

**CYM.**
==238==                The tune of Imogen!

**PIS.**
==239==Lady,
==240==The gods throw stones of sulfur on me, if
==241==That box I gave you was not thought by me
==242==A precious thing. I had it from the Queen.

**CYM.**
==243==New matter still.

**IMO.**
==243==           It poison’d me.

**COR.**
==243==                       O gods!
==244==I left out one thing which the Queen confess’d,
==245==Which must approve thee honest. “If Pisanio
==246==Have,” said she, “given his mistress that confection
==247==Which I gave him for cordial, she is serv’d
==248==As I would serve a rat.”

**CYM.**
==248==              What’s this, Cornelius?

**COR.**
==249==The Queen, sir, very oft importun’d me
==250==To temper poisons for her, still pretending
==251==The satisfaction of her knowledge only
==252==In killing creatures vild, as cats and dogs
==253==Of no esteem. I, dreading that her purpose
==254==Was of more danger, did compound for her
==255==A certain stuff, which, being ta’en, would cease
==256==The present pow’r of life, but in short time
==257==All offices of nature should again
==258==Do their due functions. Have you ta’en of it?

**IMO.**
==259==Most like I did, for I was dead.

**BEL.**
==259==                  My boys,
==260==There was our error.

**GUI.**
==260==           This is sure Fidele.

**IMO.**
==261==Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
==262==Think that you are upon a rock, and now
==263==Throw me again.

*Embracing him.*

**POST.**
==263==           Hang there like fruit, my soul,
==264==Till the tree die!

**CYM.**
==264==           How now, my flesh? My child?
==265==What, mak’st thou me a dullard in this act?
==266==Wilt thou not speak to me?

**IMO.**
*(Kneeling.)*
==266==              Your blessing, sir.

**BEL.**
*(To Guiderius and Arviragus.)*
==267==Though you did love this youth, I blame ye not,
==268==You had a motive for’t.

**CYM.**
==268==              My tears that fall
==269==Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
==270==Thy mother’s dead.

**IMO.**
==270==           I am sorry for’t, my lord.

**CYM.**
==271==O, she was naught; and long of her it was
==272==That we meet here so strangely; but her son
==273==Is gone, we know not how, nor where.

**PIS.**
==273==                     My lord,
==274==Now fear is from me, I’ll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
==275==Upon my lady’s missing, came to me
==276==With his sword drawn, foam’d at the mouth, and swore,
==277==If I discover’d not which way she was gone,
==278==It was my instant death. By accident
==279==I had a feigned letter of my master’s
==280==Then in my pocket, which directed him
==281==To seek her on the mountains near to Milford,
==282==Where, in a frenzy, in my master’s garments
==283==(Which he enforc’d from me), away he posts
==284==With unchaste purpose, and with oath to violate
==285==My lady’s honor. What became of him
==286==I further know not.

**GUI.**
==286==           Let me end the story:
==287==I slew him there.

**CYM.**
==287==           Marry, the gods forfend!
==288==I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
==289==Pluck a hard sentence. Prithee, valiant youth,
==290==Deny’t again.

**GUI.**
==290==        I have spoke it, and I did it.

**CYM.**
==291==He was a prince.

**GUI.**
==292==A most incivil one. The wrongs he did me
==293==Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
==294==With language that would make me spurn the sea
==295==If it could so roar to me. I cut off ’s head,
==296==And am right glad he is not standing here
==297==To tell this tale of mine.

**CYM.**
==297==              I am sorrow for thee;
==298==By thine own tongue thou art condemn’d, and must
==299==Endure our law. Thou’rt dead.

**IMO.**
==299==                That headless man
==300==I thought had been my lord.

**CYM.**
==300==                Bind the offender,
==301==And take him from our presence.

**BEL.**
==301==                  Stay, sir King.
==302==This man is better than the man he slew,
==303==As well descended as thyself, and hath
==304==More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
==305==Had ever scar for.
*(To the Guard.)*
==305==           Let his arms alone,
==306==They were not born for bondage.

**CYM.**
==306==                  Why, old soldier:
==307==Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
==308==By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
==309==As good as we?

**ARV.**
==309==        In that he spake too far.

**CYM.**
==310==And thou shalt die for’t.

**BEL.**
==310==              We will die all three
==311==But I will prove that two on ’s are as good
==312==As I have given out him. My sons, I must
==313==For mine own part unfold a dangerous speech,
==314==Though haply well for you.

**ARV.**
==314==              Your danger’s ours.

**GUI.**
==315==And our good his.

**BEL.**
==315==           Have at it then, by leave:
==316==Thou hadst, great King, a subject who
==317==Was call’d Belarius.

**CYM.**
==317==           What of him? He is
==318==A banish’d traitor.

**BEL.**
==318==           He it is that hath
==319==Assum’d this age: indeed a banish’d man,
==320==I know not how a traitor.

**CYM.**
==320==              Take him hence,
==321==The whole world shall not save him.

**BEL.**
==321==                  Not too hot.
==322==First pay me for the nursing of thy sons,
==323==And let it be confiscate all, so soon
==324==As I have receiv’d it.

**CYM.**
==324==           Nursing of my sons?

**BEL.**
==325==I am too blunt and saucy: here’s my knee.
==326==Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
==327==Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
==328==These two young gentlemen, that call me father,
==329==And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
==330==They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
==331==And blood of your begetting.

**CYM.**
==331==                How? My issue?

**BEL.**
==332==So sure as you your father’s. I, old Morgan,
==333==Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish’d.
==334==Your pleasure was my mere offense, my punishment
==335==Itself, and all my treason: that I suffer’d
==336==Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes
==337==(For such and so they are) these twenty years
==338==Have I train’d up; those arts they have as I
==339==Could put into them. My breeding was, sir, as
==340==Your Highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile
==341==(Whom for the theft I wedded), stole these children
==342==Upon my banishment; I mov’d her to’t,
==343==Having receiv’d the punishment before
==344==For that which I did then. Beaten for loyalty
==345==Excited me to treason. Their dear loss,
==346==The more of you ’twas felt, the more it shap’d
==347==Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
==348==Here are your sons again, and I must lose
==349==Two of the sweet’st companions in the world.
==350==The benediction of these covering heavens
==351==Fall on their heads like dew! For they are worthy
==352==To inlay heaven with stars.

**CYM.**
==352==              Thou weep’st, and speak’st.
==353==The service that you three have done is more
==354==Unlike than this thou tell’st. I lost my children;
==355==If these be they, I know not how to wish
==356==A pair of worthier sons.

**BEL.**
==356==              Be pleas’d awhile:
==357==This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
==358==Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius;
==359==This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
==360==Your younger princely son. He, sir, was lapp’d
==361==In a most curious mantle, wrought by th’ hand
==362==Of his queen mother, which for more probation
==363==I can with ease produce.

**CYM.**
==363==              Guiderius had
==364==Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star,
==365==It was a mark of wonder.

**BEL.**
==365==              This is he,
==366==Who hath upon him still that natural stamp.
==367==It was wise nature’s end in the donation,
==368==To be his evidence now.

**CYM.**
==368==              O, what, am I
==369==A mother to the birth of three? Ne’er mother
==370==Rejoic’d deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
==371==That after this strange starting from your orbs,
==372==You may reign in them now! O Imogen,
==373==Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

**IMO.**
==373==                  No, my lord;
==374==I have got two worlds by’t. O my gentle brothers,
==375==Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
==376==But I am truest speaker. You call’d me brother,
==377==When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
==378==When we were so indeed.

**CYM.**
==378==              Did you e’er meet?

**ARV.**
==379==Ay, my good lord.

**GUI.**
==379==           And at first meeting lov’d,
==380==Continu’d so, until we thought he died.

**COR.**
==381==By the Queen’s dram she swallow’d.

**CYM.**
==381==                     O rare instinct!
==382==When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgment
==383==Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
==384==Distinction should be rich in. Where? How liv’d you?
==385==And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
==386==How parted with your brothers? How first met them?
==387==Why fled you from the court? And whither? These,
==388==And your three motives to the battle, with
==389==I know not how much more, should be demanded,
==390==And all the other by-dependances,
==391==From chance to chance; but nor the time nor place
==392==Will serve our long interrogatories. See,
==393==Posthumus anchors upon Imogen;
==394==And she (like harmless lightning) throws her eye
==395==On him, her brothers, me, her master, hitting
==396==Each object with a joy; the counterchange
==397==Is severally in all. Let’s quit this ground,
==398==And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
*(To Belarius.)*
==399==Thou art my brother, so we’ll hold thee ever.

**IMO.**
==400==You are my father too, and did relieve me
==401==To see this gracious season.

**CYM.**
==401==                All o’erjoy’d,
==402==Save these in bonds. Let them be joyful too,
==403==For they shall taste our comfort.

**IMO.**
==403==                  My good master,
==404==I will yet do you service.

**LUC.**
==404==              Happy be you!

**CYM.**
==405==The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
==406==He would have well becom’d this place, and grac’d
==407==The thankings of a king.

**POST.**
==407==              I am, sir,
==408==The soldier that did company these three
==409==In poor beseeming; ’twas a fitment for
==410==The purpose I then follow’d. That I was he,
==411==Speak, Jachimo. I had you down and might
==412==Have made you finish.

**JACH.**
*(Kneeling.)*
==412==              I am down again;
==413==But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
==414==As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
==415==Which I so often owe; but your ring first,
==416==And here the bracelet of the truest princess
==417==That ever swore her faith.

**POST.**
==417==              Kneel not to me.
==418==The pow’r that I have on you is to spare you;
==419==The malice towards you, to forgive you. Live,
==420==And deal with others better.

**CYM.**
==420==              Nobly doom’d!
==421==We’ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law:
==422==Pardon’s the word to all.

**ARV.**
*(To Posthumus.)*
==422==              You help us, sir,
==423==As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
==424==Joy’d are we that you are.

**POST.**
==425==Your servant, Princes. Good my lord of Rome,
==426==Call forth your soothsayer. As I slept, methought
==427==Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back’d,
==428==Appear’d to me, with other spritely shows
==429==Of mine own kindred. When I wak’d, I found
==430==This label on my bosom, whose containing
==431==Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
==432==Make no collection of it. Let him show
==433==His skill in the construction.

**LUC.**
==433==                Philarmonus!

**PHIL.**
==434==Here, my good lord.

**LUC.**
==434==           Read, and declare the meaning.

**PHIL.**
*(Reads.)*
==435==*“When as a lion’s whelp shall, to himself unknown, without seeking find, and be embrac’d by a piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be lopp’d branches, which, being dead many years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.”*
==436==Thou, Leonatus, art the lion’s whelp;
==437==The fit and apt construction of thy name,
==438==Being Leo-natus, doth import so much.
*(To Cymbeline)*
==439==The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
==440==Which we call *mollis aer*, and *mollis aer*
==441==We term it *mulier*;
*(To Posthumus)*
==441==           which mulier I divine
==442==Is this most constant wife, who, even now,
==443==Answering the letter of the oracle,
==444==Unknown to you, unsought, were clipt about
==445==With this most tender air.

**CYM.**
==445==              This hath some seeming.

**PHIL.**
==446==The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
==447==Personates thee; and thy lopp’d branches point
==448==Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol’n,
==449==For many years thought dead, are now reviv’d,
==450==To the majestic cedar join’d, whose issue
==451==Promises Britain peace and plenty.

**CYM.**
==451==                  Well,
==452==My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
==453==Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
==454==And to the Roman empire, promising
==455==To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
==456==We were dissuaded by our wicked queen,
==457==Whom heavens, in justice both on her and hers,
==458==Have laid most heavy hand.

**PHIL.**
==459==The fingers of the pow’rs above do tune
==460==The harmony of this peace. The vision
==461==Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
==462==Of yet this scarce-cold battle, at this instant
==463==Is full accomplish’d: for the Roman eagle,
==464==From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
==465==Lessen’d herself, and in the beams o’ th’ sun
==466==So vanish’d; which foreshow’d our princely eagle,
==467==Th’ imperial Caesar, should again unite
==468==His favor with the radiant Cymbeline,
==469==Which shines here in the west.

**CYM.**
==469==                Laud we the gods,
==470==And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
==471==From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
==472==To all our subjects. Set we forward. Let
==473==A Roman and a British ensign wave
==474==Friendly together. So through Lud’s-Town march,
==475==And in the temple of great Jupiter
==476==Our peace we’ll ratify; seal it with feasts.
==477==Set on there! Never was a war did cease
==478==(Ere bloody hands were wash’d) with such a peace.

*Exeunt.*
