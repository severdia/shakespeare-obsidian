## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Britain. A public place.*

*Enter Cloten and two Lords.*

**1. LORD.**
==1== Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there’s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

**CLO.**
==2== If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==3== No, faith; not so much as his patience.

**1. LORD.**
==4== Hurt him? His body’s a passable carcass, if he be not hurt; it is a throughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==5== His steel was in debt, it went o’ th’ backside the town.

**CLO.**
==6== The villain would not stand me.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==7== No, but he fled forward still, toward your face.

**1. LORD.**
==8== Stand you? You have land enough of your own, but he added to your having, gave you some ground.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==9== As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!

**CLO.**
==10== I would they had not come between us.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==11== So would I, till you had measur’d how long a fool you were upon the ground.

**CLO.**
==12== And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==13== If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn’d.

**1. LORD.**
==14== Sir, as I told you always; her beauty and her brain go not together. She’s a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==15== She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.

**CLO.**
==16== Come, I’ll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
==17== I wish not so, unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.

**CLO.**
==18== You’ll go with us?

**1. LORD.**
==19== I’ll attend your lordship.

**CLO.**
==20== Nay, come, let’s go together.

**2. LORD.**
==21== Well, my lord.

*Exeunt.*
