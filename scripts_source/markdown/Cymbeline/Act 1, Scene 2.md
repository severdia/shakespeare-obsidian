## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Britain. A public place.*

*Enter Cloten and two Lords.*

**1. LORD.**
Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice. Where air comes out, air comes in; there’s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

**CLO.**
If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
No, faith; not so much as his patience.

**1. LORD.**
Hurt him? His body’s a passable carcass, if he be not hurt; it is a throughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
His steel was in debt, it went o’ th’ backside the town.

**CLO.**
The villain would not stand me.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
No, but he fled forward still, toward your face.

**1. LORD.**
Stand you? You have land enough of your own, but he added to your having, gave you some ground.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!

**CLO.**
I would they had not come between us.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
So would I, till you had measur’d how long a fool you were upon the ground.

**CLO.**
And that she should love this fellow, and refuse me!

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
If it be a sin to make a true election, she is damn’d.

**1. LORD.**
Sir, as I told you always; her beauty and her brain go not together. She’s a good sign, but I have seen small reflection of her wit.

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
She shines not upon fools, lest the reflection should hurt her.

**CLO.**
Come, I’ll to my chamber. Would there had been some hurt done!

**2. LORD.**
*(Aside.)*
I wish not so, unless it had been the fall of an ass, which is no great hurt.

**CLO.**
You’ll go with us?

**1. LORD.**
I’ll attend your lordship.

**CLO.**
Nay, come, let’s go together.

**2. LORD.**
Well, my lord.

*Exeunt.*
