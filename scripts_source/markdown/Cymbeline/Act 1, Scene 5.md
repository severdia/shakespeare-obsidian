## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 1, Scene 6|Act 1, Scene 6 →]]

*Britain. A room in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Queen, Ladies, and Cornelius.*

**QUEEN.**
Whiles yet the dew’s on ground, gather those flowers;
Make haste. Who has the note of them?

**LADY**
                       I, madam.

**QUEEN.**
Dispatch.
*(Exeunt Ladies.)*
Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

**COR.**
Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.
*(Presenting a small box.)*
But I beseech your Grace, without offense
(My conscience bids me ask), wherefore you have
Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,
Which are the movers of a languishing death,
But though slow, deadly.

**QUEEN.**
              I wonder, doctor,
Thou ask’st me such a question. Have I not been
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn’d me how
To make perfumes? Distill? Preserve? Yea so,
That our great King himself doth woo me oft
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded
(Unless thou think’st me devilish) is’t not meet
That I did amplify my judgment in
Other conclusions? I will try the forces
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
We count not worth the hanging (but none human),
To try the vigor of them, and apply
Allayments to their act, and by them gather
Their several virtues and effects.

**COR.**
                  Your Highness
Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;
Besides, the seeing these effects will be
Both noisome and infectious.

**QUEEN.**
                O, content thee.
*(Enter Pisanio.)*
*(Aside.)*
Here comes a flattering rascal, upon him
Will I first work. He’s for his master,
And enemy to my son.—How now, Pisanio?
Doctor, your service for this time is ended,
Take your own way.

**COR.**
*(Aside.)*
           I do suspect you, madam,
But you shall do no harm.

**QUEEN.**
*(To Pisanio.)*
              Hark thee, a word.

**COR.**
*(Aside.)*
I do not like her. She doth think she has
Strange ling’ring poisons. I do know her spirit,
And will not trust one of her malice with
A drug of such damn’d nature. Those she has
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,
Which first (perchance) she’ll prove on cats and dogs,
Then afterward up higher; but there is
No danger in what show of death it makes,
More than the locking up the spirits a time,
To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool’d
With a most false effect; and I the truer,
So to be false with her.

**QUEEN.**
           No further service, doctor,
Until I send for thee.

**COR.**
           I humbly take my leave.

*Exit.*

**QUEEN.**
Weeps she still, say’st thou? Dost thou think in time
She will not quench, and let instructions enter
Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
I’ll tell thee on the instant thou art then
As great as is thy master—greater, for
His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
Continue where he is. To shift his being
Is to exchange one misery with another,
And every day that comes comes to decay
A day’s work in him. What shalt thou expect
To be depender on a thing that leans?
Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
So much as but to prop him?
*(The Queen drops the box; Pisanio takes it up.)*
                Thou tak’st up
Thou know’st not what; but take it for thy labor.
It is a thing I made, which hath the King
Five times redeem’d from death. I do not know
What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it,
It is an earnest of a farther good
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
The case stands with her; do’t as from thyself.
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,
Who shall take notice of thee. I’ll move the King
To any shape of thy preferment, such
As thou’lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
That set thee on to this desert, am bound
To load thy merit richly. Call my women.
Think on my words.
*(Exit Pisanio.)*
           A sly and constant knave,
Not to be shak’d; the agent for his master,
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
Of liegers for her sweet; and which she after,
Except she bend her humor, shall be assur’d
To taste of too.
*(Enter Pisanio and Ladies.)*
        So, so. Well done, well done.
The violets, cowslips, and the primeroses,
Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
Think on my words.

*Exeunt Queen and Ladies.*

**PIS.**
           And shall do.
But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
I’ll choke myself. There’s all I’ll do for you.

*Exit.*
