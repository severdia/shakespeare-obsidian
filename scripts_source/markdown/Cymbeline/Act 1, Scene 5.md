## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 1, Scene 6|Act 1, Scene 6 →]]

*Britain. A room in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Queen, Ladies, and Cornelius.*

**QUEEN.**
==1==Whiles yet the dew’s on ground, gather those flowers;
==2==Make haste. Who has the note of them?

**LADY**
==2==                       I, madam.

**QUEEN.**
==3==Dispatch.
*(Exeunt Ladies.)*
==4==Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

**COR.**
==5==Pleaseth your Highness, ay. Here they are, madam.
*(Presenting a small box.)*
==6==But I beseech your Grace, without offense
==7==(My conscience bids me ask), wherefore you have
==8==Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,
==9==Which are the movers of a languishing death,
==10==But though slow, deadly.

**QUEEN.**
==10==              I wonder, doctor,
==11==Thou ask’st me such a question. Have I not been
==12==Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn’d me how
==13==To make perfumes? Distill? Preserve? Yea so,
==14==That our great King himself doth woo me oft
==15==For my confections? Having thus far proceeded
==16==(Unless thou think’st me devilish) is’t not meet
==17==That I did amplify my judgment in
==18==Other conclusions? I will try the forces
==19==Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
==20==We count not worth the hanging (but none human),
==21==To try the vigor of them, and apply
==22==Allayments to their act, and by them gather
==23==Their several virtues and effects.

**COR.**
==23==                  Your Highness
==24==Shall from this practice but make hard your heart;
==25==Besides, the seeing these effects will be
==26==Both noisome and infectious.

**QUEEN.**
==26==                O, content thee.
*(Enter Pisanio.)*
*(Aside.)*
==27==Here comes a flattering rascal, upon him
==28==Will I first work. He’s for his master,
==29==And enemy to my son.—How now, Pisanio?
==30==Doctor, your service for this time is ended,
==31==Take your own way.

**COR.**
*(Aside.)*
==31==           I do suspect you, madam,
==32==But you shall do no harm.

**QUEEN.**
*(To Pisanio.)*
==32==              Hark thee, a word.

**COR.**
*(Aside.)*
==33==I do not like her. She doth think she has
==34==Strange ling’ring poisons. I do know her spirit,
==35==And will not trust one of her malice with
==36==A drug of such damn’d nature. Those she has
==37==Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile,
==38==Which first (perchance) she’ll prove on cats and dogs,
==39==Then afterward up higher; but there is
==40==No danger in what show of death it makes,
==41==More than the locking up the spirits a time,
==42==To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool’d
==43==With a most false effect; and I the truer,
==44==So to be false with her.

**QUEEN.**
==44==           No further service, doctor,
==45==Until I send for thee.

**COR.**
==45==           I humbly take my leave.

*Exit.*

**QUEEN.**
==46==Weeps she still, say’st thou? Dost thou think in time
==47==She will not quench, and let instructions enter
==48==Where folly now possesses? Do thou work.
==49==When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
==50==I’ll tell thee on the instant thou art then
==51==As great as is thy master—greater, for
==52==His fortunes all lie speechless, and his name
==53==Is at last gasp. Return he cannot, nor
==54==Continue where he is. To shift his being
==55==Is to exchange one misery with another,
==56==And every day that comes comes to decay
==57==A day’s work in him. What shalt thou expect
==58==To be depender on a thing that leans?
==59==Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends
==60==So much as but to prop him?
*(The Queen drops the box; Pisanio takes it up.)*
==60==                Thou tak’st up
==61==Thou know’st not what; but take it for thy labor.
==62==It is a thing I made, which hath the King
==63==Five times redeem’d from death. I do not know
==64==What is more cordial. Nay, I prithee take it,
==65==It is an earnest of a farther good
==66==That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
==67==The case stands with her; do’t as from thyself.
==68==Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
==69==Thou hast thy mistress still; to boot, my son,
==70==Who shall take notice of thee. I’ll move the King
==71==To any shape of thy preferment, such
==72==As thou’lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
==73==That set thee on to this desert, am bound
==74==To load thy merit richly. Call my women.
==75==Think on my words.
*(Exit Pisanio.)*
==75==           A sly and constant knave,
==76==Not to be shak’d; the agent for his master,
==77==And the remembrancer of her to hold
==78==The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
==79==Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
==80==Of liegers for her sweet; and which she after,
==81==Except she bend her humor, shall be assur’d
==82==To taste of too.
*(Enter Pisanio and Ladies.)*
==82==        So, so. Well done, well done.
==83==The violets, cowslips, and the primeroses,
==84==Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
==85==Think on my words.

*Exeunt Queen and Ladies.*

**PIS.**
==85==           And shall do.
==86==But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
==87==I’ll choke myself. There’s all I’ll do for you.

*Exit.*
