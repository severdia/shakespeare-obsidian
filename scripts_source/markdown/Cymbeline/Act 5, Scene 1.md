## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Britain. The Roman camp.*

*Enter Posthumus alone with a bloody handkerchief.*

**POST.**
==1== Yea, bloody cloth, I’ll keep thee, for I wish’d
==2== Thou shouldst be color’d thus. You married ones,
==3== If each of you should take this course, how many
==4== Must murder wives much better than themselves
==5== For wrying but a little! O Pisanio,
==6== Every good servant does not all commands;
==7== No bond, but to do just ones. Gods, if you
==8== Should have ta’en vengeance on my faults, I never
==9== Had liv’d to put on this; so had you saved
==10== The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
==11== Me, wretch, more worth your vengeance. But alack,
==12== You snatch some hence for little faults; that’s love,
==13== To have them fall no more: you some permit
==14== To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
==15== And make them dread it, to the doers’ thrift.
==16== But Imogen is your own, do your best wills,
==17== And make me blest to obey. I am brought hither
==18== Among th’ Italian gentry, and to fight
==19== Against my lady’s kingdom. ’Tis enough
==20== That, Britain, I have kill’d thy mistress; peace,
==21== I’ll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
==22== Hear patiently my purpose: I’ll disrobe me
==23== Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
==24== As does a Britain peasant; so I’ll fight
==25== Against the part I come with; so I’ll die
==26== For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
==27== Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
==28== Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
==29== Myself I’ll dedicate. Let me make men know
==30== More valor in me than my habits show.
==31== Gods, put the strength o’ th’ Leonati in me!
==32== To shame the guise o’ th’ world, I will begin
==33== The fashion: less without and more within.

*Exit.*
