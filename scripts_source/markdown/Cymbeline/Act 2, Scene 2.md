## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Britain. Imogen’s bedchamber in Cymbeline’s palace.*

*Enter Imogen in her bed, and a Lady. A trunk in one corner.*

**IMO.**
==1== Who’s there? My woman? Helen?

**HEL.**
==1==                   Please you, madam.

**IMO.**
==2== What hour is it?

**HEL.**
==2==         Almost midnight, madam.

**IMO.**
==3== I have read three hours then. Mine eyes are weak.
==4== Fold down the leaf where I have left. To bed.
==5== Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
==6== And if thou canst awake by four o’ th’ clock,
==7== I prithee call me. Sleep hath seiz’d me wholly.
*(Exit Helen.)*
==8== To your protection I commend me, gods,
==9== From fairies and the tempters of the night
==10== Guard me, beseech ye.

*Imogen sleeps.*

*Jachimo from the trunk.*

**JACH.**
==11== The crickets sing, and man’s o’erlabor’d sense
==12== Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
==13== Did softly press the rushes ere he waken’d
==14== The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
==15== How bravely thou becom’st thy bed! Fresh lily,
==16== And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
==17== But kiss, one kiss! Rubies unparagon’d,
==18== How dearly they do’t! ’Tis her breathing that
==19== Perfumes the chamber thus. The flame o’ th’ taper
==20== Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
==21== To see th’ enclosed lights, now canopied
==22== Under these windows, white and azure lac’d
==23== With blue of heaven’s own tinct. But my design!
==24== To note the chamber, I will write all down:
*(Takes out his tables.)*
==25== Such and such pictures; there the window; such
==26== Th’ adornment of her bed; the arras, figures,
==27== Why, such and such; and the contents o’ th’ story.
==28== Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
==29== Above ten thousand meaner moveables
==30== Would testify, t’ enrich mine inventory.
==31== O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her,
==32== And be her sense but as a monument,
==33== Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off;
*(Taking off her bracelet.)*
==34== As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
==35== ’Tis mine, and this will witness outwardly,
==36== As strongly as the conscience does within,
==37== To th’ madding of her lord. On her left breast
==38== A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
==39== I’ th’ bottom of a cowslip. Here’s a voucher,
==40== Stronger than ever law could make; this secret
==41== Will force him think I have pick’d the lock and ta’en
==42== The treasure of her honor. No more: to what end?
==43== Why should I write this down that’s riveted,
==44== Screw’d to my memory? She hath been reading late
==45== The tale of Tereus; here the leaf’s turn’d down
==46== Where Philomele gave up. I have enough;
==47== To th’ trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
==48== Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
==49== May bare the raven’s eye! I lodge in fear;
==50== Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
*(Clock strikes.)*
==51== One, two, three: time, time!

*Exit into the trunk.*
