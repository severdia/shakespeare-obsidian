## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Rome. Another room in Philario’s house.*

*Enter Posthumus.*

**POST.**
==1== Is there no way for men to be, but women
==2== Must be half-workers? We are all bastards,
==3== And that most venerable man which I
==4== Did call my father, was I know not where
==5== When I was stamp’d. Some coiner with his tools
==6== Made me a counterfeit; yet my mother seem’d
==7== The Dian of that time. So doth my wife
==8== The nonpareil of this. O vengeance, vengeance!
==9== Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain’d,
==10== And pray’d me oft forbearance; did it with
==11== A pudency so rosy the sweet view on’t
==12== Might well have warm’d old Saturn; that I thought her
==13== As chaste as unsunn’d snow. O, all the devils!
==14== This yellow Jachimo, in an hour—was’t not?⁠—
==15== Or less—at first? Perchance he spoke not, but
==16== Like a full-acorn’d boar, a German one,
==17== Cried “O!” and mounted; found no opposition
==18== But what he look’d for should oppose and she
==19== Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
==20== The woman’s part in me—for there’s no motion
==21== That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
==22== It is the woman’s part: be it lying, note it,
==23== The woman’s; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
==24== Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
==25== Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
==26== Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
==27== All faults that name, nay, that hell knows,
==28== Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;
==29== For even to vice
==30== They are not constant, but are changing still:
==31== One vice but of a minute old, for one
==32== Not half so old as that. I’ll write against them,
==33== Detest them, curse them; yet ’tis greater skill
==34== In a true hate, to pray they have their will:
==35== The very devils cannot plague them better.

*Exit.*
