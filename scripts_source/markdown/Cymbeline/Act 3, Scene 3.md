## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Wales. A mountainous country with a cave.*

*Enter from their cave Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus.*

**BEL.**
==1==A goodly day not to keep house with such
==2==Whose roof’s as low as ours! Stoop, boys, this gate
==3==Instructs you how t’ adore the heavens, and bows you
==4==To a morning’s holy office. The gates of monarchs
==5==Are arch’d so high that giants may jet through
==6==And keep their impious turbands on without
==7==Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
==8==We house i’ th’ rock, yet use thee not so hardly
==9==As prouder livers do.

**GUI.**
==9==           Hail, heaven!

**ARV.**
==9==                  Hail, heaven!

**BEL.**
==10==Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill,
==11==Your legs are young; I’ll tread these flats. Consider,
==12==When you above perceive me like a crow,
==13==That it is place which lessens and sets off,
==14==And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
==15==Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war.
==16==This service is not service, so being done,
==17==But being so allowed. To apprehend thus
==18==Draws us a profit from all things we see;
==19==And often, to our comfort, shall we find
==20==The sharded beetle in a safer hold
==21==Than is the full-wing’d eagle. O, this life
==22==Is nobler than attending for a check;
==23==Richer than doing nothing for a bable;
==24==Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
==25==Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine,
==26==Yet keeps his book uncross’d. No life to ours.

**GUI.**
==27==Out of your proof you speak; we poor unfledg’d
==28==Have never wing’d from view o’ th’ nest, nor know not
==29==What air’s from home. Happ’ly this life is best,
==30==If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
==31==That have a sharper known; well corresponding
==32==With your stiff age; but unto us it is
==33==A cell of ignorance, traveling a-bed,
==34==A prison, or a debtor that not dares
==35==To stride a limit.

**ARV.**
==35==        What should we speak of
==36==When we are old as you? When we shall hear
==37==The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
==38==In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
==39==The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing.
==40==We are beastly: subtle as the fox for prey,
==41==Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
==42==Our valor is to chase what flies. Our cage
==43==We make a choir, as doth the prison’d bird,
==44==And sing our bondage freely.

**BEL.**
==44==                How you speak!
==45==Did you but know the city’s usuries,
==46==And felt them knowingly; the art o’ th’ court,
==47==As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
==48==Is certain falling, or so slipp’ry that
==49==The fear’s as bad as falling; the toil o’ th’ war,
==50==A pain that only seems to seek out danger
==51==I’ th’ name of fame and honor which dies i’ th’ search,
==52==And hath as oft a sland’rous epitaph
==53==As record of fair act; nay, many times
==54==Doth ill deserve by doing well; what’s worse,
==55==Must curtsy at the censure. O boys, this story
==56==The world may read in me: my body’s mark’d
==57==With Roman swords, and my report was once
==58==First with the best of note. Cymbeline lov’d me,
==59==And when a soldier was the theme, my name
==60==Was not far off. Then was I as a tree
==61==Whose boughs did bend with fruit; but in one night,
==62==A storm or robbery (call it what you will) 
==63==Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
==64==And left me bare to weather.

**GUI.**
==64==                Uncertain favor!

**BEL.**
==65==My fault being nothing (as I have told you oft) 
==66==But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail’d
==67==Before my perfect honor, swore to Cymbeline
==68==I was confederate with the Romans. So
==69==Followed my banishment, and this twenty years
==70==This rock and these demesnes have been my world,
==71==Where I have liv’d at honest freedom, paid
==72==More pious debts to heaven than in all
==73==The fore-end of my time. But up to th’ mountains!
==74==This is not hunters’ language. He that strikes
==75==The venison first shall be the lord o’ th’ feast,
==76==To him the other two shall minister,
==77==And we will fear no poison, which attends
==78==In place of greater state. I’ll meet you in the valleys.
*(Exeunt Guiderius and Arviragus.)*
==79==How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
==80==These boys know little they are sons to th’ King,
==81==Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
==82==They think they are mine, and though train’d up thus meanly
==83==I’ th’ cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
==84==The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
==85==In simple and low things to prince it much
==86==Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
==87==The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
==88==The King his father call’d Guiderius—Jove!
==89==When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
==90==The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
==91==Into my story; say, “Thus mine enemy fell,
==92==And thus I set my foot on ’s neck,” even then
==93==The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
==94==Strains his young nerves, and puts himself in posture
==95==That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
==96==Once Arviragus, in as like a figure
==97==Strikes life into my speech, and shows much more
==98==His own conceiving.—Hark, the game is rous’d!⁠—
==99==O Cymbeline, heaven and my conscience knows
==100==Thou didst unjustly banish me; whereon,
==101==At three and two years old, I stole these babes,
==102==Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
==103==Thou refts me of my lands. Euriphile,
==104==Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for their mother,
==105==And every day do honor to her grave.
==106==Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call’d,
==107==They take for natural father.—The game is up.

*Exit.*
