## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*The frontiers of Mantua. A forest between Milan and Verona.*

*Enter Valentine, Speed, and certain Outlaws.*

**1. OUT.**
==1==Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.

**2. OUT.**
==2==If there be ten, shrink not, but down with ’em.

**3. OUT.**
==3==Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye.
==4==If not, we’ll make you sit, and rifle you.

**SPEED.**
==5==Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
==6==That all the travelers do fear so much.

**VAL.**
==7==My friends⁠—

**1. OUT.**
==8==That’s not so, sir; we are your enemies.

**2. OUT.**
==9==Peace! We’ll hear him.

**3. OUT.**
==10==Ay, by my beard, will we, for he is a proper man.

**VAL.**
==11==Then know that I have little wealth to lose.
==12==A man I am cross’d with adversity;
==13==My riches are these poor habiliments,
==14==Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
==15==You take the sum and substance that I have.

**2. OUT.**
==16==Whither travel you?

**VAL.**
==17==To Verona.

**1. OUT.**
==18==Whence came you?

**VAL.**
==19==From Milan.

**3. OUT.**
==20==Have you long sojourn’d there?

**VAL.**
==21==Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay’d,
==22==If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.

**1. OUT.**
==23==What, were you banish’d thence?

**VAL.**
==24==I was.

**2. OUT.**
==25==For what offense?

**VAL.**
==26==For that which now torments me to rehearse:
==27==I kill’d a man, whose death I much repent,
==28==But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
==29==Without false vantage, or base treachery.

**1. OUT.**
==30==Why, ne’er repent it, if it were done so.
==31==But were you banish’d for so small a fault?

**VAL.**
==32==I was, and held me glad of such a doom.

**2. OUT.**
==33==Have you the tongues?

**VAL.**
==34==My youthful travel therein made me happy,
==35==Or else I often had been miserable.

**3. OUT.**
==36==By the bare scalp of Robin Hood’s fat friar,
==37==This fellow were a king for our wild faction!

**1. OUT.**
==38==We’ll have him. Sirs, a word.

**SPEED.**
==38==              Master, be one of them;
==39==It’s an honorable kind of thievery.

**VAL.**
==39==                  Peace, villain.

**2. OUT.**
==40==Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?

**VAL.**
==41==Nothing but my fortune.

**3. OUT.**
==42==Know then, that some of us are gentlemen,
==43==Such as the fury of ungovern’d youth
==44==Thrust from the company of awful men.
==45==Myself was from Verona banished
==46==For practicing to steal away a lady,
==47==An heir, and near allied unto the Duke.

**2. OUT.**
==48==And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
==49==Who, in my mood, I stabb’d unto the heart.

**1. OUT.**
==50==And I for such like petty crimes as these.
==51==But to the purpose—for we cite our faults
==52==That they may hold excus’d our lawless lives;
==53==And partly, seeing you are beautified
==54==With goodly shape, and by your own report
==55==A linguist, and a man of such perfection
==56==As we do in our quality much want⁠—

**2. OUT.**
==57==Indeed because you are a banish’d man,
==58==Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
==59==Are you content to be our general?
==60==To make a virtue of necessity
==61==And live as we do in this wilderness?

**3. OUT.**
==62==What say’st thou? Wilt thou be of our consort?
==63==Say “ay” and be the captain of us all:
==64==We’ll do thee homage and be rul’d by thee,
==65==Love thee as our commander and our king.

**1. OUT.**
==66==But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.

**2. OUT.**
==67==Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer’d.

**VAL.**
==68==I take your offer, and will live with you,
==69==Provided that you do no outrages
==70==On silly women or poor passengers.

**3. OUT.**
==71==No, we detest such vile base practices.
==72==Come, go with us, we’ll bring thee to our crews,
==73==And show thee all the treasure we have got;
==74==Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.

*Exeunt.*
