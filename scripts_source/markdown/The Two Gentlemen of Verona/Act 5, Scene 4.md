## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]]

*The frontiers of Mantua. Another part of the forest between Milan and Verona.*

*Enter Valentine.*

**VAL.**
==1==How use doth breed a habit in a man!
==2==This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
==3==I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
==4==Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
==5==And to the nightingale’s complaining notes
==6==Tune my distresses and record my woes.
==7==O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
==8==Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
==9==Lest growing ruinous, the building fall
==10==And leave no memory of what it was!
==11==Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
==12==Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain.
*(Shouts within.)*
==13==What hallowing and what stir is this today?
==14==These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
==15==Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
==16==They love me well; yet I have much to do
==17==To keep them from uncivil outrages.
==18==Withdraw thee, Valentine: who’s this comes here?

*Steps aside.*

*Enter Proteus, Silvia, Julia disguised as Sebastian.*

**PRO.**
==19==Madam, this service I have done for you
==20==(Though you respect not aught your servant doth) 
==21==To hazard life, and rescue you from him
==22==That would have forc’d your honor and your love.
==23==Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look:
==24==A smaller boon than this I cannot beg,
==25==And less than this, I am sure you cannot give.

**VAL.**
*(Aside.)*
==26==How like a dream is this! I see, and hear:
==27==Love, lend me patience to forbear a while.

**SILV.**
==28==O miserable, unhappy that I am!

**PRO.**
==29==Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
==30==But by my coming I have made you happy.

**SILV.**
==31==By thy approach thou mak’st me most unhappy.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==32==And me, when he approacheth to your presence.

**SILV.**
==33==Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
==34==I would have been a breakfast to the beast
==35==Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
==36==O heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
==37==Whose life’s as tender to me as my soul!
==38==And full as much (for more there cannot be) 
==39==I do detest false perjur’d Proteus.
==40==Therefore be gone, solicit me no more.

**PRO.**
==41==What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
==42==Would I not undergo for one calm look?
==43==O, ’tis the curse in love, and still approv’d,
==44==When women cannot love where they’re belov’d!

**SILV.**
==45==When Proteus cannot love where he’s belov’d!
==46==Read over Julia’s heart (thy first best love),
==47==For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
==48==Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
==49==Descended into perjury, to love me.
==50==Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou’dst two,
==51==And that’s far worse than none: better have none
==52==Than plural faith, which is too much by one.
==53==Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!

**PRO.**
==53==                     In love
==54==Who respects friend?

**SILV.**
==54==           All men but Proteus.

**PRO.**
==55==Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
==56==Can no way change you to a milder form,
==57==I’ll woo you like a soldier, at arm’s end,
==58==And love you ’gainst the nature of love—force ye.

**SILV.**
==59==O heaven!

**PRO.**
==59==        I’ll force thee yield to my desire.

**VAL.**
*(Coming forward.)*
==60==Ruffian! Let go that rude uncivil touch,
==61==Thou friend of an ill fashion!

**PRO.**
==61==                Valentine!

**VAL.**
==62==Thou common friend, that’s without faith or love,
==63==For such is a friend now! Treacherous man,
==64==Thou hast beguil’d my hopes! Nought but mine eye
==65==Could have persuaded me; now I dare not say
==66==I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
==67==Who should be trusted, when one’s right hand
==68==Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
==69==I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
==70==But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
==71==The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst!
==72==’Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!

**PRO.**
==73==My shame and guilt confounds me.
==74==Forgive me, Valentine; if hearty sorrow
==75==Be a sufficient ransom for offense,
==76==I tender’t here: I do as truly suffer
==77==As e’er I did commit.

**VAL.**
==77==           Then I am paid;
==78==And once again I do receive thee honest.
==79==Who by repentance is not satisfied
==80==Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleas’d;
==81==By penitence th’ Eternal’s wrath’s appeas’d:
==82==And that my love may appear plain and free,
==83==All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.

**JUL.**
==84==O me unhappy!

*Swoons.*

**PRO.**
==85==Look to the boy.

**VAL.**
==86==Why, boy! Why, wag! How now? What’s the matter? Look up; speak.

**JUL.**
==87==O good sir, my master charg’d me to deliver a ring to Madam Silvia, which (out of my neglect) was never done.

**PRO.**
==88==Where is that ring, boy?

**JUL.**
==88==              Here ’tis; this is it.

*Shows a ring.*

**PRO.**
==89==How? Let me see.
==90==Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.

**JUL.**
==91==O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook;
==92==This is the ring you sent to Silvia.

*Shows another ring.*

**PRO.**
==93==But how cam’st thou by this ring? At my depart
==94==I gave this unto Julia.

**JUL.**
==95==And Julia herself did give it me,
==96==And Julia herself hath brought it hither.

**PRO.**
==97==How? Julia?

**JUL.**
==98==Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
==99==And entertain’d ’em deeply in her heart.
==100==How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root?
==101==O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
==102==Be thou asham’d that I have took upon me
==103==Such an immodest raiment—if shame live
==104==In a disguise of love!
==105==It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
==106==Women to change their shapes than men their minds.

**PRO.**
==107==Than men their minds? ’Tis true. O heaven, were man
==108==But constant, he were perfect; that one error
==109==Fills him with faults; makes him run through all th’ sins:
==110==Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
==111==What is in Silvia’s face, but I may spy
==112==More fresh in Julia’s with a constant eye?

**VAL.**
==113==Come, come, a hand from either.
==114==Let me be blest to make this happy close;
==115==’Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.

**PRO.**
==116==Bear witness, heaven, I have my wish forever.

**JUL.**
==117==And I mine.

*Enter Duke, Thurio, Outlaws.*

**ALL OUTLAWS**
==118==A prize, a prize, a prize!

**VAL.**
==119==Forbear, forbear, I say; it is my lord the Duke.
==120==Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac’d,
==121==Banished Valentine.

**DUKE.**
==121==           Sir Valentine!

**THU.**
==122==Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia’s mine.

**VAL.**
==123==Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
==124==Come not within the measure of my wrath.
==125==Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
==126==Milan shall not hold thee. Here she stands,
==127==Take but possession of her with a touch:
==128==I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.

**THU.**
==129==Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
==130==I hold him but a fool that will endanger
==131==His body for a girl that loves him not.
==132==I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.

**DUKE.**
==133==The more degenerate and base art thou
==134==To make such means for her as thou hast done,
==135==And leave her on such slight conditions.
==136==Now, by the honor of my ancestry,
==137==I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
==138==And think thee worthy of an empress’ love.
==139==Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
==140==Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
==141==Plead a new state in thy unrivall’d merit,
==142==To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
==143==Thou art a gentleman and well deriv’d,
==144==Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserv’d her.

**VAL.**
==145==I thank your Grace; the gift hath made me happy.
==146==I now beseech you (for your daughter’s sake) 
==147==To grant one boon that I shall ask of you.

**DUKE.**
==148==I grant it (for thine own) what e’er it be.

**VAL.**
==149==These banish’d men, that I have kept withal,
==150==Are men endu’d with worthy qualities.
==151==Forgive them what they have committed here,
==152==And let them be recall’d from their exile;
==153==They are reformed, civil, full of good,
==154==And fit for great employment, worthy lord.

**DUKE.**
==155==Thou hast prevail’d, I pardon them and thee;
==156==Dispose of them as thou know’st their deserts.
==157==Come, let us go, we will include all jars
==158==With triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.

**VAL.**
==159==And as we walk along, I dare be bold
==160==With our discourse to make your Grace to smile.
==161==What think you of this page, my lord?

**DUKE.**
==162==I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.

**VAL.**
==163==I warrant you, my lord—more grace than boy.

**DUKE.**
==164==What mean you by that saying?

**VAL.**
==165==Please you, I’ll tell you as we pass along,
==166==That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
==167==Come, Proteus, ’tis your penance but to hear
==168==The story of your loves discovered;
==169==That done, our day of marriage shall be yours,
==170==One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.

*Exeunt.*
