## Act 2, Scene 7
[[Act 2, Scene 6|← Act 2, Scene 6]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Verona. A room in Julia’s house.*

*Enter Julia and Lucetta.*

**JUL.**
==1==Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
==2==And ev’n in kind love I do conjure thee,
==3==Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
==4==Are visibly character’d and engrav’d,
==5==To lesson me and tell me some good mean
==6==How with my honor I may undertake
==7==A journey to my loving Proteus.

**LUC.**
==8==Alas, the way is wearisome and long.

**JUL.**
==9==A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
==10==To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
==11==Much less shall she that hath Love’s wings to fly,
==12==And when the flight is made to one so dear,
==13==Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.

**LUC.**
==14==Better forbear till Proteus make return.

**JUL.**
==15==O, know’st thou not his looks are my soul’s food?
==16==Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
==17==By longing for that food so long a time.
==18==Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
==19==Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
==20==As seek to quench the fire of love with words.

**LUC.**
==21==I do not seek to quench your love’s hot fire,
==22==But qualify the fire’s extreme rage,
==23==Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.

**JUL.**
==24==The more thou dam’st it up, the more it burns:
==25==The current that with gentle murmur glides,
==26==Thou know’st, being stopp’d, impatiently doth rage;
==27==But when his fair course is not hindered,
==28==He makes sweet music with th’ enamell’d stones,
==29==Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
==30==He overtaketh in his pilgrimage;
==31==And so by many winding nooks he strays
==32==With willing sport to the wild ocean.
==33==Then let me go, and hinder not my course:
==34==I’ll be as patient as a gentle stream,
==35==And make a pastime of each weary step,
==36==Till the last step have brought me to my love,
==37==And there I’ll rest, as after much turmoil
==38==A blessed soul doth in Elysium.

**LUC.**
==39==But in what habit will you go along?

**JUL.**
==40==Not like a woman, for I would prevent
==41==The loose encounters of lascivious men:
==42==Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
==43==As may beseem some well-reputed page.

**LUC.**
==44==Why then your ladyship must cut your hair.

**JUL.**
==45==No, girl, I’ll knit it up in silken strings,
==46==With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots:
==47==To be fantastic may become a youth
==48==Of greater time than I shall show to be.

**LUC.**
==49==What fashion, madam, shall I make your breeches?

**JUL.**
==50==That fits as well as “Tell me, good my lord,
==51==What compass will you wear your farthingale?”
==52==Why, ev’n what fashion thou best likes, Lucetta.

**LUC.**
==53==You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.

**JUL.**
==54==Out, out, Lucetta, that will be ill-favor’d.

**LUC.**
==55==A round hose, madam, now’s not worth a pin,
==56==Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.

**JUL.**
==57==Lucetta, as thou lov’st me, let me have
==58==What thou think’st meet, and is most mannerly.
==59==But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
==60==For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
==61==I fear me it will make me scandaliz’d.

**LUC.**
==62==If you think so, then stay at home and go not.

**JUL.**
==63==Nay, that I will not.

**LUC.**
==64==Then never dream on infamy, but go.
==65==If Proteus like your journey when you come,
==66==No matter who’s displeas’d when you are gone:
==67==I fear me he will scarce be pleas’d withal.

**JUL.**
==68==That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
==69==A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears,
==70==And instances of infinite of love,
==71==Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.

**LUC.**
==72==All these are servants to deceitful men.

**JUL.**
==73==Base men, that use them to so base effect!
==74==But truer stars did govern Proteus’ birth:
==75==His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
==76==His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
==77==His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
==78==His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.

**LUC.**
==79==Pray heav’n he prove so when you come to him!

**JUL.**
==80==Now, as thou lov’st me, do him not that wrong,
==81==To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
==82==Only deserve my love by loving him,
==83==And presently go with me to my chamber,
==84==To take a note of what I stand in need of,
==85==To furnish me upon my longing journey.
==86==All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
==87==My goods, my lands, my reputation;
==88==Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
==89==Come; answer not; but to it presently,
==90==I am impatient of my tarriance.

*Exeunt.*
