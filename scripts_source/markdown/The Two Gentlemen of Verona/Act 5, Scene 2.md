## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Milan. A room in the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Thurio, Proteus, Julia disguised as Sebastian.*

**THU.**
==1==Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?

**PRO.**
==2==O, sir, I find her milder than she was,
==3==And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

**THU.**
==4==What? That my leg is too long?

**PRO.**
==5==No, that it is too little.

**THU.**
==6==I’ll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==7==But love will not be spurr’d to what it loathes.

**THU.**
==8==What says she to my face?

**PRO.**
==9==She says it is a fair one.

**THU.**
==10==Nay then the wanton lies; my face is black.

**PRO.**
==11==But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
==12==Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies’ eyes.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==13==’Tis true, such pearls as put out ladies’ eyes,
==14==For I had rather wink than look on them.

**THU.**
==15==How likes she my discourse?

**PRO.**
==16==Ill, when you talk of war.

**THU.**
==17==But well, when I discourse of love and peace.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==18==But better indeed, when you hold your peace.

**THU.**
==19==What says she to my valor?

**PRO.**
==20==O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==21==She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.

**THU.**
==22==What says she to my birth?

**PRO.**
==23==That you are well deriv’d.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==24==True: from a gentleman to a fool.

**THU.**
==25==Considers she my possessions?

**PRO.**
==26==O ay; and pities them.

**THU.**
==27==Wherefore?

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==28==That such an ass should owe them.

**PRO.**
==29==That they are out by lease.

**JUL.**
==30==Here comes the Duke.

*Enter Duke.*

**DUKE.**
==31==How now, Sir Proteus? How now, Thurio?
==32==Which of you saw Eglamour of late?

**THU.**
==33==Not I.

**PRO.**
==33==    Nor I.

**DUKE.**
==33==        Saw you my daughter?

**PRO.**
==33==                     Neither.

**DUKE.**
==34==Why then
==35==She’s fled unto that peasant Valentine;
==36==And Eglamour is in her company.
==37==’Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
==38==As he in penance wander’d through the forest;
==39==Him he knew well, and guess’d that it was she,
==40==But being mask’d, he was not sure of it;
==41==Besides, she did intend confession
==42==At Patrick’s cell this even, and there she was not.
==43==These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence:
==44==Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse,
==45==But mount you presently and meet with me
==46==Upon the rising of the mountain foot
==47==That leads toward Mantua, whither they are fled.
==48==Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

*Exit.*

**THU.**
==49==Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
==50==That flies her fortune when it follows her.
==51==I’ll after, more to be reveng’d on Eglamour
==52==Than for the love of reckless Silvia.

*Exit.*

**PRO.**
==53==And I will follow, more for Silvia’s love
==54==Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==55==And I will follow, more to cross that love
==56==Than hate for Silvia, that is gone for love.

*Exit.*
