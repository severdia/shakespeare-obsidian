## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Milan. A street.*

*Enter Speed and Launce, meeting.*

**SPEED.**
Launce, by mine honesty, welcome to Milan.

**LAUNCE.**
Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never undone till he be hang’d, nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say “Welcome.”

**SPEED.**
Come on, you madcap, I’ll to the alehouse with you presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy master part with Madam Julia?

**LAUNCE.**
Marry, after they clos’d in earnest, they parted very fairly in jest.

**SPEED.**
But shall she marry him?

**LAUNCE.**
No.

**SPEED.**
How then? Shall he marry her?

**LAUNCE.**
No, neither.

**SPEED.**
What, are they broken?

**LAUNCE.**
No, they are both as whole as a fish.

**SPEED.**
Why then, how stands the matter with them?

**LAUNCE.**
Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well with her.

**SPEED.**
What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.

**LAUNCE.**
What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My staff understands me.

**SPEED.**
What thou say’st?

**LAUNCE.**
Ay, and what I do too. Look thee, I’ll but lean, and my staff understands me.

**SPEED.**
It stands under thee indeed.

**LAUNCE.**
Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.

**SPEED.**
But tell me true, will’t be a match?

**LAUNCE.**
Ask my dog. If he say ay, it will; if he say no, it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.

**SPEED.**
The conclusion is then, that it will.

**LAUNCE.**
Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.

**SPEED.**
’Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how say’st thou that my master is become a notable lover?

**LAUNCE.**
I never knew him otherwise.

**SPEED.**
Than how?

**LAUNCE.**
A notable lubber—as thou reportest him to be.

**SPEED.**
Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistak’st me.

**LAUNCE.**
Why, fool, I meant not thee, I meant thy master.

**SPEED.**
I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.

**LAUNCE.**
Why, I tell thee, I care not, though he burn himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian.

**SPEED.**
Why?

**LAUNCE.**
Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?

**SPEED.**
At thy service.

*Exeunt.*
