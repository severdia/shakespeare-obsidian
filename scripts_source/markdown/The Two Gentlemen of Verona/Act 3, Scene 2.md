## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Milan. A room in the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Duke, Thurio.*

**DUKE.**
==1== Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you
==2== Now Valentine is banish’d from her sight.

**THU.**
==3== Since his exile she hath despis’d me most,
==4== Forsworn my company, and rail’d at me,
==5== That I am desperate of obtaining her.

**DUKE.**
==6== This weak impress of love is as a figure
==7== Trenched in ice, which with an hour’s heat
==8== Dissolves to water, and doth lose his form.
==9== A little time will melt her frozen thoughts,
==10== And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
*(Enter Proteus.)*
==11== How now, Sir Proteus? Is your countryman,
==12== According to our proclamation, gone?

**PRO.**
==13== Gone, my good lord.

**DUKE.**
==14== My daughter takes his going grievously.

**PRO.**
==15== A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.

**DUKE.**
==16== So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
==17== Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee
==18== (For thou hast shown some sign of good desert) 
==19== Makes me the better to confer with thee.

**PRO.**
==20== Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace
==21== Let me not live to look upon your Grace.

**DUKE.**
==22== Thou know’st how willingly I would effect
==23== The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter?

**PRO.**
==24== I do, my lord.

**DUKE.**
==25== And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
==26== How she opposes her against my will?

**PRO.**
==27== She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.

**DUKE.**
==28== Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
==29== What might we do to make the girl forget
==30== The love of Valentine, and love Sir Thurio?

**PRO.**
==31== The best way is to slander Valentine
==32== With falsehood, cowardice, and poor descent,
==33== Three things that women highly hold in hate.

**DUKE.**
==34== Ay, but she’ll think that it is spoke in hate.

**PRO.**
==35== Ay, if his enemy deliver it;
==36== Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
==37== By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.

**DUKE.**
==38== Then you must undertake to slander him.

**PRO.**
==39== And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
==40== ’Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
==41== Especially against his very friend.

**DUKE.**
==42== Where your good word cannot advantage him,
==43== Your slander never can endamage him;
==44== Therefore the office is indifferent,
==45== Being entreated to it by your friend.

**PRO.**
==46== You have prevail’d, my lord; if I can do it
==47== By aught that I can speak in his dispraise,
==48== She shall not long continue love to him.
==49== But say this weed her love from Valentine,
==50== It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.

**THU.**
==51== Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
==52== Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
==53== You must provide to bottom it on me;
==54== Which must be done by praising me as much
==55== As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.

**DUKE.**
==56== And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
==57== Because we know (on Valentine’s report) 
==58== You are already Love’s firm votary,
==59== And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
==60== Upon this warrant shall you have access
==61== Where you with Silvia may confer at large⁠—
==62== For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
==63== And (for your friend’s sake) will be glad of you⁠—
==64== Where you may temper her by your persuasion
==65== To hate young Valentine and love my friend.

**PRO.**
==66== As much as I can do, I will effect.
==67== But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
==68== You must lay lime to tangle her desires
==69== By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
==70== Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.

**DUKE.**
==71== Ay, much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.

**PRO.**
==72== Say that upon the altar of her beauty
==73== You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart;
==74== Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
==75== Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
==76== That may discover such integrity:
==77== For Orpheus’ lute was strung with poets’ sinews,
==78== Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
==79== Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans
==80== Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
==81== After your dire-lamenting elegies,
==82== Visit by night your lady’s chamber-window
==83== With some sweet consort; to their instruments
==84== Tune a deploring dump—the night’s dead silence
==85== Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
==86== This, or else nothing, will inherit her.

**DUKE.**
==87== This discipline shows thou hast been in love.

**THU.**
==88== And thy advice this night I’ll put in practice:
==89== Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
==90== Let us into the city presently
==91== To sort some gentlemen well skill’d in music.
==92== I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
==93== To give the onset to thy good advice.

**DUKE.**
==94== About it, gentlemen!

**PRO.**
==95== We’ll wait upon your Grace till after supper,
==96== And afterward determine our proceedings.

**DUKE.**
==97== Even now about it! I will pardon you.

*Exeunt.*
