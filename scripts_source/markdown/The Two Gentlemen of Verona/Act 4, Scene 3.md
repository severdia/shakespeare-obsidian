## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Milan. Outside the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Eglamour.*

**EGL.**
==1== This is the hour that Madam Silvia
==2== Entreated me to call and know her mind.
==3== There’s some great matter she’ld employ me in.
==4== Madam, madam!

*Enter Silvia above at her window.*

**SILV.**
==4==            Who calls?

**EGL.**
==4==                 Your servant and your friend;
==5== One that attends your ladyship’s command.

**SILV.**
==6== Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.

**EGL.**
==7== As many, worthy lady, to yourself.
==8== According to your ladyship’s impose,
==9== I am thus early come to know what service
==10== It is your pleasure to command me in.

**SILV.**
==11== O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman⁠—
==12== Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not⁠—
==13== Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish’d:
==14== Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
==15== I bear unto the banish’d Valentine,
==16== Nor how my father would enforce me marry
==17== Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
==18== Thyself hast lov’d, and I have heard thee say
==19== No grief did ever come so near thy heart
==20== As when thy lady and thy true-love died,
==21== Upon whose grave thou vow’dst pure chastity.
==22== Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
==23== To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
==24== And for the ways are dangerous to pass,
==25== I do desire thy worthy company,
==26== Upon whose faith and honor I repose.
==27== Urge not my father’s anger, Eglamour,
==28== But think upon my grief, a lady’s grief,
==29== And on the justice of my flying hence,
==30== To keep me from a most unholy match,
==31== Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
==32== I do desire thee, even from a heart
==33== As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
==34== To bear me company, and go with me;
==35== If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
==36== That I may venture to depart alone.

**EGL.**
==37== Madam, I pity much your grievances,
==38== Which since I know they virtuously are plac’d,
==39== I give consent to go along with you,
==40== Reaking as little what betideth me,
==41== As much I wish all good befortune you.
==42== When will you go?

**SILV.**
==42==            This evening coming.

**EGL.**
==43== Where shall I meet you?

**SILV.**
==43==               At Friar Patrick’s cell,
==44== Where I intend holy confession.

**EGL.**
==45== I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow,
==46== Gentle lady.

**SILV.**
==46==         Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.

*Exeunt.*
