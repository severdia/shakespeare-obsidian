## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Milan. Outside the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Eglamour.*

**EGL.**
This is the hour that Madam Silvia
Entreated me to call and know her mind.
There’s some great matter she’ld employ me in.
Madam, madam!

*Enter Silvia above at her window.*

**SILV.**
           Who calls?

**EGL.**
                Your servant and your friend;
One that attends your ladyship’s command.

**SILV.**
Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.

**EGL.**
As many, worthy lady, to yourself.
According to your ladyship’s impose,
I am thus early come to know what service
It is your pleasure to command me in.

**SILV.**
O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman⁠—
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not⁠—
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish’d:
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
I bear unto the banish’d Valentine,
Nor how my father would enforce me marry
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
Thyself hast lov’d, and I have heard thee say
No grief did ever come so near thy heart
As when thy lady and thy true-love died,
Upon whose grave thou vow’dst pure chastity.
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
And for the ways are dangerous to pass,
I do desire thy worthy company,
Upon whose faith and honor I repose.
Urge not my father’s anger, Eglamour,
But think upon my grief, a lady’s grief,
And on the justice of my flying hence,
To keep me from a most unholy match,
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
I do desire thee, even from a heart
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
To bear me company, and go with me;
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
That I may venture to depart alone.

**EGL.**
Madam, I pity much your grievances,
Which since I know they virtuously are plac’d,
I give consent to go along with you,
Reaking as little what betideth me,
As much I wish all good befortune you.
When will you go?

**SILV.**
           This evening coming.

**EGL.**
Where shall I meet you?

**SILV.**
              At Friar Patrick’s cell,
Where I intend holy confession.

**EGL.**
I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow,
Gentle lady.

**SILV.**
        Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.

*Exeunt.*
