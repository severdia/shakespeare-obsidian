## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Verona. A room in Julia’s house.*

*Enter Proteus, Julia.*

**PRO.**
Have patience, gentle Julia.

**JUL.**
I must, where is no remedy.

**PRO.**
When possibly I can, I will return.

**JUL.**
If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia’s sake.

*Giving a ring.*

**PRO.**
Why then we’ll make exchange: here, take you this.

**JUL.**
And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.

**PRO.**
Here is my hand for my true constancy;
And when that hour o’erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love’s forgetfulness!
My father stays my coming; answer not;
The tide is now—nay, not thy tide of tears,
That tide will stay me longer than I should.
Julia, farewell!
*(Exit Julia.)*
        What, gone without a word?
Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak,
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

*Enter Panthino.*

**PANT.**
Sir Proteus, you are stay’d for.

**PRO.**
                Go; I come, I come.
Alas, this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.

*Exeunt.*
