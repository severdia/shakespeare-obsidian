## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Verona. A room in Julia’s house.*

*Enter Proteus, Julia.*

**PRO.**
==1==Have patience, gentle Julia.

**JUL.**
==2==I must, where is no remedy.

**PRO.**
==3==When possibly I can, I will return.

**JUL.**
==4==If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
==5==Keep this remembrance for thy Julia’s sake.

*Giving a ring.*

**PRO.**
==6==Why then we’ll make exchange: here, take you this.

**JUL.**
==7==And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.

**PRO.**
==8==Here is my hand for my true constancy;
==9==And when that hour o’erslips me in the day
==10==Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
==11==The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
==12==Torment me for my love’s forgetfulness!
==13==My father stays my coming; answer not;
==14==The tide is now—nay, not thy tide of tears,
==15==That tide will stay me longer than I should.
==16==Julia, farewell!
*(Exit Julia.)*
==16==        What, gone without a word?
==17==Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak,
==18==For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

*Enter Panthino.*

**PANT.**
==19==Sir Proteus, you are stay’d for.

**PRO.**
==19==                Go; I come, I come.
==20==Alas, this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.

*Exeunt.*
