## Act 2, Scene 6
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 7|Act 2, Scene 7 →]]

*Milan. A room in the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Proteus solus.*

**PRO.**
==1==To leave my Julia—shall I be forsworn?
==2==To love fair Silvia—shall I be forsworn?
==3==To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn.
==4==And ev’n that pow’r which gave me first my oath
==5==Provokes me to this threefold perjury.
==6==Love bade me swear, and Love bids me forswear.
==7==O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinn’d,
==8==Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
==9==At first I did adore a twinkling star,
==10==But now I worship a celestial sun.
==11==Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
==12==And he wants wit that wants resolved will
==13==To learn his wit t’ exchange the bad for better.
==14==Fie, fie, unreverend tongue, to call her bad,
==15==Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr’d
==16==With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
==17==I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
==18==But there I leave to love where I should love.
==19==Julia I lose, and Valentine I lose:
==20==If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
==21==If I lose them, thus find I by their loss⁠—
==22==For Valentine, myself; for Julia, Silvia.
==23==I to myself am dearer than a friend,
==24==For love is still most precious in itself,
==25==And Silvia (witness heaven, that made her fair) 
==26==Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
==27==I will forget that Julia is alive,
==28==Rememb’ring that my love to her is dead;
==29==And Valentine I’ll hold an enemy,
==30==Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
==31==I cannot now prove constant to myself,
==32==Without some treachery us’d to Valentine.
==33==This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
==34==To climb celestial Silvia’s chamber-window,
==35==Myself in counsel his competitor.
==36==Now presently I’ll give her father notice
==37==Of their disguising and pretended flight,
==38==Who, all enrag’d, will banish Valentine;
==39==For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
==40==But, Valentine being gone, I’ll quickly cross
==41==By some sly trick blunt Thurio’s dull proceeding.
==42==Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
==43==As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift.

*Exit.*
