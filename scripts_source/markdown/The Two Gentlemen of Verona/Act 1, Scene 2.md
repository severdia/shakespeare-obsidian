## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Verona. The garden of Julia’s house.*

*Enter Julia and Lucetta.*

**JUL.**
==1==But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
==2==Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?

**LUC.**
==3==Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.

**JUL.**
==4==Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
==5==That every day with parle encounter me,
==6==In thy opinion which is worthiest love?

**LUC.**
==7==Please you repeat their names, I’ll show my mind
==8==According to my shallow simple skill.

**JUL.**
==9==What think’st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?

**LUC.**
==10==As of a knight well-spoken, neat, and fine;
==11==But were I you, he never should be mine.

**JUL.**
==12==What think’st thou of the rich Mercatio?

**LUC.**
==13==Well of his wealth; but of himself, so, so.

**JUL.**
==14==What think’st thou of the gentle Proteus?

**LUC.**
==15==Lord, Lord! To see what folly reigns in us!

**JUL.**
==16==How now? What means this passion at his name?

**LUC.**
==17==Pardon, dear madam, ’tis a passing shame
==18==That I (unworthy body as I am) 
==19==Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.

**JUL.**
==20==Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?

**LUC.**
==21==Then thus: of many good I think him best.

**JUL.**
==22==Your reason?

**LUC.**
==23==I have no other but a woman’s reason:
==24==I think him so, because I think him so.

**JUL.**
==25==And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?

**LUC.**
==26==Ay—if you thought your love not cast away.

**JUL.**
==27==Why, he, of all the rest, hath never mov’d me.

**LUC.**
==28==Yet he, of all the rest, I think best loves ye.

**JUL.**
==29==His little speaking shows his love but small.

**LUC.**
==30==Fire that’s closest kept burns most of all.

**JUL.**
==31==They do not love that do not show their love.

**LUC.**
==32==O, they love least that let men know their love.

**JUL.**
==33==I would I knew his mind.

**LUC.**
==34==Peruse this paper, madam.

**JUL.**
==35==“To Julia”—say, from whom?

**LUC.**
==36==That the contents will show.

**JUL.**
==37==Say, say; who gave it thee?

**LUC.**
==38==Sir Valentine’s page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
==39==He would have given it you, but I, being in the way,
==40==Did in your name receive it; pardon the fault, I pray.

**JUL.**
==41==Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
==42==Dare you presume to harbor wanton lines?
==43==To whisper and conspire against my youth?
==44==Now trust me, ’tis an office of great worth,
==45==And you an officer fit for the place.
==46==There! Take the paper; see it be return’d,
==47==Or else return no more into my sight.

**LUC.**
==48==To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.

**JUL.**
==49==Will ye be gone?

**LUC.**
==49==        That you may ruminate.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==50==And yet I would I had o’erlook’d the letter;
==51==It were a shame to call her back again,
==52==And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
==53==What ’fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
==54==And would not force the letter to my view!
==55==Since maids, in modesty, say “no” to that
==56==Which they would have the profferer construe “ay.”
==57==Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,
==58==That (like a testy babe) will scratch the nurse
==59==And presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!
==60==How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
==61==When willingly I would have had her here!
==62==How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
==63==When inward joy enforc’d my heart to smile!
==64==My penance is, to call Lucetta back
==65==And ask remission for my folly past.
==66==What ho! Lucetta!

*Enter Lucetta.*

**LUC.**
==66==           What would your ladyship?

**JUL.**
==67==Is’t near dinner-time?

**LUC.**
==67==           I would it were,
==68==That you might kill your stomach on your meat,
==69==And not upon your maid.

**JUL.**
==69==              What is’t that you
==70==Took up so gingerly?

**LUC.**
==70==           Nothing.

**JUL.**
==70==                Why didst thou stoop then?

**LUC.**
==71==To take a paper up that I let fall.

**JUL.**
==72==And is that paper nothing?

**LUC.**
==72==              Nothing concerning me.

**JUL.**
==73==Then let it lie for those that it concerns.

**LUC.**
==74==Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
==75==Unless it have a false interpreter.

**JUL.**
==76==Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.

**LUC.**
==77==That I might sing it, madam, to a tune:
==78==Give me a note, your ladyship can set.

**JUL.**
==79==As little by such toys as may be possible:
==80==Best sing it to the tune of “Light o’ love.”

**LUC.**
==81==It is too heavy for so light a tune.

**JUL.**
==82==Heavy? Belike it hath some burden then?

**LUC.**
==83==Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.

**JUL.**
==84==And why not you?

**LUC.**
==84==           I cannot reach so high.

**JUL.**
==85==Let’s see your song.
*(Takes the letter.)*
==85==           How now, minion?

**LUC.**
==86==Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out.
==87==And yet methinks I do not like this tune.

**JUL.**
==88==You do not?

**LUC.**
==88==        No, madam, ’tis too sharp.

**JUL.**
==89==You, minion, are too saucy.

**LUC.**
==90==Nay, now you are too flat,
==91==And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
==92==There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.

**JUL.**
==93==The mean is drown’d with your unruly bass.

**LUC.**
==94==Indeed I bid the base for Proteus.

**JUL.**
==95==This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
==96==Here is a coil with protestation!
*(Tears the letter.)*
==97==Go, get you gone; and let the papers lie:
==98==You would be fing’ring them, to anger me.

**LUC.**
==99==She makes it strange, but she would be best pleas’d
==100==To be so ang’red with another letter.

*Exit.*

**JUL.**
==101==Nay, would I were so ang’red with the same.
==102==O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
==103==Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey,
==104==And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
==105==I’ll kiss each several paper for amends.
==106==Look, here is writ “kind Julia.” Unkind Julia,
==107==As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
==108==I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
==109==Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
==110==And here is writ “love-wounded Proteus.”
==111==Poor wounded name: my bosom as a bed
==112==Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal’d;
==113==And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
==114==But twice, or thrice, was “Proteus” written down:
==115==Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
==116==Till I have found each letter in the letter,
==117==Except mine own name; that, some whirlwind bear
==118==Unto a ragged, fearful, hanging rock,
==119==And throw it thence into the raging sea.
==120==Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
==121==“Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus:
==122==To the sweet Julia”—that I’ll tear away⁠—
==123==And yet I will not, sith so prettily
==124==He couples it to his complaining names.
==125==Thus will I fold them one upon another;
==126==Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

*Enter Lucetta.*

**LUC.**
==127==Madam,
==128==Dinner is ready, and your father stays.

**JUL.**
==129==Well, let us go.

**LUC.**
==130==What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?

**JUL.**
==131==If you respect them, best to take them up.

**LUC.**
==132==Nay, I was taken up for laying them down;
==133==Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.

**JUL.**
==134==I see you have a month’s mind to them.

**LUC.**
==135==Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
==136==I see things too, although you judge I wink.

**JUL.**
==137==Come, come, will’t please you go?

*Exeunt.*
