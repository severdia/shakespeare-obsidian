## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Verona. A room in Antonio’s house.*

*Enter Antonio and Panthino.*

**ANT.**
==1==Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
==2==Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?

**PANT.**
==3==’Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.

**ANT.**
==4==Why, what of him?

**PANT.**
==4==           He wond’red that your lordship
==5==Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
==6==While other men, of slender reputation,
==7==Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
==8==Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
==9==Some to discover islands far away;
==10==Some to the studious universities.
==11==For any or for all these exercises
==12==He said that Proteus, your son, was meet;
==13==And did request me to importune you
==14==To let him spend his time no more at home,
==15==Which would be great impeachment to his age,
==16==In having known no travel in his youth.

**ANT.**
==17==Nor need’st thou much importune me to that
==18==Whereon this month I have been hammering.
==19==I have consider’d well his loss of time,
==20==And how he cannot be a perfect man,
==21==Not being tried and tutor’d in the world:
==22==Experience is by industry achiev’d,
==23==And perfected by the swift course of time.
==24==Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?

**PANT.**
==25==I think your lordship is not ignorant
==26==How his companion, youthful Valentine,
==27==Attends the Emperor in his royal court.

**ANT.**
==28==I know it well.

**PANT.**
==29==’Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
==30==There shall he practice tilts and tournaments,
==31==Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen,
==32==And be in eye of every exercise
==33==Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.

**ANT.**
==34==I like thy counsel; well hast thou advis’d;
==35==And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
==36==The execution of it shall make known:
==37==Even with the speediest expedition
==38==I will dispatch him to the Emperor’s court.

**PANT.**
==39==Tomorrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso
==40==With other gentlemen of good esteem
==41==Are journeying to salute the Emperor,
==42==And to commend their service to his will.

**ANT.**
==43==Good company; with them shall Proteus go⁠—
*(Enter Proteus.)*
==44==And in good time! Now will we break with him.

**PRO.**
==45==Sweet love, sweet lines, sweet life!
==46==Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
==47==Here is her oath for love, her honor’s pawn:
==48==O that our fathers would applaud our loves,
==49==To seal our happiness with their consents!
==50==O heavenly Julia!

**ANT.**
==51==How now? What letter are you reading there?

**PRO.**
==52==May’t please your lordship, ’tis a word or two
==53==Of commendations sent from Valentine,
==54==Deliver’d by a friend that came from him.

**ANT.**
==55==Lend me the letter; let me see what news.

**PRO.**
==56==There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
==57==How happily he lives, how well-belov’d
==58==And daily graced by the Emperor;
==59==Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.

**ANT.**
==60==And how stand you affected to his wish?

**PRO.**
==61==As one relying on your lordship’s will,
==62==And not depending on his friendly wish.

**ANT.**
==63==My will is something sorted with his wish:
==64==Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
==65==For what I will, I will, and there an end.
==66==I am resolv’d that thou shalt spend some time
==67==With Valentinus in the Emperor’s court;
==68==What maintenance he from his friends receives,
==69==Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
==70==Tomorrow be in readiness to go⁠—
==71==Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.

**PRO.**
==72==My lord I cannot be so soon provided:
==73==Please you deliberate a day or two.

**ANT.**
==74==Look what thou want’st shall be sent after thee.
==75==No more of stay: tomorrow thou must go.
==76==Come on, Panthino; you shall be employ’d
==77==To hasten on his expedition.

*Exeunt Antonio and Panthino.*

**PRO.**
==78==Thus have I shunn’d the fire for fear of burning,
==79==And drench’d me in the sea, where I am drown’d.
==80==I fear’d to show my father Julia’s letter,
==81==Lest he should take exceptions to my love,
==82==And with the vantage of mine own excuse
==83==Hath he excepted most against my love.
==84==O, how this spring of love resembleth
==85==The uncertain glory of an April day,
==86==Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
==87==And by and by a cloud takes all away.

*Enter Panthino.*

**PANT.**
==88==Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:
==89==He is in haste; therefore I pray you go.

**PRO.**
==90==Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
==91==And yet a thousand times it answers “no.”

*Exeunt.*
