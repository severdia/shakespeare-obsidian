## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The frontiers of Mantua. A forest between Milan and Verona.*

*Enter Silvia, Outlaws.*

**1. OUT.**
Come, come,
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

**SILV.**
A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn’d me how to brook this patiently.

**2. OUT.**
Come, bring her away.

**1. OUT.**
Where is the gentleman that was with her?

**3. OUT.**
Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain. We’ll follow him that’s fled⁠—
The thicket is beset, he cannot scape.

**1. OUT.**
Come, I must bring you to our captain’s cave.
Fear not; he bears an honorable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.

**SILV.**
O Valentine, this I endure for thee!

*Exeunt.*
