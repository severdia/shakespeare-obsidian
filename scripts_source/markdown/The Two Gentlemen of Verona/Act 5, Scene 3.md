## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The frontiers of Mantua. A forest between Milan and Verona.*

*Enter Silvia, Outlaws.*

**1. OUT.**
==1==Come, come,
==2==Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

**SILV.**
==3==A thousand more mischances than this one
==4==Have learn’d me how to brook this patiently.

**2. OUT.**
==5==Come, bring her away.

**1. OUT.**
==6==Where is the gentleman that was with her?

**3. OUT.**
==7==Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
==8==But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
==9==Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
==10==There is our captain. We’ll follow him that’s fled⁠—
==11==The thicket is beset, he cannot scape.

**1. OUT.**
==12==Come, I must bring you to our captain’s cave.
==13==Fear not; he bears an honorable mind,
==14==And will not use a woman lawlessly.

**SILV.**
==15==O Valentine, this I endure for thee!

*Exeunt.*
