## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Verona. An open place.*

*Enter Valentine, Proteus.*

**VAL.**
==1==Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
==2==Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
==3==Were’t not affection chains thy tender days
==4==To the sweet glances of thy honor’d love,
==5==I rather would entreat thy company,
==6==To see the wonders of the world abroad,
==7==Than (living dully sluggardiz’d at home) 
==8==Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
==9==But since thou lov’st, love still, and thrive therein,
==10==Even as I would, when I to love begin.

**PRO.**
==11==Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, *adieu*,
==12==Think on thy Proteus, when thou, happ’ly, seest
==13==Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel.
==14==Wish me partaker in thy happiness
==15==When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger
==16==(If ever danger do environ thee) 
==17==Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
==18==For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.

**VAL.**
==19==And on a love-book pray for my success?

**PRO.**
==20==Upon some book I love I’ll pray for thee.

**VAL.**
==21==That’s on some shallow story of deep love,
==22==How young Leander cross’d the Hellespont.

**PRO.**
==23==That’s a deep story of a deeper love,
==24==For he was more than over shoes in love.

**VAL.**
==25==’Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
==26==And yet you never swom the Hellespont.

**PRO.**
==27==Over the boots? Nay, give me not the boots.

**VAL.**
==28==No, I will not; for it boots thee not.

**PRO.**
==28==                  What?

**VAL.**
==29==To be in love—where scorn is bought with groans;
==30==Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment’s mirth
==31==With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
==32==If happ’ly won, perhaps a hapless gain;
==33==If lost, why then a grievous labor won;
==34==However—but a folly bought with wit,
==35==Or else a wit by folly vanquished.

**PRO.**
==36==So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.

**VAL.**
==37==So, by your circumstance, I fear you’ll prove.

**PRO.**
==38==’Tis love you cavil at, I am not Love.

**VAL.**
==39==Love is your master, for he masters you;
==40==And he that is so yoked by a fool,
==41==Methinks should not be chronicled for wise.

**PRO.**
==42==Yet writers say: as in the sweetest bud
==43==The eating canker dwells, so eating love
==44==Inhabits in the finest wits of all.

**VAL.**
==45==And writers say: as the most forward bud
==46==Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
==47==Even so by love the young and tender wit
==48==Is turn’d to folly, blasting in the bud,
==49==Losing his verdure, even in the prime,
==50==And all the fair effects of future hopes.
==51==But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee
==52==That art a votary to fond desire?
==53==Once more *adieu*. My father at the road
==54==Expects my coming, there to see me shipp’d.

**PRO.**
==55==And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.

**VAL.**
==56==Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
==57==To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
==58==Of thy success in love, and what news else
==59==Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
==60==And I likewise will visit thee with mine.

**PRO.**
==61==All happiness bechance to thee in Milan.

**VAL.**
==62==As much to you at home; and so farewell.

*Exit.*

**PRO.**
==63==He after honor hunts, I after love:
==64==He leaves his friends, to dignify them more;
==65==I leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.
==66==Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphis’d me,
==67==Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
==68==War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
==69==Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

*Enter Speed.*

**SPEED.**
==70==Sir Proteus! ’Save you! Saw you my master?

**PRO.**
==71==But now he parted hence to embark for Milan.

**SPEED.**
==72==Twenty to one then he is shipp’d already,
==73==And I have play’d the sheep in losing him.

**PRO.**
==74==Indeed a sheep doth very often stray,
==75==And if the shepherd be awhile away.

**SPEED.**
==76==You conclude that my master is a shepherd then, and I a sheep?

**PRO.**
==77==I do.

**SPEED.**
==78==Why then my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.

**PRO.**
==79==A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.

**SPEED.**
==80==This proves me still a sheep.

**PRO.**
==81==True; and thy master a shepherd.

**SPEED.**
==82==Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.

**PRO.**
==83==It shall go hard but I’ll prove it by another.

**SPEED.**
==84==The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me: therefore I am no sheep.

**PRO.**
==85==The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the shepherd for food follows not the sheep; thou for wages followest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.

**SPEED.**
==86==Such another proof will make me cry “baa.”

**PRO.**
==87==But dost thou hear? Gav’st thou my letter to Julia?

**SPEED.**
==88==Ay, sir; I (a lost mutton) gave your letter to her (a lac’d mutton), and she (a lac’d mutton) gave me (a lost mutton) nothing for my labor.

**PRO.**
==89==Here’s too small a pasture for such store of muttons.

**SPEED.**
==90==If the ground be overcharg’d, you were best stick her.

**PRO.**
==91==Nay, in that you are astray; ’twere best pound you.

**SPEED.**
==92==Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.

**PRO.**
==93==You mistake; I mean the pound—a pinfold.

**SPEED.**
==94==From a pound to a pin? Fold it over and over,
==95==’Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.

**PRO.**
==96==But what said she?

*Speed nods, and Proteus looks at him questioningly.*

**SPEED.**
==97==Ay.

**PRO.**
==98==Nod-ay—why, that’s “noddy.”

**SPEED.**
==99==You mistook, sir: I say, she did nod; and you ask me if she did nod, and I say, “Ay.”

**PRO.**
==100==And that set together is “noddy.”

**SPEED.**
==101==Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.

**PRO.**
==102==No, no, you shall have it for bearing the letter.

**SPEED.**
==103==Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.

**PRO.**
==104==Why, sir, how do you bear with me?

**SPEED.**
==105==Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly, having nothing but the word “noddy” for my pains.

**PRO.**
==106==Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.

**SPEED.**
==107==And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.

**PRO.**
==108==Come, come, open the matter in brief: what said she?

**SPEED.**
==109==Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once deliver’d.

**PRO.**
==110==Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?

**SPEED.**
==111==Truly, sir, I think you’ll hardly win her.

**PRO.**
==112==Why? Couldst thou perceive so much from her?

**SPEED.**
==113==Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter: and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she’ll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones, for she’s as hard as steel.

**PRO.**
==114==What said she? Nothing?

**SPEED.**
==115==No, not so much as “Take this for thy pains.” To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testern’d me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself: and so, sir, I’ll commend you to my master.

**PRO.**
==116==Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wrack,
==117==Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
==118==Being destin’d to a drier death on shore.
*(Exit Speed.)*
==119==I must go send some better messenger:
==120==I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
==121==Receiving them from such a worthless post.

*Exit.*
