## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Milan. Outside the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Proteus.*

**PRO.**
==1==Already have I been false to Valentine,
==2==And now I must be as unjust to Thurio:
==3==Under the color of commending him,
==4==I have access my own love to prefer⁠—
==5==But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
==6==To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
==7==When I protest true loyalty to her,
==8==She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
==9==When to her beauty I commend my vows,
==10==She bids me think how I have been forsworn
==11==In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov’d;
==12==And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
==13==The least whereof would quell a lover’s hope,
==14==Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
==15==The more it grows, and fawneth on her still.
*(Enter Thurio, Musicians.)*
==16==But here comes Thurio. Now must we to her window,
==17==And give some evening music to her ear.

**THU.**
==18==How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?

**PRO.**
==19==Ay, gentle Thurio, for you know that love
==20==Will creep in service where it cannot go.

**THU.**
==21==Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.

**PRO.**
==22==Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.

**THU.**
==23==Who? Silvia?

**PRO.**
==23==        Ay, Silvia—for your sake.

**THU.**
==24==I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
==25==Let’s tune, and to it lustily a while.

*Enter at one side Host, Julia in boy’s clothes, as Sebastian.*

**HOST.**
==26==Now, my young guest, methinks you’re allycholly; I pray you, why is it?

**JUL.**
==27==Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.

**HOST.**
==28==Come, we’ll have you merry: I’ll bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you ask’d for.

**JUL.**
==29==But shall I hear him speak?

**HOST.**
==30==Ay, that you shall.

**JUL.**
==31==That will be music.

*Music plays.*

**HOST.**
==32==Hark, hark!

**JUL.**
==33==Is he among these?

**HOST.**
==34==Ay; but peace, let’s hear ’em.
*(Song.)*
==35==*Who is Silvia? What is she,*
==36==*That all our swains commend her?*
==37==*Holy, fair, and wise is she;*
==38==*The heaven such grace did lend her,*
==39==*That she might admired be.*
==40==*Is she kind as she is fair?*
==41==*For beauty lives with kindness.*
==42==*Love doth to her eyes repair,*
==43==*To help him of his blindness;*
==44==*And, being help’d, inhabits there.*
==45==*Then to Silvia let us sing,*
==46==*That Silvia is excelling;*
==47==*She excels each mortal thing*
==48==*Upon the dull earth dwelling.*
==49==*To her let us garlands bring.*

**HOST.**
==50==How now? Are you sadder than you were before? How do you, man? The music likes you not.

**JUL.**
==51==You mistake; the musician likes me not.

**HOST.**
==52==Why, my pretty youth?

**JUL.**
==53==He plays false, father.

**HOST.**
==54==How, out of tune on the strings?

**JUL.**
==55==Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very heart-strings.

**HOST.**
==56==You have a quick ear.

**JUL.**
==57==Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.

**HOST.**
==58==I perceive you delight not in music.

**JUL.**
==59==Not a whit, when it jars so.

**HOST.**
==60==Hark, what fine change is in the music.

**JUL.**
==61==Ay; that change is the spite.

**HOST.**
==62==You would have them always play but one thing?

**JUL.**
==63==I would always have one play but one thing.
==64==But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
==65==Often resort unto this gentlewoman?

**HOST.**
==66==I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he lov’d her out of all nick.

**JUL.**
==67==Where is Launce?

**HOST.**
==68==Gone to seek his dog, which tomorrow, by his master’s command, he must carry for a present to his lady.

**JUL.**
==69==Peace, stand aside, the company parts.

**PRO.**
==70==Sir Thurio, fear not you, I will so plead,
==71==That you shall say my cunning drift excels.

**THU.**
==72==Where meet we?

**PRO.**
==72==        At Saint Gregory’s well.

**THU.**
==72==                     Farewell.

*Exeunt Thurio and Musicians.*

*Enter Silvia above at her window.*

**PRO.**
==73==Madam, good ev’n to your ladyship.

**SILV.**
==74==I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
==75==Who is that that spake?

**PRO.**
==76==One, lady, if you knew his pure heart’s truth,
==77==You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.

**SILV.**
==78==Sir Proteus, as I take it.

**PRO.**
==79==Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.

**SILV.**
==80==What’s your will?

**PRO.**
==80==           That I may compass yours.

**SILV.**
==81==You have your wish: my will is even this,
==82==That presently you hie you home to bed.
==83==Thou subtile, perjur’d, false, disloyal man,
==84==Think’st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
==85==To be seduced by thy flattery,
==86==That hast deceiv’d so many with thy vows?
==87==Return, return, and make thy love amends.
==88==For me (by this pale queen of night I swear),
==89==I am so far from granting thy request,
==90==That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
==91==And by and by intend to chide myself
==92==Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.

**PRO.**
==93==I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
==94==But she is dead.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==94==        ’Twere false, if I should speak it;
==95==For I am sure she is not buried.

**SILV.**
==96==Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
==97==Survives; to whom (thyself art witness) 
==98==I am betroth’d; and art thou not asham’d
==99==To wrong him with thy importunacy?

**PRO.**
==100==I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.

**SILV.**
==101==And so suppose am I; for in his grave
==102==Assure thyself my love is buried.

**PRO.**
==103==Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.

**SILV.**
==104==Go to thy lady’s grave and call hers thence,
==105==Or at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==106==He heard not that.

**PRO.**
==107==Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
==108==Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
==109==The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
==110==To that I’ll speak, to that I’ll sigh and weep;
==111==For since the substance of your perfect self
==112==Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
==113==And to your shadow will I make true love.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
==114==If ’twere a substance, you would sure deceive it,
==115==And make it but a shadow, as I am.

**SILV.**
==116==I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
==117==But since your falsehood shall become you well
==118==To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
==119==Send to me in the morning, and I’ll send it;
==120==And so, good rest.

**PRO.**
==120==           As wretches have o’ernight
==121==That wait for execution in the morn.

*Exeunt Proteus and Silvia.*

**JUL.**
==122==Host, will you go?

**HOST.**
==123==By my halidom, I was fast asleep.

**JUL.**
==124==Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?

**HOST.**
==125==Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think ’tis almost day.

**JUL.**
==126==Not so; but it hath been the longest night
==127==That e’er I watch’d, and the most heaviest.

*Exeunt.*
