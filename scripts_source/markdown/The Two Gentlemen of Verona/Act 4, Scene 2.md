## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Milan. Outside the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Proteus.*

**PRO.**
Already have I been false to Valentine,
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio:
Under the color of commending him,
I have access my own love to prefer⁠—
But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
When I protest true loyalty to her,
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
When to her beauty I commend my vows,
She bids me think how I have been forsworn
In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov’d;
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
The least whereof would quell a lover’s hope,
Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
The more it grows, and fawneth on her still.
*(Enter Thurio, Musicians.)*
But here comes Thurio. Now must we to her window,
And give some evening music to her ear.

**THU.**
How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?

**PRO.**
Ay, gentle Thurio, for you know that love
Will creep in service where it cannot go.

**THU.**
Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.

**PRO.**
Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.

**THU.**
Who? Silvia?

**PRO.**
        Ay, Silvia—for your sake.

**THU.**
I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
Let’s tune, and to it lustily a while.

*Enter at one side Host, Julia in boy’s clothes, as Sebastian.*

**HOST.**
Now, my young guest, methinks you’re allycholly; I pray you, why is it?

**JUL.**
Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.

**HOST.**
Come, we’ll have you merry: I’ll bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you ask’d for.

**JUL.**
But shall I hear him speak?

**HOST.**
Ay, that you shall.

**JUL.**
That will be music.

*Music plays.*

**HOST.**
Hark, hark!

**JUL.**
Is he among these?

**HOST.**
Ay; but peace, let’s hear ’em.
*(Song.)*
*Who is Silvia? What is she,*
*That all our swains commend her?*
*Holy, fair, and wise is she;*
*The heaven such grace did lend her,*
*That she might admired be.*
*Is she kind as she is fair?*
*For beauty lives with kindness.*
*Love doth to her eyes repair,*
*To help him of his blindness;*
*And, being help’d, inhabits there.*
*Then to Silvia let us sing,*
*That Silvia is excelling;*
*She excels each mortal thing*
*Upon the dull earth dwelling.*
*To her let us garlands bring.*

**HOST.**
How now? Are you sadder than you were before? How do you, man? The music likes you not.

**JUL.**
You mistake; the musician likes me not.

**HOST.**
Why, my pretty youth?

**JUL.**
He plays false, father.

**HOST.**
How, out of tune on the strings?

**JUL.**
Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very heart-strings.

**HOST.**
You have a quick ear.

**JUL.**
Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.

**HOST.**
I perceive you delight not in music.

**JUL.**
Not a whit, when it jars so.

**HOST.**
Hark, what fine change is in the music.

**JUL.**
Ay; that change is the spite.

**HOST.**
You would have them always play but one thing?

**JUL.**
I would always have one play but one thing.
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?

**HOST.**
I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he lov’d her out of all nick.

**JUL.**
Where is Launce?

**HOST.**
Gone to seek his dog, which tomorrow, by his master’s command, he must carry for a present to his lady.

**JUL.**
Peace, stand aside, the company parts.

**PRO.**
Sir Thurio, fear not you, I will so plead,
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.

**THU.**
Where meet we?

**PRO.**
        At Saint Gregory’s well.

**THU.**
                     Farewell.

*Exeunt Thurio and Musicians.*

*Enter Silvia above at her window.*

**PRO.**
Madam, good ev’n to your ladyship.

**SILV.**
I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
Who is that that spake?

**PRO.**
One, lady, if you knew his pure heart’s truth,
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.

**SILV.**
Sir Proteus, as I take it.

**PRO.**
Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.

**SILV.**
What’s your will?

**PRO.**
           That I may compass yours.

**SILV.**
You have your wish: my will is even this,
That presently you hie you home to bed.
Thou subtile, perjur’d, false, disloyal man,
Think’st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
To be seduced by thy flattery,
That hast deceiv’d so many with thy vows?
Return, return, and make thy love amends.
For me (by this pale queen of night I swear),
I am so far from granting thy request,
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
And by and by intend to chide myself
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.

**PRO.**
I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
But she is dead.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
        ’Twere false, if I should speak it;
For I am sure she is not buried.

**SILV.**
Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
Survives; to whom (thyself art witness) 
I am betroth’d; and art thou not asham’d
To wrong him with thy importunacy?

**PRO.**
I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.

**SILV.**
And so suppose am I; for in his grave
Assure thyself my love is buried.

**PRO.**
Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.

**SILV.**
Go to thy lady’s grave and call hers thence,
Or at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
He heard not that.

**PRO.**
Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
To that I’ll speak, to that I’ll sigh and weep;
For since the substance of your perfect self
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
And to your shadow will I make true love.

**JUL.**
*(Aside.)*
If ’twere a substance, you would sure deceive it,
And make it but a shadow, as I am.

**SILV.**
I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
But since your falsehood shall become you well
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
Send to me in the morning, and I’ll send it;
And so, good rest.

**PRO.**
           As wretches have o’ernight
That wait for execution in the morn.

*Exeunt Proteus and Silvia.*

**JUL.**
Host, will you go?

**HOST.**
By my halidom, I was fast asleep.

**JUL.**
Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?

**HOST.**
Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think ’tis almost day.

**JUL.**
Not so; but it hath been the longest night
That e’er I watch’d, and the most heaviest.

*Exeunt.*
