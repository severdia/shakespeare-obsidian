## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 7|← Act 2, Scene 7]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Milan. An anteroom in the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Duke, Thurio, Proteus.*

**DUKE.**
==1==Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, a while,
==2==We have some secrets to confer about.
*(Exit Thurio.)*
==3==Now tell me, Proteus, what’s your will with me?

**PRO.**
==4==My gracious lord, that which I would discover
==5==The law of friendship bids me to conceal,
==6==But when I call to mind your gracious favors
==7==Done to me (undeserving as I am),
==8==My duty pricks me on to utter that
==9==Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
==10==Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
==11==This night intends to steal away your daughter;
==12==Myself am one made privy to the plot.
==13==I know you have determin’d to bestow her
==14==On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates,
==15==And should she thus be stol’n away from you,
==16==It would be much vexation to your age.
==17==Thus, for my duty’s sake, I rather chose
==18==To cross my friend in his intended drift,
==19==Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
==20==A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
==21==Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.

**DUKE.**
==22==Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care,
==23==Which to requite, command me while I live.
==24==This love of theirs myself have often seen,
==25==Haply when they have judg’d me fast asleep,
==26==And oftentimes have purpos’d to forbid
==27==Sir Valentine her company and my court;
==28==But fearing lest my jealous aim might err,
==29==And so, unworthily, disgrace the man
==30==(A rashness that I ever yet have shunn’d),
==31==I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
==32==That which thyself hast now disclos’d to me.
==33==And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
==34==Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
==35==I nightly lodge her in an upper tow’r,
==36==The key whereof myself have ever kept;
==37==And thence she cannot be convey’d away.

**PRO.**
==38==Know, noble lord, they have devis’d a mean
==39==How he her chamber-window will ascend,
==40==And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
==41==For which the youthful lover now is gone,
==42==And this way comes he with it presently,
==43==Where (if it please you) you may intercept him.
==44==But, good my lord, do it so cunningly
==45==That my discovery be not aimed at:
==46==For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
==47==Hath made me publisher of this pretense.

**DUKE.**
==48==Upon mine honor, he shall never know
==49==That I had any light from thee of this.

**PRO.**
==50==*Adieu*, my lord, Sir Valentine is coming.

*Exit.*

*Enter Valentine.*

**DUKE.**
==51==Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?

**VAL.**
==52==Please it your Grace, there is a messenger
==53==That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
==54==And I am going to deliver them.

**DUKE.**
==55==Be they of much import?

**VAL.**
==56==The tenure of them doth but signify
==57==My health and happy being at your court.

**DUKE.**
==58==Nay then no matter; stay with me a while;
==59==I am to break with thee of some affairs
==60==That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
==61==’Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
==62==To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.

**VAL.**
==63==I know it well, my lord, and sure the match
==64==Were rich and honorable; besides, the gentleman
==65==Is full of virtue, bounty, worth, and qualities
==66==Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter.
==67==Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?

**DUKE.**
==68==No, trust me, she is peevish, sullen, froward,
==69==Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
==70==Neither regarding that she is my child,
==71==Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
==72==And may I say to thee, this pride of hers
==73==(Upon advice) hath drawn my love from her,
==74==And where I thought the remnant of mine age
==75==Should have been cherish’d by her child-like duty,
==76==I now am full resolv’d to take a wife,
==77==And turn her out to who will take her in:
==78==Then let her beauty be her wedding-dow’r,
==79==For me and my possessions she esteems not.

**VAL.**
==80==What would your Grace have me to do in this?

**DUKE.**
==81==There is a lady in Milano here
==82==Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy,
==83==And nought esteems my aged eloquence.
==84==Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor
==85==(For long agone I have forgot to court;
==86==Besides, the fashion of the time is chang’d) 
==87==How and which way I may bestow myself
==88==To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.

**VAL.**
==89==Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
==90==Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
==91==More than quick words do move a woman’s mind.

**DUKE.**
==92==But she did scorn a present that I sent her.

**VAL.**
==93==A woman sometime scorns what best contents her.
==94==Send her another; never give her o’er,
==95==For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
==96==If she do frown, ’tis not in hate of you,
==97==But rather to beget more love in you.
==98==If she do chide, ’tis not to have you gone,
==99==For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
==100==Take no repulse, what ever she doth say;
==101==For “get you gone,” she doth not mean “away!”
==102==Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
==103==Though ne’er so black, say they have angels’ faces.
==104==That man that hath a tongue, I say is no man,
==105==If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.

**DUKE.**
==106==But she I mean is promis’d by her friends
==107==Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
==108==And kept severely from resort of men,
==109==That no man hath access by day to her.

**VAL.**
==110==Why then I would resort to her by night.

**DUKE.**
==111==Ay, but the doors be lock’d, and keys kept safe,
==112==That no man hath recourse to her by night.

**VAL.**
==113==What lets but one may enter at her window?

**DUKE.**
==114==Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
==115==And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
==116==Without apparent hazard of his life.

**VAL.**
==117==Why then a ladder, quaintly made of cords,
==118==To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
==119==Would serve to scale another Hero’s tow’r,
==120==So bold Leander would adventure it.

**DUKE.**
==121==Now as thou art a gentleman of blood,
==122==Advise me where I may have such a ladder.

**VAL.**
==123==When would you use it? Pray, sir, tell me that.

**DUKE.**
==124==This very night; for Love is like a child,
==125==That longs for every thing that he can come by.

**VAL.**
==126==By seven o’clock I’ll get you such a ladder.

**DUKE.**
==127==But hark thee: I will go to her alone.
==128==How shall I best convey the ladder thither?

**VAL.**
==129==It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
==130==Under a cloak that is of any length.

**DUKE.**
==131==A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?

**VAL.**
==132==Ay, my good lord.

**DUKE.**
==132==           Then let me see thy cloak⁠—
==133==I’ll get me one of such another length.

**VAL.**
==134==Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.

**DUKE.**
==135==How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
==136==I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me.
==137==What letter is this same? What’s here? “To Silvia”?
==138==And here an engine fit for my proceeding!
==139==I’ll be so bold to break the seal for once.
*(Reads.)*
==140==*“My thoughts do harbor with my Silvia nightly,*
==141==*And slaves they are to me that send them flying:*
==142==*O, could their master come and go as lightly,*
==143==*Himself would lodge where, senseless, they are lying!*
==144==*My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them,*
==145==*While I, their king, that thither them importune,*
==146==*Do curse the grace that with such grace hath blest them,*
==147==*Because myself do want my servants’ fortune.*
==148==*I curse myself, for they are sent by me,*
==149==*That they should harbor where their lord should be.”*
==150==What’s here?
==151==*“Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.”*
==152==’Tis so; and here’s the ladder for the purpose.
==153==Why, Phaëton (for thou art Merops’ son),
==154==Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,
==155==And with thy daring folly burn the world?
==156==Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
==157==Go, base intruder, overweening slave,
==158==Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
==159==And think my patience (more than thy desert) 
==160==Is privilege for thy departure hence.
==161==Thank me for this more than for all the favors
==162==Which (all too much) I have bestowed on thee.
==163==But if thou linger in my territories
==164==Longer than swiftest expedition
==165==Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
==166==By heaven, my wrath shall far exceed the love
==167==I ever bore my daughter, or thyself.
==168==Be gone, I will not hear thy vain excuse,
==169==But as thou lov’st thy life, make speed from hence.

*Exit.*

**VAL.**
==170==And why not death, rather than living torment?
==171==To die is to be banish’d from myself,
==172==And Silvia is myself: banish’d from her
==173==Is self from self, a deadly banishment.
==174==What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
==175==What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
==176==Unless it be to think that she is by,
==177==And feed upon the shadow of perfection.
==178==Except I be by Silvia in the night,
==179==There is no music in the nightingale;
==180==Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
==181==There is no day for me to look upon.
==182==She is my essence, and I leave to be,
==183==If I be not by her fair influence
==184==Foster’d, illumin’d, cherish’d, kept alive.
==185==I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
==186==Tarry I here, I but attend on death,
==187==But fly I hence, I fly away from life.

*Enter Proteus and Launce.*

**PRO.**
==188==Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.

**LAUNCE.**
==189==Soho, soho!

**PRO.**
==190==What seest thou?

**LAUNCE.**
==191==Him we go to find. There’s not a hair on ’s head but ’tis a Valentine.

**PRO.**
==192==Valentine?

**VAL.**
==193==No.

**PRO.**
==194==Who then? His spirit?

**VAL.**
==195==Neither.

**PRO.**
==196==What then?

**VAL.**
==197==Nothing.

**LAUNCE.**
==198==Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?

**PRO.**
==199==Who wouldst thou strike?

**LAUNCE.**
==200==Nothing.

**PRO.**
==201==Villain, forbear.

**LAUNCE.**
==202==Why, sir, I’ll strike nothing. I pray you⁠—

**PRO.**
==203==Sirrah, I say forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.

**VAL.**
==204==My ears are stopp’d and cannot hear good news,
==205==So much of bad already hath possess’d them.

**PRO.**
==206==Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
==207==For they are harsh, untuneable, and bad.

**VAL.**
==208==Is Silvia dead?

**PRO.**
==209==No, Valentine.

**VAL.**
==210==No Valentine indeed, for sacred Silvia.
==211==Hath she forsworn me?

**PRO.**
==212==No, Valentine.

**VAL.**
==213==No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me. What is your news?

**LAUNCE.**
==214==Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanish’d.

**PRO.**
==215==That thou art banish’d—O, that’s the news!⁠—
==216==From hence, from Silvia, and from me thy friend.

**VAL.**
==217==O, I have fed upon this woe already,
==218==And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
==219==Doth Silvia know that I am banished?

**PRO.**
==220==Ay, ay; and she hath offered to the doom
==221==(Which unrevers’d stands in effectual force) 
==222==A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears;
==223==Those at her father’s churlish feet she tender’d,
==224==With them, upon her knees, her humble self,
==225==Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
==226==As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
==227==But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
==228==Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears
==229==Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
==230==But Valentine, if he be ta’en, must die.
==231==Besides, her intercession chaf’d him so,
==232==When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
==233==That to close prison he commanded her,
==234==With many bitter threats of biding there.

**VAL.**
==235==No more; unless the next word that thou speak’st
==236==Have some malignant power upon my life;
==237==If so—I pray thee breathe it in mine ear,
==238==As ending anthem of my endless dolor.

**PRO.**
==239==Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
==240==And study help for that which thou lament’st.
==241==Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
==242==Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
==243==Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
==244==Hope is a lover’s staff; walk hence with that
==245==And manage it against despairing thoughts.
==246==Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence,
==247==Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver’d
==248==Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
==249==The time now serves not to expostulate:
==250==Come, I’ll convey thee through the city-gate;
==251==And ere I part with thee, confer at large
==252==Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
==253==As thou lov’st Silvia (though not for thyself) 
==254==Regard thy danger, and along with me.

**VAL.**
==255==I pray thee, Launce, and if thou seest my boy,
==256==Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.

**PRO.**
==257==Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.

**VAL.**
==258==O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!

*Exeunt Valentine and Proteus.*

**LAUNCE.**
==259==I am but a fool, look you, and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave; but that’s all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love, yet I am in love, but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who ’tis I love; and yet ’tis a woman; but what woman, I will not tell myself; and yet ’tis a milkmaid; yet ’tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet ’tis a maid, for she is her master’s maid, and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel, which is much in a bare Christian.
*(Pulling out a paper.)*
==260==Here is the cate-log of her condition. “Imprimis, She can fetch and carry.” Why, a horse can do no more; nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only carry, therefore is she better than a jade. “Item, She can milk.” Look you, a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands.

*Enter Speed.*

**SPEED.**
==261==How now, *Signior* Launce? What news with your mastership?

**LAUNCE.**
==262==With my master’s ship? Why, it is at sea.

**SPEED.**
==263==Well, your old vice still: mistake the word. What news then in your paper?

**LAUNCE.**
==264==The blackest news that ever thou heardst.

**SPEED.**
==265==Why, man? How black?

**LAUNCE.**
==266==Why, as black as ink.

**SPEED.**
==267==Let me read them.

**LAUNCE.**
==268==Fie on thee, jolthead, thou canst not read.

**SPEED.**
==269==Thou liest; I can.

**LAUNCE.**
==270==I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?

**SPEED.**
==271==Marry, the son of my grandfather.

**LAUNCE.**
==272==O illiterate loiterer! It was the son of thy grandmother. This proves that thou canst not read.

**SPEED.**
==273==Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.

**LAUNCE.**
==274==There—and Saint Nicholas be thy speed!

**SPEED.**
*(Reads.)*
==275==*“Imprimis, She can milk.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==276==Ay, that she can.

**SPEED.**
*(Reads.)*
==277==*“Item, She brews good ale.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==278==And thereof comes the proverb: “Blessing of your heart, you brew good ale.”

**SPEED.**
==279==*“Item, She can sew.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==280==That’s as much as to say, “Can she so?”

**SPEED.**
==281==*“Item, She can knit.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==282==What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when she can knit him a stock?

**SPEED.**
==283==*“Item, She can wash and scour.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==284==A special virtue; for then she need not be wash’d and scour’d.

**SPEED.**
==285==*“Item, She can spin.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==286==Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can spin for her living.

**SPEED.**
==287==*“Item, She hath many nameless virtues.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==288==That’s as much as to say “bastard virtues,” that indeed know not their fathers, and therefore have no names.

**SPEED.**
==289==Here follow her vices.

**LAUNCE.**
==290==Close at the heels of her virtues.

**SPEED.**
==291==*“Item, She is not to be kiss’d fasting, in respect of her breath.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==292==Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.

**SPEED.**
==293==*“Item, She hath a sweet mouth.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==294==That makes amends for her sour breath.

**SPEED.**
==295==*“Item, She doth talk in her sleep.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==296==It’s no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.

**SPEED.**
==297==*“Item, She is slow in words.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==298==O villain, that set this down among her vices! To be slow in words is a woman’s only virtue. I pray thee out with’t, and place it for her chief virtue.

**SPEED.**
==299==*“Item, She is proud.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==300==Out with that too; it was Eve’s legacy, and cannot be ta’en from her.

**SPEED.**
==301==*“Item, She hath no teeth.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==302==I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.

**SPEED.**
==303==*“Item, She is curst.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==304==Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.

**SPEED.**
==305==*“Item, She will often praise her liquor.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==306==If her liquor be good, she shall; if she will not, I will; for good things should be prais’d.

**SPEED.**
==307==*“Item, She is too liberal.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==308==Of her tongue she cannot, for that’s writ down she is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that I’ll keep shut. Now, of another thing she may, and that cannot I help. Well, proceed.

**SPEED.**
==309==*“Item, She hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==310==Stop there; I’ll have her. She was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article. Rehearse that once more.

**SPEED.**
==311==*“Item, She hath more hair than wit”—*

**LAUNCE.**
==312==More hair than wit? It may be; I’ll prove it: the cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit, for the greater hides the less. What’s next?

**SPEED.**
==313==*“And more faults than hairs”—*

**LAUNCE.**
==314==That’s monstrous. O that that were out!

**SPEED.**
==315==*“And more wealth than faults.”*

**LAUNCE.**
==316==Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well, I’ll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is impossible⁠—

**SPEED.**
==317==What then?

**LAUNCE.**
==318==Why, then will I tell thee—that thy master stays for thee at the North-gate.

**SPEED.**
==319==For me?

**LAUNCE.**
==320==For thee? Ay, who art thou? He hath stay’d for a better man than thee.

**SPEED.**
==321==And must I go to him?

**LAUNCE.**
==322==Thou must run to him, for thou hast stay’d so long that going will scarce serve the turn.

**SPEED.**
==323==Why didst not tell me sooner? Pox of your love-letters!

*Exit.*

**LAUNCE.**
==324==Now will he be swing’d for reading my letter—an unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into secrets. I’ll after, to rejoice in the boy’s correction.

*Exit.*
