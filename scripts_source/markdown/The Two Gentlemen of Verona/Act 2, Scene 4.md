## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Milan. A room in the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Valentine, Silvia, Thurio, Speed.*

**SILV.**
==1==Servant!

**VAL.**
==2==Mistress?

**SPEED.**
==3==Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.

**VAL.**
==4==Ay, boy, it’s for love.

**SPEED.**
==5==Not of you.

**VAL.**
==6==Of my mistress then.

**SPEED.**
==7==’Twere good you knock’d him.

*Exit.*

**SILV.**
==8==Servant, you are sad.

**VAL.**
==9==Indeed, madam, I seem so.

**THU.**
==10==Seem you that you are not?

**VAL.**
==11==Happ’ly I do.

**THU.**
==12==So do counterfeits.

**VAL.**
==13==So do you.

**THU.**
==14==What seem I that I am not?

**VAL.**
==15==Wise.

**THU.**
==16==What instance of the contrary?

**VAL.**
==17==Your folly.

**THU.**
==18==And how quote you my folly?

**VAL.**
==19==I quote it in your jerkin.

**THU.**
==20==My jerkin is a doublet.

**VAL.**
==21==Well then I’ll double your folly.

**THU.**
==22==How?

**SILV.**
==23==What, angry, Sir Thurio? Do you change color?

**VAL.**
==24==Give him leave, madam, he is a kind of chameleon.

**THU.**
==25==That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air.

**VAL.**
==26==You have said, sir.

**THU.**
==27==Ay, sir, and done too—for this time.

**VAL.**
==28==I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.

**SILV.**
==29==A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.

**VAL.**
==30==’Tis indeed, madam, we thank the giver.

**SILV.**
==31==Who is that, servant?

**VAL.**
==32==Yourself, sweet lady, for you gave the fire. Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship’s looks, and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.

**THU.**
==33==Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt.

**VAL.**
==34==I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words and, I think, no other treasure to give your followers; for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words.

**SILV.**
==35==No more, gentlemen, no more; here comes my father.

*Enter Duke.*

**DUKE.**
==36==Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
==37==Sir Valentine, your father is in good health:
==38==What say you to a letter from your friends
==39==Of much good news?

**VAL.**
==39==           My lord, I will be thankful
==40==To any happy messenger from thence.

**DUKE.**
==41==Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?

**VAL.**
==42==Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
==43==To be of worth and worthy estimation,
==44==And not without desert so well reputed.

**DUKE.**
==45==Hath he not a son?

**VAL.**
==46==Ay, my good lord, a son that well deserves
==47==The honor and regard of such a father.

**DUKE.**
==48==You know him well?

**VAL.**
==49==I knew him as myself: for from our infancy
==50==We have convers’d and spent our hours together,
==51==And though myself have been an idle truant,
==52==Omitting the sweet benefit of time
==53==To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
==54==Yet hath Sir Proteus (for that’s his name) 
==55==Made use and fair advantage of his days;
==56==His years but young, but his experience old;
==57==His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe;
==58==And in a word (for far behind his worth
==59==Comes all the praises that I now bestow),
==60==He is complete in feature and in mind
==61==With all good grace to grace a gentleman.

**DUKE.**
==62==Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
==63==He is as worthy for an empress’ love
==64==As meet to be an emperor’s counsellor.
==65==Well, sir—this gentleman is come to me
==66==With commendation from great potentates,
==67==And here he means to spend his time a while.
==68==I think ’tis no unwelcome news to you.

**VAL.**
==69==Should I have wish’d a thing, it had been he.

**DUKE.**
==70==Welcome him then according to his worth⁠—
==71==Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
==72==For Valentine, I need not cite him to it.
==73==I will send him hither to you presently.

*Exit.*

**VAL.**
==74==This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
==75==Had come along with me, but that his mistress
==76==Did hold his eyes lock’d in her crystal looks.

**SILV.**
==77==Belike that now she hath enfranchis’d them
==78==Upon some other pawn for fealty.

**VAL.**
==79==Nay sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.

**SILV.**
==80==Nay then he should be blind, and being blind,
==81==How could he see his way to seek out you?

**VAL.**
==82==Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.

**THU.**
==83==They say that Love hath not an eye at all.

**VAL.**
==84==To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
==85==Upon a homely object Love can wink.

**SILV.**
==86==Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.

*Exit Thurio.*

*Enter Proteus.*

**VAL.**
==87==Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you
==88==Confirm his welcome with some special favor.

**SILV.**
==89==His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
==90==If this be he you oft have wish’d to hear from.

**VAL.**
==91==Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
==92==To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.

**SILV.**
==93==Too low a mistress for so high a servant.

**PRO.**
==94==Not so, sweet lady, but too mean a servant
==95==To have a look of such a worthy mistress.

**VAL.**
==96==Leave off discourse of disability.
==97==Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.

**PRO.**
==98==My duty will I boast of, nothing else.

**SILV.**
==99==And duty never yet did want his meed.
==100==Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.

**PRO.**
==101==I’ll die on him that says so but yourself.

**SILV.**
==102==That you are welcome?

**PRO.**
==102==              That you are worthless.

*Enter Thurio.*

**THU.**
==103==Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.

**SILV.**
==104==I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
==105==Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome;
==106==I’ll leave you to confer of home affairs;
==107==When you have done, we look to hear from you.

**PRO.**
==108==We’ll both attend upon your ladyship.

*Exeunt Silvia and Thurio.*

**VAL.**
==109==Now tell me: how do all from whence you came?

**PRO.**
==110==Your friends are well and have them much commended.

**VAL.**
==111==And how do yours?

**PRO.**
==111==           I left them all in health.

**VAL.**
==112==How does your lady, and how thrives your love?

**PRO.**
==113==My tales of love were wont to weary you;
==114==I know you joy not in a love-discourse.

**VAL.**
==115==Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter’d now:
==116==I have done penance for contemning Love,
==117==Whose high imperious thoughts have punish’d me
==118==With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
==119==With nightly tears, and daily heart-sore sighs,
==120==For in revenge of my contempt of love,
==121==Love hath chas’d sleep from my enthralled eyes,
==122==And made them watchers of mine own heart’s sorrow.
==123==O gentle Proteus, Love’s a mighty lord,
==124==And hath so humbled me as I confess
==125==There is no woe to his correction,
==126==Nor to his service no such joy on earth:
==127==Now no discourse, except it be of love;
==128==Now can I break my fast, dine, sup, and sleep,
==129==Upon the very naked name of love.

**PRO.**
==130==Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
==131==Was this the idol that you worship so?

**VAL.**
==132==Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?

**PRO.**
==133==No; but she is an earthly paragon.

**VAL.**
==134==Call her divine.

**PRO.**
==134==        I will not flatter her.

**VAL.**
==135==O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.

**PRO.**
==136==When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
==137==And I must minister the like to you.

**VAL.**
==138==Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
==139==Yet let her be a principality,
==140==Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.

**PRO.**
==141==Except my mistress.

**VAL.**
==141==           Sweet, except not any,
==142==Except thou wilt except against my love.

**PRO.**
==143==Have I not reason to prefer mine own?

**VAL.**
==144==And I will help thee to prefer her too:
==145==She shall be dignified with this high honor⁠—
==146==To bear my lady’s train, lest the base earth
==147==Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss,
==148==And of so great a favor growing proud,
==149==Disdain to root the summer-swelling flow’r,
==150==And make rough winter everlastingly.

**PRO.**
==151==Why, Valentine, what braggadism is this?

**VAL.**
==152==Pardon me, Proteus, all I can is nothing
==153==To her, whose worth makes other worthies nothing:
==154==She is alone.

**PRO.**
==154==        Then let her alone.

**VAL.**
==155==Not for the world. Why, man, she is mine own,
==156==And I as rich in having such a jewel
==157==As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
==158==The water nectar, and the rocks pure gold.
==159==Forgive me, that I do not dream on thee,
==160==Because thou seest me dote upon my love.
==161==My foolish rival, that her father likes
==162==(Only for his possessions are so huge),
==163==Is gone with her along, and I must after,
==164==For love, thou know’st, is full of jealousy.

**PRO.**
==165==But she loves you?

**VAL.**
==166==Ay, and we are betroth’d: nay more, our marriage hour,
==167==With all the cunning manner of our flight,
==168==Determin’d of—how I must climb her window,
==169==The ladder made of cords, and all the means
==170==Plotted and ’greed on for my happiness.
==171==Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
==172==In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.

**PRO.**
==173==Go on before; I shall inquire you forth.
==174==I must unto the road, to disembark
==175==Some necessaries that I needs must use,
==176==And then I’ll presently attend you.

**VAL.**
==177==Will you make haste?

**PRO.**
==178==I will.
*(Exit Valentine.)*
==179==Even as one heat another heat expels,
==180==Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
==181==So the remembrance of my former love
==182==Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
==183==Is it mine eye, or Valentinus’ praise,
==184==Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
==185==That makes me reasonless, to reason thus?
==186==She is fair; and so is Julia that I love
==187==(That I did love, for now my love is thaw’d,
==188==Which like a waxen image ’gainst a fire
==189==Bears no impression of the thing it was).
==190==Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
==191==And that I love him not as I was wont:
==192==O, but I love his lady too too much,
==193==And that’s the reason I love him so little.
==194==How shall I dote on her with more advice,
==195==That thus without advice begin to love her?
==196==’Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
==197==And that hath dazzled my reason’s light;
==198==But when I look on her perfections,
==199==There is no reason but I shall be blind.
==200==If I can check my erring love, I will;
==201==If not, to compass her I’ll use my skill.

*Exit.*
