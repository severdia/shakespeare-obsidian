## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Milan. An abbey.*

*Enter Eglamour.*

**EGL.**
==1==The sun begins to gild the western sky,
==2==And now it is about the very hour
==3==That Silvia at Friar Patrick’s cell should meet me.
==4==She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
==5==Unless it be to come before their time,
==6==So much they spur their expedition.
==7==See where she comes.
*(Enter Silvia.)*
==7==           Lady, a happy evening!

**SILV.**
==8==Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
==9==Out at the postern by the abbey wall;
==10==I fear I am attended by some spies.

**EGL.**
==11==Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
==12==If we recover that, we are sure enough.

*Exeunt.*
