## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Milan. An abbey.*

*Enter Eglamour.*

**EGL.**
The sun begins to gild the western sky,
And now it is about the very hour
That Silvia at Friar Patrick’s cell should meet me.
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
Unless it be to come before their time,
So much they spur their expedition.
See where she comes.
*(Enter Silvia.)*
           Lady, a happy evening!

**SILV.**
Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
Out at the postern by the abbey wall;
I fear I am attended by some spies.

**EGL.**
Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
If we recover that, we are sure enough.

*Exeunt.*
