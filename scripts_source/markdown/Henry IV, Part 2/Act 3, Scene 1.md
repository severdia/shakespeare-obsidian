## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Westminster. A palace room.*

*Enter the King in his night-gown, alone, followed by a Page.*

**KING.**
==1== Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;
==2== But, ere they come, bid them o’er-read these letters
==3== And well consider of them. Make good speed.
*(Exit Page.)*
==4== How many thousand of my poorest subjects
==5== Are at this hour asleep! O sleep! O gentle sleep!
==6== Nature’s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
==7== That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down,
==8== And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
==9== Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
==10== Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
==11== And hush’d with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
==12== Than in the perfum’d chambers of the great,
==13== Under the canopies of costly state,
==14== And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody?
==15== O thou dull god, why li’st thou with the vile
==16== In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch
==17== A watch-case or a common ’larum-bell?
==18== Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
==19== Seal up the ship-boy’s eyes, and rock his brains
==20== In cradle of the rude imperious surge,
==21== And in the visitation of the winds,
==22== Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
==23== Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
==24== With deafing clamor in the slippery clouds,
==25== That with the hurly death itself awakes?
==26== Canst thou, O partial sleep, give then repose
==27== To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
==28== And in the calmest and most stillest night,
==29== With all appliances and means to boot,
==30== Deny it to a king? Then (happy) low, lie down!
==31== Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

*Enter Warwick, Surrey, and Sir John Blunt.*

**WAR.**
==32== Many good morrows to your Majesty!

**KING.**
==33== Is it good morrow, lords?

**WAR.**
==34== ’Tis one a’ clock, and past.

**KING.**
==35== Why then good morrow to you all, my lords.
==36== Have you read o’er the letters that I sent you?

**WAR.**
==37== We have, my liege.

**KING.**
==38== Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
==39== How foul it is, what rank diseases grow,
==40== And with what danger, near the heart of it.

**WAR.**
==41== It is but as a body yet distempered,
==42== Which to his former strength may be restored
==43== With good advice and little medicine.
==44== My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool’d.

**KING.**
==45== O God, that one might read the book of fate,
==46== And see the revolution of the times
==47== Make mountains level, and the continent,
==48== Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
==49== Into the sea, and other times to see
==50== The beachy girdle of the ocean
==51== Too wide for Neptune’s hips; how chance’s mocks
==52== And changes fill the cup of alteration
==53== With diverse liquors! O, if this were seen,
==54== The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,
==55== What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
==56== Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.
==57== ’Tis not ten years gone
==58== Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
==59== Did feast together, and in two year after
==60== Were they at wars. It is but eight years since
==61== This Percy was the man nearest my soul,
==62== Who like a brother toil’d in my affairs,
==63== And laid his love and life under my foot,
==64== Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
==65== Gave him defiance. But which of you was by⁠—
*(To Warwick.)*
==66== You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember⁠—
==67== When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,
==68== Then check’d and rated by Northumberland,
==69== Did speak these words, now prov’d a prophecy?
==70== “Northumberland, thou ladder by the which
==71== My cousin Bullingbrook ascends my throne”
==72== (Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,
==73== But that necessity so bow’d the state
==74== That I and greatness were compell’d to kiss),
==75== “The time shall come,” thus did he follow it,
==76== “The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,
==77== Shall break into corruption”: so went on,
==78== Foretelling this same time’s condition
==79== And the division of our amity.

**WAR.**
==80== There is a history in all men’s lives,
==81== Figuring the natures of the times deceas’d,
==82== The which observ’d, a man may prophesy,
==83== With a near aim, of the main chance of things
==84== As yet not come to life, who in their seeds
==85== And weak beginning lie intreasured.
==86== Such things become the hatch and brood of time,
==87== And by the necessary form of this
==88== King Richard might create a perfect guess
==89== That great Northumberland, then false to him,
==90== Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness,
==91== Which should not find a ground to root upon
==92== Unless on you.

**KING.**
==92==         Are these things then necessities?
==93== Then let us meet them like necessities;
==94== And that same word even now cries out on us.
==95== They say the Bishop and Northumberland
==96== Are fifty thousand strong.

**WAR.**
==96==               It cannot be, my lord.
==97== Rumor doth double, like the voice and echo,
==98== The numbers of the feared. Please it your Grace
==99== To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,
==100== The powers that you already have sent forth
==101== Shall bring this prize in very easily.
==102== To comfort you the more, I have received
==103== A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
==104== Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill,
==105== And these unseasoned hours perforce must add
==106== Unto your sickness.

**KING.**
==106==            I will take your counsel,
==107== And were these inward wars once out of hand,
==108== We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.

*Exeunt.*
