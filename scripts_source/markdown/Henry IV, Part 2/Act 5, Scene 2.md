## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Westminster. A palace room.*

*Enter Warwick, Lord Chief Justice, meeting.*

**WAR.**
==1==How now, my Lord Chief Justice, whither away?

**CH. JUST.**
==2==How doth the King?

**WAR.**
==3==Exceeding well, his cares are now all ended.

**CH. JUST.**
==4==I hope, not dead.

**WAR.**
==4==        He’s walk’d the way of nature,
==5==And to our purposes he lives no more.

**CH. JUST.**
==6==I would his Majesty had call’d me with him;
==7==The service that I truly did his life
==8==Hath left me open to all injuries.

**WAR.**
==9==Indeed I think the young King loves you not.

**CH. JUST.**
==10==I know he doth not, and do arm myself
==11==To welcome the condition of the time,
==12==Which cannot look more hideously upon me
==13==Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.

*Enter Prince John of Lancaster, Thomas of Clarence, and Humphrey of Gloucester, Westmorland, and others.*

**WAR.**
==14==Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry.
==15==O that the living Harry had the temper
==16==Of he, the worst of these three gentlemen!
==17==How many nobles then should hold their places,
==18==That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!

**CH. JUST.**
==19==O God, I fear all will be overturn’d!

**P. JOHN.**
==20==Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.

**GLOU. AND CLAR.**
==21==Good morrow, cousin.

**P. JOHN.**
==22==We meet like men that had forgot to speak.

**WAR.**
==23==We do remember, but our argument
==24==Is all too heavy to admit much talk.

**P. JOHN.**
==25==Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy!

**CH. JUST.**
==26==Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!

**GLOU.**
==27==O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed,
==28==And I dare swear you borrow not that face
==29==Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.

**P. JOHN.**
==30==Though no man be assur’d what grace to find,
==31==You stand in coldest expectation.
==32==I am the sorrier, would ’twere otherwise!

**CLAR.**
==33==Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair,
==34==Which swims against your stream of quality.

**CH. JUST.**
==35==Sweet Princes, what I did, I did in honor,
==36==Led by th’ impartial conduct of my soul;
==37==And never shall you see that I will beg
==38==A ragged and forestall’d remission.
==39==If truth and upright innocency fail me,
==40==I’ll to the King my master that is dead,
==41==And tell him who hath sent me after him.

**WAR.**
==42==Here comes the Prince.

*Enter the Prince (as King Henry) and Blunt.*

**CH. JUST.**
==43==Good morrow, and God save your Majesty!

**PRINCE.**
==44==This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,
==45==Sits not so easy on me as you think.
==46==Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:
==47==This is the English, not the Turkish court,
==48==Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
==49==But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,
==50==For by my faith it very well becomes you.
==51==Sorrow so royally in you appears
==52==That I will deeply put the fashion on
==53==And wear it in my heart. Why then be sad,
==54==But entertain no more of it, good brothers,
==55==Than a joint burden laid upon us all.
==56==For me, by heaven (I bid you be assur’d),
==57==I’ll be your father and your brother too.
==58==Let me but bear your love, I’ll bear your cares.
==59==Yet weep that Harry’s dead, and so will I,
==60==But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears
==61==By number into hours of happiness.

**PRINCES.**
==62==We hope no otherwise from your Majesty.

**PRINCE.**
==63==You all look strangely on me, and you most.
==64==You are, I think, assur’d I love you not.

**CH. JUST.**
==65==I am assur’d, if I be measur’d rightly,
==66==Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me.

**PRINCE.**
==67==No?
==68==How might a prince of my great hopes forget
==69==So great indignities you laid upon me?
==70==What, rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison
==71==Th’ immediate heir of England! Was this easy?
==72==May this be wash’d in Lethe and forgotten?

**CH. JUST.**
==73==I then did use the person of your father,
==74==The image of his power lay then in me,
==75==And in th’ administration of his law,
==76==Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
==77==Your Highness pleased to forget my place,
==78==The majesty and power of law and justice,
==79==The image of the King whom I presented,
==80==And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
==81==Whereon (as an offender to your father) 
==82==I gave bold way to my authority,
==83==And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
==84==Be you contented, wearing now the garland,
==85==To have a son set your decrees at nought?
==86==To pluck down justice from your awful bench?
==87==To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
==88==That guards the peace and safety of your person?
==89==Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image,
==90==And mock your workings in a second body?
==91==Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours:
==92==Be now the father and propose a son,
==93==Hear your own dignity so much profan’d,
==94==See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
==95==Behold yourself so by a son disdained;
==96==And then imagine me taking your part,
==97==And in your power soft silencing your son.
==98==After this cold considerance, sentence me,
==99==And as you are a king, speak in your state
==100==What I have done that misbecame my place,
==101==My person, or my liege’s sovereignty.

**PRINCE.**
==102==You are right justice, and you weigh this well,
==103==Therefore still bear the balance and the sword,
==104==And I do wish your honors may increase,
==105==Till you do live to see a son of mine
==106==Offend you and obey you, as I did.
==107==So shall I live to speak my father’s words:
==108==“Happy am I, that have a man so bold,
==109==That dares do justice on my proper son;
==110==And not less happy, having such a son
==111==That would deliver up his greatness so
==112==Into the hands of justice.” You did commit me;
==113==For which I do commit into your hand
==114==Th’ unstained sword that you have us’d to bear,
==115==With this remembrance, that you use the same
==116==With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit
==117==As you have done ’gainst me. There is my hand.
==118==You shall be as a father to my youth,
==119==My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,
==120==And I will stoop and humble my intents
==121==To your well-practic’d wise directions.
==122==And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you,
==123==My father is gone wild into his grave;
==124==For in his tomb lie my affections,
==125==And with his spirits sadly I survive,
==126==To mock the expectation of the world,
==127==To frustrate prophecies, and to rase out
==128==Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
==129==After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
==130==Hath proudly flow’d in vanity till now;
==131==Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
==132==Where it shall mingle with the state of floods,
==133==And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
==134==Now call we our high court of parliament,
==135==And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel
==136==That the great body of our state may go
==137==In equal rank with the best govern’d nation,
==138==That war, or peace, or both at once, may be
==139==As things acquainted and familiar to us,
==140==In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.
==141==Our coronation done, we will accite
==142==(As I before rememb’red) all our state,
==143==And (God consigning to my good intents) 
==144==No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
==145==God shorten Harry’s happy life one day!

*Exeunt.*
