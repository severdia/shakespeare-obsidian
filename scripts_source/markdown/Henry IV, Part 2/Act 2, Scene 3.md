## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Warkworth. Before Northumberland’s castle.*

*Enter Northumberland (Henry Percy), his wife, Lady Northumberland, and Lady Percy, the wife to Harry Percy.*

**NORTH.**
==1==I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,
==2==Give even way unto my rough affairs;
==3==Put not you on the visage of the times,
==4==And be like them to Percy troublesome.

**L. NORTH.**
==5==I have given over, I will speak no more;
==6==Do what you will, your wisdom be your guide.

**NORTH.**
==7==Alas, sweet wife, my honor is at pawn,
==8==And but my going, nothing can redeem it.

**LADY P.**
==9==O yet for God’s sake, go not to these wars!
==10==The time was, father, that you broke your word
==11==When you were more endear’d to it than now,
==12==When your own Percy, when my heart’s dear Harry,
==13==Threw many a northward look to see his father
==14==Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
==15==Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
==16==There were two honors lost, yours and your son’s:
==17==For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!
==18==For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
==19==In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light
==20==Did all the chivalry of England move
==21==To do brave acts. He was indeed the glass
==22==Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:
==23==He had no legs that practic’d not his gait;
==24==And speaking thick (which nature made his blemish) 
==25==Became the accents of the valiant;
==26==For those that could speak low and tardily
==27==Would turn their own perfection to abuse
==28==To seem like him; so that in speech, in gait,
==29==In diet, in affections of delight,
==30==In military rules, humors of blood,
==31==He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
==32==That fashion’d others. And him, O wondrous him!
==33==O miracle of men! Him did you leave,
==34==Second to none, unseconded by you,
==35==To look upon the hideous god of war
==36==In disadvantage, to abide a field
==37==Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur’s name
==38==Did seem defensible: so you left him.
==39==Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
==40==To hold your honor more precise and nice
==41==With others than with him! Let them alone.
==42==The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong.
==43==Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,
==44==Today might I, hanging on Hotspur’s neck,
==45==Have talk’d of Monmouth’s grave.

**NORTH.**
==45==                  Beshrew your heart,
==46==Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me
==47==With new lamenting ancient oversights,
==48==But I must go and meet with danger there,
==49==Or it will seek me in another place,
==50==And find me worse provided.

**L. NORTH.**
==50==                O, fly to Scotland,
==51==Till that the nobles and the armed commons
==52==Have of their puissance made a little taste.

**LADY P.**
==53==If they get ground and vantage of the King,
==54==Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,
==55==To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,
==56==First let them try themselves. So did your son,
==57==He was so suff’red; so came I a widow,
==58==And never shall have length of life enough
==59==To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,
==60==That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,
==61==For recordation to my noble husband.

**NORTH.**
==62==Come, come, go in with me. ’Tis with my mind
==63==As with the tide swell’d up unto his height,
==64==That makes a still-stand, running neither way.
==65==Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop,
==66==But many thousand reasons hold me back.
==67==I will resolve for Scotland; there am I,
==68==Till time and vantage crave my company.

*Exeunt.*
