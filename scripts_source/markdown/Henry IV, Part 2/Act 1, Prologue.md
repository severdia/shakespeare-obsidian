## Act 1, Prologue

*Induction*


*Enter Rumor, painted full of tongues.*

**RUM.**
==1==Open your ears; for which of you will stop
==2==The vent of hearing when loud Rumor speaks?
==3==I, from the orient to the drooping west
==4==(Making the wind my post-horse), still unfold
==5==The acts commenced on this ball of earth.
==6==Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
==7==The which in every language I pronounce,
==8==Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
==9==I speak of peace, while covert enmity
==10==Under the smile of safety wounds the world;
==11==And who but Rumor, who but only I,
==12==Make fearful musters and prepar’d defense,
==13==Whiles the big year, swoll’n with some other grief,
==14==Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
==15==And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe
==16==Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,
==17==And of so easy and so plain a stop
==18==That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
==19==The still-discordant wav’ring multitude,
==20==Can play upon it. But what need I thus
==21==My well-known body to anatomize
==22==Among my household? Why is Rumor here?
==23==I run before King Harry’s victory,
==24==Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
==25==Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
==26==Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
==27==Even with the rebels’ blood. But what mean I
==28==To speak so true at first? My office is
==29==To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
==30==Under the wrath of noble Hotspur’s sword,
==31==And that the King before the Douglas’ rage
==32==Stoop’d his anointed head as low as death.
==33==This have I rumor’d through the peasant towns
==34==Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
==35==And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
==36==Where Hotspur’s father, old Northumberland,
==37==Lies crafty-sick. The posts come tiring on,
==38==And not a man of them brings other news
==39==Than they have learnt of me. From Rumor’s tongues
==40==They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.


*Exit Rumor.*
