## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Yorkshire. Within the Forest of Gaultree.*

*Enter the Archbishop of York, Mowbray, Lord Bardolph, Hastings, and others, within the forest of Gaultree.*

**ARCH.**
==1==What is this forest call’d?

**HAST.**
==2==’Tis Gaultree forest, and’t shall please your Grace.

**ARCH.**
==3==Here stand, my lords, and send discoverers forth
==4==To know the numbers of our enemies.

**HAST.**
==5==We have sent forth already.

**ARCH.**
==5==              ’Tis well done.
==6==My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
==7==I must acquaint you that I have receiv’d
==8==New-dated letters from Northumberland,
==9==Their cold intent, tenure, and substance thus:
==10==Here doth he wish his person, with such powers
==11==As might hold sortance with his quality,
==12==The which he could not levy; whereupon
==13==He is retir’d, to ripe his growing fortunes,
==14==To Scotland, and concludes in hearty prayers
==15==That your attempts may overlive the hazard
==16==And fearful meeting of their opposite.

**MOWB.**
==17==Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
==18==And dash themselves to pieces.

*Enter Messenger.*

**HAST.**
==18==                  Now, what news?

**MESS.**
==19==West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
==20==In goodly form comes on the enemy,
==21==And by the ground they hide, I judge their number
==22==Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.

**MOWB.**
==23==The just proportion that we gave them out.
==24==Let us sway on and face them in the field.

**ARCH.**
==25==What well-appointed leader fronts us here?

*Enter Westmorland.*

**MOWB.**
==26==I think it is my Lord of Westmorland.

**WEST.**
==27==Health and fair greeting from our general,
==28==The Prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.

**ARCH.**
==29==Say on, my Lord of Westmorland, in peace,
==30==What doth concern your coming.

**WEST.**
==30==                  Then, my lord,
==31==Unto your Grace do I in chief address
==32==The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
==33==Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
==34==Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage,
==35==And countenanc’d by boys and beggary⁠—
==36==I say, if damn’d commotion so appear’d
==37==In his true, native, and most proper shape,
==38==You, reverend father, and these noble lords
==39==Had not been here to dress the ugly form
==40==Of base and bloody insurrection
==41==With your fair honors. You, Lord Archbishop,
==42==Whose see is by a civil peace maintain’d,
==43==Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch’d,
==44==Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor’d,
==45==Whose white investments figure innocence,
==46==The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace,
==47==Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself
==48==Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,
==49==Into the harsh and boist’rous tongue of war?
==50==Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,
==51==Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine
==52==To a loud trumpet and a point of war?

**ARCH.**
==53==Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.
==54==Briefly, to this end: we are all diseas’d,
==55==And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
==56==Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
==57==And we must bleed for it; of which disease
==58==Our late King Richard (being infected) died.
==59==But, my most noble Lord of Westmorland,
==60==I take not on me here as a physician,
==61==Nor do I as an enemy to peace
==62==Troop in the throngs of military men;
==63==But rather show a while like fearful war
==64==To diet rank minds sick of happiness,
==65==And purge th’ obstructions which begin to stop
==66==Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
==67==I have in equal balance justly weigh’d
==68==What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
==69==And find our griefs heavier than our offenses.
==70==We see which way the stream of time doth run,
==71==And are enforc’d from our most quiet there
==72==By the rough torrent of occasion,
==73==And have the summary of all our griefs
==74==(When time shall serve) to show in articles;
==75==Which long ere this we offer’d to the King,
==76==And might by no suit gain our audience.
==77==When we are wrong’d and would unfold our griefs,
==78==We are denied access unto his person
==79==Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
==80==The dangers of the days but newly gone,
==81==Whose memory is written on the earth
==82==With yet appearing blood, and the examples
==83==Of every minute’s instance (present now) 
==84==Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,
==85==Not to break peace, or any branch of it,
==86==But to establish here a peace indeed,
==87==Concurring both in name and quality.

**WEST.**
==88==When ever yet was your appeal denied?
==89==Wherein have you been galled by the King?
==90==What peer hath been suborn’d to grate on you?
==91==That you should seal this lawless bloody book
==92==Of forg’d rebellion with a seal divine.

**ARCH.**
==93==My brother general, the commonwealth,
==94==I make my quarrel in particular.

**WEST.**
==95==There is no need of any such redress,
==96==Or if there were, it not belongs to you.

**MOWB.**
==97==Why not to him in part, and to us all
==98==That feel the bruises of the days before,
==99==And suffer the condition of these times
==100==To lay a heavy and unequal hand
==101==Upon our honors?

**WEST.**
==101==           O, my good Lord Mowbray,
==102==Construe the times to their necessities,
==103==And you shall say, indeed, it is the time,
==104==And not the King, that doth you injuries.
==105==Yet, for your part, it not appears to me,
==106==Either from the King or in the present time,
==107==That you should have an inch of any ground
==108==To build a grief on. Were you not restor’d
==109==To all the Duke of Norfolk’s signories,
==110==Your noble and right well-rememb’red father’s?

**MOWB.**
==111==What thing, in honor, had my father lost,
==112==That need to be reviv’d and breath’d in me?
==113==The King that lov’d him, as the state stood then,
==114==Was force perforce compell’d to banish him;
==115==And then that Henry Bullingbrook and he,
==116==Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
==117==Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
==118==Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
==119==Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,
==120==And the loud trumpet blowing them together;
==121==Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay’d
==122==My father from the breast of Bullingbrook,
==123==O, when the King did throw his warder down
==124==(His own life hung upon the staff he threw),
==125==Then threw he down himself and all their lives
==126==That by indictment and by dint of sword
==127==Have since miscarried under Bullingbrook.

**WEST.**
==128==You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
==129==The Earl of Herford was reputed then
==130==In England the most valiant gentleman.
==131==Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil’d?
==132==But if your father had been victor there,
==133==He ne’er had borne it out of Coventry;
==134==For all the country in a general voice
==135==Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
==136==Were set on Herford, whom they doted on
==137==And bless’d and grac’d and did, more than the King⁠—
==138==But this is mere digression from my purpose.
==139==Here come I from our princely general
==140==To know your griefs, to tell you from his Grace
==141==That he will give you audience, and wherein
==142==It shall appear that your demands are just,
==143==You shall enjoy them, every thing set off
==144==That might so much as think you enemies.

**MOWB.**
==145==But he hath forc’d us to compel this offer,
==146==And it proceeds from policy, not love.

**WEST.**
==147==Mowbray, you overween to take it so;
==148==This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.
==149==For lo, within a ken our army lies:
==150==Upon mine honor, all too confident
==151==To give admittance to a thought of fear.
==152==Our battle is more full of names than yours,
==153==Our men more perfect in the use of arms,
==154==Our armor all as strong, our cause the best;
==155==Then reason will our hearts should be as good.
==156==Say you not then our offer is compell’d.

**MOWB.**
==157==Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.

**WEST.**
==158==That argues but the shame of your offense:
==159==A rotten case abides no handling.

**HAST.**
==160==Hath the Prince John a full commission,
==161==In very ample virtue of his father,
==162==To hear and absolutely to determine
==163==Of what conditions we shall stand upon?

**WEST.**
==164==That is intended in the general’s name.
==165==I muse you make so slight a question.

**ARCH.**
==166==Then take, my Lord of Westmorland, this schedule,
==167==For this contains our general grievances:
==168==Each several article herein redress’d,
==169==All members of our cause, both here and hence,
==170==That are ensinewed to this action
==171==Acquitted by a true substantial form
==172==And present execution of our wills⁠—
==173==To us and to our purposes confin’d
==174==We come within our awful banks again,
==175==And knit our powers to the arm of peace.

**WEST.**
==176==This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
==177==In sight of both our battles we may meet,
==178==And either end in peace, which God so frame!
==179==Or to the place of diff’rence call the swords
==180==Which must decide it.

**ARCH.**
==180==           My lord, we will do so.

*Exit Westmorland.*

**MOWB.**
==181==There is a thing within my bosom tells me
==182==That no conditions of our peace can stand.

**HAST.**
==183==Fear you not that; if we can make our peace
==184==Upon such large terms and so absolute
==185==As our conditions shall consist upon,
==186==Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.

**MOWB.**
==187==Yea, but our valuation shall be such
==188==That every slight and false-derived cause,
==189==Yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason,
==190==Shall to the King taste of this action,
==191==That were our royal faiths martyrs in love,
==192==We shall be winnow’d with so rough a wind
==193==That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff,
==194==And good from bad find no partition.

**ARCH.**
==195==No, no, my lord, note this: the King is weary
==196==Of dainty and such picking grievances,
==197==For he hath found to end one doubt by death
==198==Revives two greater in the heirs of life;
==199==And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
==200==And keep no tell-tale to his memory
==201==That may repeat and history his loss
==202==To new remembrance; for full well he knows
==203==He cannot so precisely weed this land
==204==As his misdoubts present occasion.
==205==His foes are so enrooted with his friends
==206==That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
==207==He doth unfasten so and shake a friend,
==208==So that this land, like an offensive wife
==209==That hath enrag’d him on to offer strokes,
==210==As he is striking, holds his infant up
==211==And hangs resolv’d correction in the arm
==212==That was uprear’d to execution.

**HAST.**
==213==Besides, the King hath wasted all his rods
==214==On late offenders, that he now doth lack
==215==The very instruments of chastisement,
==216==So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
==217==May offer, but not hold.

**ARCH.**
==217==              ’Tis very true,
==218==And therefore be assur’d, my good Lord Marshal,
==219==If we do now make our atonement well,
==220==Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
==221==Grow stronger for the breaking.

**MOWB.**
==221==                  Be it so.
==222==Here is return’d my Lord of Westmorland.

*Enter Westmorland.*

**WEST.**
==223==The Prince is here at hand. Pleaseth your lordship
==224==To meet his Grace just distance ’tween our armies.

**MOWB.**
==225==Your Grace of York, in God’s name then set forward.

**ARCH.**
==226==Before, and greet his Grace.—My lord, we come.

*They march about the stage and then move forward to meet Prince John.*
