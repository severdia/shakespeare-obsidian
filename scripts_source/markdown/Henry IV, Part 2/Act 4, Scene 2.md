## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Yorkshire. Another part of the Forest of Gaultree.*

*Enter Prince John of Lancaster and his army.*

**P. JOHN.**
==1==You are well encount’red here, my cousin Mowbray,
==2==Good day to you, gentle Lord Archbishop,
==3==And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
==4==My Lord of York, it better show’d with you
==5==When that your flock, assembled by the bell,
==6==Encircled you to hear with reverence
==7==Your exposition on the holy text
==8==Than now to see you here an iron man, talking,
==9==Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
==10==Turning the word to sword and life to death.
==11==That man that sits within a monarch’s heart
==12==And ripens in the sunshine of his favor,
==13==Would he abuse the countenance of the King,
==14==Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach
==15==In shadow of such greatness? With you, Lord Bishop,
==16==It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
==17==How deep you were within the books of God?
==18==To us the speaker in his parliament,
==19==To us th’ imagin’d voice of God himself,
==20==The very opener and intelligencer
==21==Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,
==22==And our dull workings? O, who shall believe
==23==But you misuse the reverence of your place,
==24==Employ the countenance and grace of heav’n,
==25==As a false favorite doth his prince’s name,
==26==In deeds dishonorable? You have ta’en up,
==27==Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
==28==The subjects of his substitute, my father,
==29==And both against the peace of heaven and him
==30==Have here upswarm’d them.

**ARCH.**
==30==              Good my Lord of Lancaster,
==31==I am not here against your father’s peace,
==32==But as I told my Lord of Westmorland,
==33==The time misord’red doth, in common sense,
==34==Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form
==35==To hold our safety up. I sent your Grace
==36==The parcels and particulars of our grief,
==37==The which hath been with scorn shov’d from the court,
==38==Whereon this Hydra son of war is born,
==39==Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm’d asleep
==40==With grant of our most just and right desires,
==41==And true obedience, of this madness cured,
==42==Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.

**MOWB.**
==43==If not, we ready are to try our fortunes
==44==To the last man.

**HAST.**
==44==        And though we here fall down,
==45==We have supplies to second our attempt;
==46==If they miscarry, theirs shall second them,
==47==And so success of mischief shall be born,
==48==And heir from heir shall hold his quarrel up
==49==Whiles England shall have generation.

**P. JOHN.**
==50==You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,
==51==To sound the bottom of the after-times.

**WEST.**
==52==Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly
==53==How far forth you do like their articles.

**P. JOHN.**
==54==I like them all, and do allow them well,
==55==And swear here, by the honor of my blood,
==56==My father’s purposes have been mistook,
==57==And some about him have too lavishly
==58==Wrested his meaning and authority.
==59==My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress’d,
==60==Upon my soul they shall. If this may please you,
==61==Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
==62==As we will ours, and here between the armies
==63==Let’s drink together friendly and embrace,
==64==That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
==65==Of our restored love and amity.

**ARCH.**
==66==I take your princely word for these redresses.

**P. JOHN.**
==67==I give it you, and will maintain my word,
==68==And thereupon I drink unto your Grace.

**HAST.**
==69==Go, captain, and deliver to the army
==70==This news of peace. Let them have pay, and part.
==71==I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.

*Exit Officer.*

**ARCH.**
==72==To you, my noble Lord of Westmorland.

**WEST.**
==73==I pledge your Grace, and if you knew what pains
==74==I have bestowed to breed this present peace,
==75==You would drink freely. But my love to ye
==76==Shall show itself more openly hereafter.

**ARCH.**
==77==I do not doubt you.

**WEST.**
==77==           I am glad of it.
==78==Health to my lord, and gentle cousin, Mowbray.

**MOWB.**
==79==You wish me health in very happy season,
==80==For I am on the sudden something ill.

**ARCH.**
==81==Against ill chances men are ever merry,
==82==But heaviness foreruns the good event.

**WEST.**
==83==Therefore be merry, coz, since sudden sorrow
==84==Serves to say thus, some good thing comes tomorrow.

**ARCH.**
==85==Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.

**MOWB.**
==86==So much the worse, if your own rule be true.

*Shout within.*

**P. JOHN.**
==87==The word of peace is rend’red. Hark how they shout!

**MOWB.**
==88==This had been cheerful after victory.

**ARCH.**
==89==A peace is of the nature of a conquest,
==90==For then both parties nobly are subdued,
==91==And neither party loser.

**P. JOHN.**
==91==              Go, my lord,
==92==And let our army be discharged too.
*(Exit Westmorland.)*
==93==And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains
==94==March by us, that we may peruse the men
==95==We should have cop’d withal.

**ARCH.**
==95==                Go, good Lord Hastings,
==96==And ere they be dismiss’d, let them march by.

*Exit Hastings.*

*Enter Westmorland.*

**P. JOHN.**
==97==I trust, lords, we shall lie tonight together.
==98==Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?

**WEST.**
==99==The leaders, having charge from you to stand,
==100==Will not go off until they hear you speak.

**P. JOHN.**
==101==They know their duties.

*Enter Hastings.*

**HAST.**
==102==My lord, our army is dispers’d already:
==103==Like youthful steers unyok’d, they take their courses
==104==East, west, north, south, or, like a school broke up,
==105==Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.

**WEST.**
==106==Good tidings, my Lord Hastings! For the which
==107==I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason,
==108==And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,
==109==Of capital treason I attach you both.

**MOWB.**
==110==Is this proceeding just and honorable?

**WEST.**
==111==Is your assembly so?

**ARCH.**
==112==Will you thus break your faith?

**P. JOHN.**
==112==                I pawn’d thee none.
==113==I promis’d you redress of these same grievances
==114==Whereof you did complain, which, by mine honor,
==115==I will perform with a most Christian care.
==116==But for you rebels, look to taste the due
==117==Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.
==118==Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
==119==Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.
==120==Strike up our drums, pursue the scatt’red stray;
==121==God, and not we, hath safely fought today.
==122==Some guard these traitors to the block of death,
==123==Treason’s true bed and yielder-up of breath.

*Exeunt.*
