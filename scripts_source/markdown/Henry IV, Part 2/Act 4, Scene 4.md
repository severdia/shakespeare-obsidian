## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Jerusalem Chamber in Westminster.*

*Enter the King, carried in a chair, Warwick, Thomas Duke of Clarence, Humphrey of Gloucester, and others.*

**KING.**
==1==Now, lords, if God doth give successful end
==2==To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,
==3==We will our youth lead on to higher fields,
==4==And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
==5==Our navy is address’d, our power collected,
==6==Our substitutes in absence well invested,
==7==And every thing lies level to our wish.
==8==Only, we want a little personal strength;
==9==And pause us till these rebels, now afoot,
==10==Come underneath the yoke of government.

**WAR.**
==11==Both which we doubt not but your Majesty
==12==Shall soon enjoy.

**KING.**
==12==        Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,
==13==Where is the Prince your brother?

**GLOU.**
==14==I think he’s gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.

**KING.**
==15==And how accompanied?

**GLOU.**
==15==              I do not know, my lord.

**KING.**
==16==Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him?

**GLOU.**
==17==No, my good lord, he is in presence here.

**CLAR.**
==18==What would my lord and father?

**KING.**
==19==Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
==20==How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?
==21==He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.
==22==Thou hast a better place in his affection
==23==Than all thy brothers. Cherish it, my boy;
==24==And noble offices thou mayst effect
==25==Of mediation, after I am dead,
==26==Between his greatness and thy other brethren.
==27==Therefore omit him not, blunt not his love,
==28==Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
==29==By seeming cold or careless of his will,
==30==For he is gracious if he be observ’d,
==31==He hath a tear for pity, and a hand
==32==Open as day for meting charity;
==33==Yet notwithstanding, being incens’d, he is flint,
==34==As humorous as winter, and as sudden
==35==As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
==36==His temper therefore must be well observ’d.
==37==Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,
==38==When you perceive his blood inclin’d to mirth;
==39==But, being moody, give him time and scope,
==40==Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
==41==Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
==42==And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
==43==A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
==44==That the united vessel of their blood,
==45==Mingled with venom of suggestion
==46==(As, force perforce, the age will pour it in),
==47==Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
==48==As aconitum or rash gunpowder.

**CLAR.**
==49==I shall observe him with all care and love.

**KING.**
==50==Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?

**CLAR.**
==51==He is not there today, he dines in London.

**KING.**
==52==And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that?

**CLAR.**
==53==With Poins, and other his continual followers.

**KING.**
==54==Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds,
==55==And he, the noble image of my youth,
==56==Is overspread with them; therefore my grief
==57==Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.
==58==The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,
==59==In forms imaginary, th’ unguided days
==60==And rotten times that you shall look upon,
==61==When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
==62==For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
==63==When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,
==64==When means and lavish manners meet together,
==65==O, with what wings shall his affections fly
==66==Towards fronting peril and oppos’d decay!

**WAR.**
==67==My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:
==68==The Prince but studies his companions
==69==Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
==70==’Tis needful that the most immodest word
==71==Be look’d upon and learnt, which once attain’d,
==72==Your Highness knows, comes to no further use
==73==But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
==74==The Prince will in the perfectness of time
==75==Cast off his followers, and their memory
==76==Shall as a pattern or a measure live,
==77==By which his Grace must mete the lives of other,
==78==Turning past evils to advantages.

**KING.**
==79==’Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
==80==In the dead carrion.
*(Enter Westmorland.)*
==80==           Who’s here? Westmorland?

**WEST.**
==81==Health to my sovereign, and new happiness
==82==Added to that that I am to deliver!
==83==Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace’s hand.
==84==Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings, and all,
==85==Are brought to the correction of your law.
==86==There is not now a rebel’s sword unsheath’d,
==87==But Peace puts forth her olive every where.
==88==The manner how this action hath been borne
==89==Here at more leisure may your Highness read,
==90==With every course in his particular.

**KING.**
==91==O Westmorland, thou art a summer bird,
==92==Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
==93==The lifting up of day.
*(Enter Harcourt.)*
==93==           Look here’s more news.

**HAR.**
==94==From enemies heavens keep your Majesty,
==95==And, when they stand against you, may they fall
==96==As those that I am come to tell you of!
==97==The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,
==98==With a great power of English and of Scots,
==99==Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown.
==100==The manner and true order of the fight
==101==This packet, please it you, contains at large.

**KING.**
==102==And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
==103==Will Fortune never come with both hands full,
==104==But write her fair words still in foulest terms?
==105==She either gives a stomach and no food⁠—
==106==Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast
==107==And takes away the stomach—such are the rich,
==108==That have abundance and enjoy it not.
==109==I should rejoice now at this happy news,
==110==And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy.
==111==O me! Come near me, now I am much ill.

**GLOU.**
==112==Comfort, your Majesty!

**CLAR.**
==112==              O my royal father!

**WEST.**
==113==My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.

**WAR.**
==114==Be patient, Princes, you do know these fits
==115==Are with his Highness very ordinary.
==116==Stand from him, give him air, he’ll straight be well.

**CLAR.**
==117==No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs.
==118==Th’ incessant care and labor of his mind
==119==Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
==120==So thin that life looks through and will break out.

**GLOU.**
==121==The people fear me, for they do observe
==122==Unfather’d heirs and loathly births of nature.
==123==The seasons change their manners, as the year
==124==Had found some months asleep and leapt them over.

**CLAR.**
==125==The river hath thrice flowed, no ebb between,
==126==And the old folk (time’s doting chronicles) 
==127==Say it did so a little time before
==128==That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick’d and died.

**WAR.**
==129==Speak lower, Princes, for the King recovers.

**GLOU.**
==130==This apoplexy will certain be his end.

**KING.**
==131==I pray you take me up, and bear me hence
==132==Into some other chamber. Softly, pray.

*The King is carried to one side of the stage and placed on a bed.*
