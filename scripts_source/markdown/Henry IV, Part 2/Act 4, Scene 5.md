## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber.*

**KING.**
==1==Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends,
==2==Unless some dull and favorable hand
==3==Will whisper music to my weary spirit.

**WAR.**
==4==Call for the music in the other room.

**KING.**
==5==Set me the crown upon my pillow here.

**CLAR.**
==6==His eye is hollow, and he changes much.

**WAR.**
==7==Less noise, less noise!

*Enter Prince Harry.*

**PRINCE.**
==7==           Who saw the Duke of Clarence?

**CLAR.**
==8==I am here, brother, full of heaviness.

**PRINCE.**
==9==How now, rain within doors, and none abroad?
==10==How doth the King?

**GLOU.**
==11==Exceeding ill.

**PRINCE.**
==11==        Heard he the good news yet?
==12==Tell it him.

**GLOU.**
==13==He alt’red much upon the hearing it.

**PRINCE.**
==14==If he be sick with joy, he’ll recover without physic.

**WAR.**
==15==Not so much noise, my lords. Sweet Prince, speak low,
==16==The King your father is dispos’d to sleep.

**CLAR.**
==17==Let us withdraw into the other room.

**WAR.**
==18==Will’t please your Grace to go along with us?

**PRINCE.**
==19==No, I will sit and watch here by the King.
*(Exeunt all but the Prince.)*
==20==Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,
==21==Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
==22==O polish’d perturbation! Golden care!
==23==That keep’st the ports of slumber open wide
==24==To many a watchful night, sleep with it now!
==25==Yet not so sound, and half so deeply sweet,
==26==As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
==27==Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
==28==When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
==29==Like a rich armor worn in heat of day,
==30==That scald’st with safety. By his gates of breath
==31==There lies a downy feather which stirs not.
==32==Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
==33==Perforce must move. My gracious lord! My father!
==34==This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep
==35==That from this golden rigol hath divorc’d
==36==So many English kings. Thy due from me
==37==Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,
==38==Which nature, love, and filial tenderness
==39==Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously.
==40==My due from thee is this imperial crown,
==41==Which as immediate from thy place and blood,
==42==Derives itself to me.
*(Puts on the crown.)*
==42==           Lo where it sits,
==43==Which God shall guard; and put the world’s whole strength
==44==Into one giant arm, it shall not force
==45==This lineal honor from me. This from thee
==46==Will I to mine leave, as ’tis left to me.

*Exit.*

**KING.**
==47==Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!

*Enter Warwick, Gloucester, Clarence, and the rest.*

**CLAR.**
==47==                  Doth the King call?

**WAR.**
==48==What would your Majesty? How fares your Grace?

**KING.**
==49==Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?

**CLAR.**
==50==We left the Prince my brother here, my liege,
==51==Who undertook to sit and watch by you.

**KING.**
==52==The Prince of Wales, where is he? Let me see him.
==53==He is not here.

**WAR.**
==54==This door is open, he is gone this way.

**GLOU.**
==55==He came not through the chamber where we stay’d.

**KING.**
==56==Where is the crown? Who took it from my pillow?

**WAR.**
==57==When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.

**KING.**
==58==The Prince hath ta’en it hence. Go seek him out.
==59==Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
==60==My sleep my death?
==61==Find him, my Lord of Warwick, chide him hither.
*(Exit Warwick.)*
==62==This part of his conjoins with my disease,
==63==And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!
==64==How quickly nature falls into revolt
==65==When gold becomes her object!
==66==For this the foolish over-careful fathers
==67==Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,
==68==Their bones with industry;
==69==For this they have engrossed and pil’d up
==70==The cank’red heaps of strange-achieved gold;
==71==For this they have been thoughtful to invest
==72==Their sons with arts and martial exercises;
==73==When like the bee tolling from every flower
==74==The virtuous sweets,
==75==Our thighs pack’d with wax, our mouths with honey,
==76==We bring it to the hive, and like the bees,
==77==Are murd’red for our pains. This bitter taste
==78==Yields his engrossments to the ending father.
*(Enter Warwick.)*
==79==Now, where is he that will not stay so long
==80==Till his friend sickness have determin’d me?

**WAR.**
==81==My lord, I found the Prince in the next room,
==82==Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,
==83==With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
==84==That tyranny, which never quaff’d but blood,
==85==Would, by beholding him, have wash’d his knife
==86==With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.

**KING.**
==87==But wherefore did he take away the crown?
*(Enter Prince Harry.)*
==88==Lo where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.
==89==Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.

*Exeunt Warwick and the rest.*

**PRINCE.**
==90==I never thought to hear you speak again.

**KING.**
==91==Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:
==92==I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
==93==Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
==94==That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honors
==95==Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth,
==96==Thou seek’st the greatness that will overwhelm thee.
==97==Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity
==98==Is held from falling with so weak a wind
==99==That it will quickly drop; my day is dim.
==100==Thou hast stol’n that which after some few hours
==101==Were thine without offense, and at my death
==102==Thou hast seal’d up my expectation.
==103==Thy life did manifest thou lov’dst me not,
==104==And thou wilt have me die assur’d of it.
==105==Thou hid’st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
==106==Whom thou hast whetted on thy stony heart
==107==To stab at half an hour of my life.
==108==What, canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
==109==Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself,
==110==And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
==111==That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
==112==Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
==113==Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head;
==114==Only compound me with forgotten dust;
==115==Give that which gave thee life unto the worms,
==116==Pluck down my officers, break my decrees,
==117==For now a time is come to mock at form.
==118==Harry the Fifth is crown’d! Up, vanity!
==119==Down, royal state! All you sage counsellors, hence!
==120==And to the English court assemble now,
==121==From every region, apes of idleness!
==122==Now, neighbor confines, purge you of your scum!
==123==Have you a ruffin that will swear, drink, dance,
==124==Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
==125==The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
==126==Be happy, he will trouble you no more.
==127==England shall double gild his treble guilt,
==128==England shall give him office, honor, might;
==129==For the fifth Harry from curb’d license plucks
==130==The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
==131==Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
==132==O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
==133==When that my care could not withhold thy riots,
==134==What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
==135==O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,
==136==Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!

**PRINCE.**
==137==O, pardon me, my liege! But for my tears,
==138==The moist impediments unto my speech,
==139==I had forestall’d this dear and deep rebuke
==140==Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
==141==The course of it so far. There is your crown;
==142==And He that wears the crown immortally
==143==Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
==144==Than as your honor and as your renown,
==145==Let me no more from this obedience rise,
*(Kneels.)*
==146==Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
==147==Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending.
==148==God witness with me, when I here came in,
==149==And found no course of breath within your Majesty,
==150==How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
==151==O, let me in my present wildness die,
==152==And never live to show th’ incredulous world
==153==The noble change that I have purposed!
==154==Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
==155==And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
==156==I spake unto this crown as having sense,
==157==And thus upbraided it: “The care on thee depending
==158==Hath fed upon the body of my father;
==159==Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold.
==160==Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
==161==Preserving life in med’cine potable;
==162==But thou, most fine, most honor’d, most renown’d,
==163==Hast eat thy bearer up.” Thus, my most royal liege,
==164==Accusing it, I put it on my head,
==165==To try with it, as with an enemy
==166==That had before my face murdered my father,
==167==The quarrel of a true inheritor.
==168==But if it did infect my blood with joy,
==169==Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride,
==170==If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
==171==Did with the least affection of a welcome
==172==Give entertainment to the might of it,
==173==Let God forever keep it from my head,
==174==And make me as the poorest vassal is
==175==That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!

**KING.**
==176==O my son,
==177==God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
==178==That thou mightst win the more thy father’s love,
==179==Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
==180==Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed,
==181==And hear (I think) the very latest counsel
==182==That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
==183==By what by-paths and indirect crook’d ways
==184==I met this crown, and I myself know well
==185==How troublesome it sate upon my head.
==186==To thee it shall descend with better quiet,
==187==Better opinion, better confirmation,
==188==For all the soil of the achievement goes
==189==With me into the earth. It seem’d in me
==190==But as an honor snatch’d with boist’rous hand,
==191==And I had many living to upbraid
==192==My gain of it by their assistances,
==193==Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
==194==Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears
==195==Thou seest with peril I have answered;
==196==For all my reign hath been but as a scene
==197==Acting that argument. And now my death
==198==Changes the mood, for what in me was purchas’d
==199==Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
==200==So thou the garland wear’st successively.
==201==Yet though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,
==202==Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green,
==203==And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
==204==Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out;
==205==By whose fell working I was first advanc’d,
==206==And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
==207==To be again displac’d; which to avoid,
==208==I cut them off, and had a purpose now
==209==To lead out many to the Holy Land,
==210==Lest rest and lying still might make them look
==211==Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
==212==Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
==213==With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out,
==214==May waste the memory of the former days.
==215==More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
==216==That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
==217==How I came by the crown, O God forgive,
==218==And grant it may with thee in true peace live!

**PRINCE.**
==219==My gracious liege,
==220==You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;
==221==Then plain and right must my possession be,
==222==Which I with more than with a common pain
==223==’Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.

*Enter Prince John of Lancaster.*

**KING.**
==224==Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.

**P. JOHN.**
==225==Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!

**KING.**
==226==Thou bring’st me happiness and peace, son John,
==227==But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown
==228==From this bare wither’d trunk. Upon thy sight
==229==My worldly business makes a period.
==230==Where is my Lord of Warwick?

**PRINCE.**
==230==                My Lord of Warwick!

*Enter Warwick.*

**KING.**
==231==Doth any name particular belong
==232==Unto the lodging where I first did swound?

**WAR.**
==233==’Tis call’d Jerusalem, my noble lord.

**KING.**
==234==Laud be to God! Even there my life must end.
==235==It hath been prophesied to me many years,
==236==I should not die but in Jerusalem,
==237==Which vainly I suppos’d the Holy Land.
==238==But bear me to that chamber, there I’ll lie,
==239==In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.

*Exeunt.*
