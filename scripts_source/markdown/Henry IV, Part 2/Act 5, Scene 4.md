## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*London. A street.*

*Enter Beadle and three or four Officers with Hostess Quickly and Doll Tearsheet.*

**HOST.**
==1== No, thou arrant knave, I would to God that I might die, that I might have thee hang’d. Thou hast drawn my shoulder out of joint.

**BEAD.**
==2== The constables have deliver’d her over to me, and she shall have whipping cheer, I warrant her. There hath been a man or two kill’d about her.

**DOLL.**
==3== Nuthook, nuthook, you lie. Come on! I’ll tell thee what, thou damn’d tripe-visag’d rascal, and the child I go with do miscarry, thou wert better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou paper-fac’d villain!

**HOST.**
==4== O the Lord, that Sir John were come! I would make this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the fruit of her womb miscarry.

**BEAD.**
==5== If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again; you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go with me, for the man is dead that you and Pistol beat amongst you.

**DOLL.**
==6== I’ll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I will have you as soundly swing’d for this—you blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famish’d correctioner, if you be not swing’d, I’ll forswear half-kirtles.

**BEAD.**
==7== Come, come, you she knight-arrant, come.

**HOST.**
==8== O God, that right should thus overcome might! Well, of sufferance comes ease.

**DOLL.**
==9== Come, you rogue, come bring me to a justice.

**HOST.**
==10== Ay, come, you starv’d bloodhound.

**DOLL.**
==11== Goodman Death, goodman Bones!

**HOST.**
==12== Thou atomy, thou!

**DOLL.**
==13== Come, you thin thing, come, you rascal.

**BEAD.**
==14== Very well.

*Exeunt.*
