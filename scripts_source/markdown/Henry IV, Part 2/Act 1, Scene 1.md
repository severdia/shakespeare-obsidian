## Act 1, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Prologue|← Act 1, Prologue]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Warkworth. Before Northumberland’s castle.*

*Enter the Lord Bardolph at one door.*

**L. BARD.**
==1==Who keeps the gate here ho?
*(Enter Porter.)*
==1==                Where is the Earl?

**PORT.**
==2==What shall I say you are?

**L. BARD.**
==2==              Tell thou the Earl
==3==That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.

**PORT.**
==4==His lordship is walk’d forth into the orchard.
==5==Please it your honor knock but at the gate,
==6==And he himself will answer.

*Enter Henry Percy, the Earl Northumberland, in a night-cap and supporting himself with a staff.*

**L. BARD.**
==6==              Here comes the Earl.

*Exit Porter.*

**NORTH.**
==7==What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now
==8==Should be the father of some stratagem.
==9==The times are wild, contention, like a horse
==10==Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose,
==11==And bears down all before him.

**L. BARD.**
==11==                  Noble Earl,
==12==I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.

**NORTH.**
==13==Good, and God will!

**L. BARD.**
==13==           As good as heart can wish:
==14==The King is almost wounded to the death,
==15==And in the fortune of my lord your son,
==16==Prince Harry slain outright, and both the Blunts
==17==Kill’d by the hand of Douglas, young Prince John
==18==And Westmorland and Stafford fled the field,
==19==And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John,
==20==Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day!
==21==So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
==22==Came not till now to dignify the times,
==23==Since Caesar’s fortunes.

**NORTH.**
==23==              How is this deriv’d?
==24==Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?

**L. BARD.**
==25==I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,
==26==A gentleman well bred and of good name,
==27==That freely rend’red me these news for true.

**NORTH.**
==28==Here comes my servant Travers, who I sent
==29==On Tuesday last to listen after news.

*Enter Travers.*

**L. BARD.**
==30==My lord, I overrode him on the way,
==31==And he is furnish’d with no certainties
==32==More than he haply may retail from me.

**NORTH.**
==33==Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?

**TRA.**
==34==My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn’d me back
==35==With joyful tidings, and being better hors’d,
==36==Outrode me. After him came spurring hard
==37==A gentleman, almost forespent with speed,
==38==That stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
==39==He ask’d the way to Chester, and of him
==40==I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.
==41==He told me that rebellion had bad luck,
==42==And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.
==43==With that he gave his able horse the head,
==44==And bending forward struck his armed heels
==45==Against the panting sides of his poor jade
==46==Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
==47==He seem’d in running to devour the way,
==48==Staying no longer question.

**NORTH.**
==48==                Ha? Again.
==49==Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?
==50==Of Hotspur, Coldspur? That rebellion
==51==Had met ill luck?

**L. BARD.**
==51==           My lord, I’ll tell you what:
==52==If my young lord your son have not the day,
==53==Upon mine honor, for a silken point
==54==I’ll give my barony. Never talk of it.

**NORTH.**
==55==Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
==56==Give then such instances of loss?

**L. BARD.**
==56==                  Who, he?
==57==He was some hilding fellow that had stol’n
==58==The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
==59==Spoke at a venter. Look, here comes more news.

*Enter Morton.*

**NORTH.**
==60==Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title-leaf,
==61==Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.
==62==So looks the strond whereon the imperious flood
==63==Hath left a witness’d usurpation.
==64==Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?

**MOR.**
==65==I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord,
==66==Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
==67==To fright our party.

**NORTH.**
==67==           How doth my son and brother?
==68==Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek
==69==Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy arrand.
==70==Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
==71==So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
==72==Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night,
==73==And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
==74==But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
==75==And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it.
==76==This thou wouldst say, “Your son did thus and thus;
==77==Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas”⁠—
==78==Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds,
==79==But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
==80==Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
==81==Ending with “Brother, son, and all are dead.”

**MOR.**
==82==Douglas is living, and your brother yet,
==83==But for my lord your son⁠—

**NORTH.**
==83==              Why, he is dead.
==84==See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
==85==He that but fears the thing he would not know
==86==Hath by instinct knowledge from others’ eyes
==87==That what he fear’d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton,
==88==Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
==89==And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
==90==And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.

**MOR.**
==91==You are too great to be by me gainsaid,
==92==Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.

**NORTH.**
==93==Yet for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.
==94==I see a strange confession in thine eye.
==95==Thou shak’st thy head, and hold’st it fear or sin
==96==To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
==97==The tongue offends not that reports his death,
==98==And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
==99==Not he which says the dead is not alive.
==100==Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
==101==Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
==102==Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
==103==Rememb’red tolling a departing friend.

**L. BARD.**
==104==I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.

**MOR.**
==105==I am sorry I should force you to believe
==106==That which I would to God I had not seen,
==107==But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
==108==Rend’ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreath’d,
==109==To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down
==110==The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
==111==From whence with life he never more sprung up.
==112==In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
==113==Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
==114==Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
==115==From the best-temper’d courage in his troops,
==116==For from his metal was his party steeled,
==117==Which once in him abated, all the rest
==118==Turn’d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.
==119==And as the thing that’s heavy in itself
==120==Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
==121==So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss,
==122==Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
==123==That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
==124==Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
==125==Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester
==126==So soon ta’en prisoner, and that furious Scot,
==127==The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword
==128==Had three times slain th’ appearance of the King,
==129==Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
==130==Of those that turn’d their backs, and in his flight,
==131==Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
==132==Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out
==133==A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
==134==Under the conduct of young Lancaster
==135==And Westmorland. This is the news at full.

**NORTH.**
==136==For this I shall have time enough to mourn;
==137==In poison there is physic, and these news,
==138==Having been well, that would have made me sick,
==139==Being sick, have (in some measure) made me well.
==140==And as the wretch whose fever-weak’ned joints,
==141==Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
==142==Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
==143==Out of his keeper’s arms, even so my limbs,
==144==Weak’ned with grief, being now enrag’d with grief,
==145==Are thrice themselves. Hence therefore, thou nice crutch!
==146==A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
==147==Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!
==148==That art a guard too wanton for the head
==149==Which princes, flesh’d with conquest, aim to hit.
==150==Now bind my brows with iron, and approach
==151==The ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring
==152==To frown upon th’ enrag’d Northumberland!
==153==Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature’s hand
==154==Keep the wild flood confin’d! Let order die!
==155==And let this world no longer be a stage
==156==To feed contention in a ling’ring act;
==157==But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
==158==Reign in all bosoms, that each heart being set
==159==On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
==160==And darkness be the burier of the dead!

**L. BARD.**
==161==This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.

**MOR.**
==162==Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honor,
==163==The lives of all your loving complices
==164==Lean on your health, the which, if you give o’er
==165==To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
==166==You cast th’ event of war, my noble lord,
==167==And summ’d the accompt of chance before you said,
==168==“Let us make head.” It was your presurmise
==169==That in the dole of blows your son might drop.
==170==You knew he walk’d o’er perils, on an edge,
==171==More likely to fall in than to get o’er;
==172==You were advis’d his flesh was capable
==173==Of wounds and scars; and that his forward spirit
==174==Would lift him where most trade of danger rang’d;
==175==Yet did you say, “Go forth!” and none of this
==176==(Though strongly apprehended) could restrain
==177==The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall’n?
==178==Or what doth this bold enterprise bring forth
==179==More than that being which was like to be?

**L. BARD.**
==180==We all that are engaged to this loss
==181==Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
==182==That if we wrought out life ’twas ten to one,
==183==And yet we ventur’d for the gain propos’d,
==184==Chok’d the respect of likely peril fear’d,
==185==And since we are o’erset, venture again.
==186==Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.

**MOR.**
==187==’Tis more than time, and, my most noble lord,
==188==I hear for certain and dare speak the truth,
==189==The gentle Archbishop of York is up
==190==With well-appointed pow’rs. He is a man
==191==Who with a double surety binds his followers.
==192==My lord your son had only but the corpse’,
==193==But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
==194==For that same word, rebellion, did divide
==195==The action of their bodies from their souls,
==196==And they did fight with queasiness, constrain’d
==197==As men drink potions, that their weapons only
==198==Seem’d on our side; but for their spirits and souls,
==199==This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
==200==As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop
==201==Turns insurrection to religion.
==202==Suppos’d sincere and holy in his thoughts,
==203==He’s follow’d both with body and with mind;
==204==And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
==205==Of fair King Richard, scrap’d from Pomfret stones;
==206==Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
==207==Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,
==208==Gasping for life under great Bullingbrook,
==209==And more and less do flock to follow him.

**NORTH.**
==210==I knew of this before, but to speak truth,
==211==This present grief had wip’d it from my mind.
==212==Go in with me, and counsel every man
==213==The aptest way for safety and revenge.
==214==Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed⁠—
==215==Never so few, and never yet more need.

*Exeunt.*
