## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*York. A room in the Archbishop’s palace.*

*Enter the Archbishop of York, Thomas Mowbray Earl Marshal, the Lord Hastings, and Lord Bardolph.*

**ARCH.**
==1== Thus have you heard our cause and known our means,
==2== And, my most noble friends, I pray you all
==3== Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes.
==4== And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?

**MOWB.**
==5== I well allow the occasion of our arms,
==6== But gladly would be better satisfied
==7== How in our means we should advance ourselves
==8== To look with forehead bold and big enough
==9== Upon the power and puissance of the King.

**HAST.**
==10== Our present musters grow upon the file
==11== To five and twenty thousand men of choice,
==12== And our supplies live largely in the hope
==13== Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
==14== With an incensed fire of injuries.

**L. BARD.**
==15== The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:
==16== Whether our present five and twenty thousand
==17== May hold up head without Northumberland?

**HAST.**
==18== With him, we may.

**L. BARD.**
==18==            Yea, marry, there’s the point!
==19== But if without him we be thought too feeble,
==20== My judgment is we should not step too far
==21== Till we had his assistance by the hand.
==22== For in a theme so bloody-fac’d as this,
==23== Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
==24== Of aids incertain should not be admitted.

**ARCH.**
==25== ’Tis very true, Lord Bardolph, for indeed
==26== It was young Hotspur’s cause at Shrewsbury.

**L. BARD.**
==27== It was, my lord, who lin’d himself with hope,
==28== Eating the air, and promise of supply,
==29== Flatt’ring himself in project of a power
==30== Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,
==31== And so with great imagination,
==32== Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,
==33== And winking, leapt into destruction.

**HAST.**
==34== But by your leave, it never yet did hurt
==35== To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.

**L. BARD.**
==36== Yes, if this present quality of war⁠—
==37== Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot⁠—
==38== Lives so in hope, as in an early spring
==39== We see th’ appearing buds, which to prove fruit
==40== Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair
==41== That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
==42== We first survey the plot, then draw the model,
==43== And when we see the figure of the house,
==44== Then must we rate the cost of the erection,
==45== Which if we find outweighs ability,
==46== What do we then but draw anew the model
==47== In fewer offices, or at least desist
==48== To build at all? Much more, in this great work
==49== (Which is, almost, to pluck a kingdom down
==50== And set another up), should we survey
==51== The plot of situation and the model,
==52== Consent upon a sure foundation,
==53== Question surveyors, know our own estate,
==54== How able such a work to undergo,
==55== To weigh against his opposite; or else
==56== We fortify in paper and in figures,
==57== Using the names of men in stead of men,
==58== Like one that draws the model of an house
==59== Beyond his power to build it, who, half thorough,
==60== Gives o’er, and leaves his part-created cost
==61== A naked subject to the weeping clouds
==62== And waste for churlish winter’s tyranny.

**HAST.**
==63== Grant that our hopes (yet likely of fair birth) 
==64== Should be still-born, and that we now possess’d
==65== The utmost man of expectation,
==66== I think we are so a body strong enough,
==67== Even as we are, to equal with the King.

**L. BARD.**
==68== What, is the King but five and twenty thousand?

**HAST.**
==69== To us no more, nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph,
==70== For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
==71== Are in three heads: one power against the French,
==72== And one against Glendower; perforce a third
==73== Must take up us. So is the unfirm King
==74== In three divided, and his coffers sound
==75== With hollow poverty and emptiness.

**ARCH.**
==76== That he should draw his several strengths together,
==77== And come against us in full puissance,
==78== Need not to be dreaded.

**HAST.**
==78==               If he should do so,
==79== To French and Welsh he leaves his back unarm’d,
==80== They baying him at the heels. Never fear that.

**L. BARD.**
==81== Who is it like should lead his forces hither?

**HAST.**
==82== The Duke of Lancaster and Westmorland;
==83== Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth;
==84== But who is substituted against the French,
==85== I have no certain notice.

**ARCH.**
==85==               Let us on!
==86== And publish the occasion of our arms.
==87== The commonwealth is sick of their own choice,
==88== Their over-greedy love hath surfeited.
==89== An habitation giddy and unsure
==90== Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
==91== O thou fond many, with what loud applause
==92== Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bullingbrook
==93== Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!
==94== And being now trimm’d in thine own desires,
==95== Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,
==96== That thou provok’st thyself to cast him up.
==97== So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
==98== Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,
==99== And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
==100== And howl’st to find it. What trust is in these times?
==101== They that, when Richard liv’d, would have him die,
==102== Are now become enamor’d on his grave.
==103== Thou, that threw’st dust upon his goodly head
==104== When through proud London he came sighing on
==105== After th’ admired heels of Bullingbrook,
==106== Cri’st now, “O earth, yield us that king again,
==107== And take thou this!” O thoughts of men accurs’d!
==108== Past and to come seems best; things present worst.

**MOWB.**
==109== Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?

**HAST.**
==110== We are time’s subjects, and time bids be gone.

*Exeunt.*
