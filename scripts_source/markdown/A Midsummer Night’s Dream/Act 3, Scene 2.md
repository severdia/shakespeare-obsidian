## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the woods.*

*Enter King of Fairies Oberon.*

**OBE.**
==1==I wonder if Titania be awak’d;
==2==Then what it was that next came in her eye,
==3==Which she must dote on in extremity.
*(Enter Puck.)*
==4==Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?
==5==What night-rule now about this haunted grove?

**PUCK.**
==6==My mistress with a monster is in love.
==7==Near to her close and consecrated bower,
==8==While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
==9==A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
==10==That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
==11==Were met together to rehearse a play
==12==Intended for great Theseus’ nuptial day.
==13==The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
==14==Who Pyramus presented, in their sport,
==15==Forsook his scene, and ent’red in a brake;
==16==When I did him at this advantage take,
==17==An ass’s nole I fixed on his head.
==18==Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
==19==And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
==20==As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
==21==Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort
==22==(Rising and cawing at the gun’s report),
==23==Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
==24==So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
==25==And at our stamp, here o’er and o’er one falls;
==26==He murder cries, and help from Athens calls.
==27==Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thus strong,
==28==Made senseless things begin to do them wrong,
==29==For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
==30==Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all things catch.
==31==I led them on in this distracted fear,
==32==And left sweet Pyramus translated there;
==33==When in that moment (so it came to pass) 
==34==Titania wak’d, and straightway lov’d an ass.

**OBE.**
==35==This falls out better than I could devise.
==36==But hast thou yet latch’d the Athenian’s eyes
==37==With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?

**PUCK.**
==38==I took him sleeping (that is finish’d too) 
==39==And the Athenian woman by his side;
==40==That when he wak’d, of force she must be ey’d.

*Enter Demetrius and Hermia.*

**OBE.**
==41==Stand close; this is the same Athenian.

**PUCK.**
==42==This is the woman; but not this the man.

**DEM.**
==43==O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
==44==Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

**HER.**
==45==Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
==46==For thou (I fear) hast given me cause to curse.
==47==If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
==48==Being o’er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
==49==And kill me too.
==50==The sun was not so true unto the day
==51==As he to me. Would he have stolen away
==52==From sleeping Hermia? I’ll believe as soon
==53==This whole earth may be bor’d, and that the moon
==54==May through the center creep, and so displease
==55==Her brother’s noontide with th’ Antipodes.
==56==It cannot be but thou hast murd’red him;
==57==So should a murderer look—so dead, so grim.

**DEM.**
==58==So should the murdered look, and so should I,
==59==Pierc’d through the heart with your stern cruelty.
==60==Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
==61==As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.

**HER.**
==62==What’s this to my Lysander? Where is he?
==63==Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

**DEM.**
==64==I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

**HER.**
==65==Out, dog, out, cur! Thou driv’st me past the bounds
==66==Of maiden’s patience. Hast thou slain him then?
==67==Henceforth be never numb’red among men!
==68==O, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!
==69==Durst thou have look’d upon him being awake?
==70==And hast thou kill’d him sleeping? O brave touch!
==71==Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
==72==An adder did it! For with doubler tongue
==73==Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.

**DEM.**
==74==You spend your passion on a mispris’d mood.
==75==I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood;
==76==Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

**HER.**
==77==I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.

**DEM.**
==78==And if I could, what should I get therefore?

**HER.**
==79==A privilege never to see me more.
==80==And from thy hated presence part I so:
==81==See me no more, whether he be dead or no.

*Exit.*

**DEM.**
==82==There is no following her in this fierce vein.
==83==Here therefore for a while I will remain.
==84==So sorrow’s heaviness doth heavier grow
==85==For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe;
==86==Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
==87==If for his tender here I make some stay.

*Lie down and sleep.*

**OBE.**
==88==What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite,
==89==And laid the love-juice on some true-love’s sight.
==90==Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
==91==Some true love turn’d, and not a false turn’d true.

**PUCK.**
==92==Then fate o’errules, that one man holding troth,
==93==A million fail, confounding oath on oath.

**OBE.**
==94==About the wood go swifter than the wind,
==95==And Helena of Athens look thou find.
==96==All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer
==97==With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear.
==98==By some illusion see thou bring her here.
==99==I’ll charm his eyes against she do appear.

**PUCK.**
==100==I go, I go, look how I go,
==101==Swifter than arrow from the Tartar’s bow.

*Exit.*

**OBE.**
==102==*Flower of this purple dye,*
==103==*Hit with Cupid’s archery,*
==104==*Sink in apple of his eye.*
==105==*When his love he doth espy,*
==106==*Let her shine as gloriously*
==107==*As the Venus of the sky.*
==108==*When thou wak’st, if she be by,*
==109==*Beg of her for remedy.*

*Enter Puck.*

**PUCK.**
==110==*Captain of our fairy band,*
==111==*Helena is here at hand,*
==112==*And the youth, mistook by me,*
==113==*Pleading for a lover’s fee.*
==114==*Shall we their fond pageant see?*
==115==*Lord, what fools these mortals be!*

**OBE.**
==116==*Stand aside. The noise they make*
==117==*Will cause Demetrius to awake.*

**PUCK.**
==118==*Then will two at once woo one;*
==119==*That must needs be sport alone.*
==120==*And those things do best please me*
==121==*That befall prepost’rously.*

*Enter Lysander and Helena.*

**LYS.**
==122==Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
==123==Scorn and derision never come in tears.
==124==Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
==125==In their nativity all truth appears.
==126==How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
==127==Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?

**HEL.**
==128==You do advance your cunning more and more;
==129==When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
==130==These vows are Hermia’s. Will you give her o’er?
==131==Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh.
==132==Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
==133==Will even weigh; and both as light as tales.

**LYS.**
==134==I had no judgment when to her I swore.

**HEL.**
==135==Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o’er.

**LYS.**
==136==Demetrius loves her; and he loves not you.

**DEM.**
*(Awaking.)*
==137==O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
==138==To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
==139==Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
==140==Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
==141==That pure congealed white, high Taurus’ snow,
==142==Fann’d with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
==143==When thou hold’st up thy hand. O, let me kiss
==144==This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!

**HEL.**
==145==O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
==146==To set against me for your merriment.
==147==If you were civil and knew courtesy,
==148==You would not do me thus much injury.
==149==Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
==150==But you must join in souls to mock me too?
==151==If you were men, as men you are in show,
==152==You would not use a gentle lady so;
==153==To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
==154==When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
==155==You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
==156==And now both rivals, to mock Helena.
==157==A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
==158==To conjure tears up in a poor maid’s eyes
==159==With your derision! None of noble sort
==160==Would so offend a virgin, and extort
==161==A poor soul’s patience, all to make you sport.

**LYS.**
==162==You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
==163==For you love Hermia; this you know I know.
==164==And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
==165==In Hermia’s love I yield you up my part;
==166==And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
==167==Whom I do love, and will do till my death.

**HEL.**
==168==Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

**DEM.**
==169==Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none.
==170==If e’er I lov’d her, all that love is gone.
==171==My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn’d,
==172==And now to Helen is it home return’d,
==173==There to remain.

**LYS.**
==173==           Helen, it is not so.

**DEM.**
==174==Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
==175==Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
==176==Look where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.

*Enter Hermia.*

**HER.**
==177==Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
==178==The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
==179==Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
==180==It pays the hearing double recompense,
==181==Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
==182==Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.
==183==But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

**LYS.**
==184==Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?

**HER.**
==185==What love could press Lysander from my side?

**LYS.**
==186==Lysander’s love, that would not let him bide⁠—
==187==Fair Helena! Who more engilds the night
==188==Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.
==189==Why seek’st thou me? Could not this make thee know,
==190==The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?

**HER.**
==191==You speak not as you think. It cannot be.

**HEL.**
==192==Lo! She is one of this confederacy.
==193==Now I perceive, they have conjoin’d all three
==194==To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
==195==Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid!
==196==Have you conspir’d, have you with these contriv’d
==197==To bait me with this foul derision?
==198==Is all the counsel that we two have shar’d,
==199==The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent,
==200==When we have chid the hasty-footed time
==201==For parting us—O, is all forgot?
==202==All school-days friendship, childhood innocence?
==203==We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
==204==Have with our needles created both one flower,
==205==Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
==206==Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
==207==As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds
==208==Had been incorporate. So we grew together,
==209==Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
==210==But yet an union in partition,
==211==Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
==212==So with two seeming bodies, but one heart,
==213==Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
==214==Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.
==215==And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
==216==To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
==217==It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.
==218==Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
==219==Though I alone do feel the injury.

**HER.**
==220==I am amazed at your passionate words.
==221==I scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.

**HEL.**
==222==Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
==223==To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
==224==And made your other love, Demetrius
==225==(Who even but now did spurn me with his foot),
==226==To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
==227==Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
==228==To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander
==229==Deny your love (so rich within his soul) 
==230==And tender me (forsooth) affection,
==231==But by your setting on, by your consent?
==232==What though I be not so in grace as you,
==233==So hung upon with love, so fortunate
==234==(But miserable most, to love unlov’d)?
==235==This you should pity rather than despise.

**HER.**
==236==I understand not what you mean by this.

**HEL.**
==237==Ay, do! Persever, counterfeit sad looks,
==238==Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,
==239==Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up;
==240==This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
==241==If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
==242==You would not make me such an argument.
==243==But fare ye well; ’tis partly my own fault,
==244==Which death, or absence, soon shall remedy.

**LYS.**
==245==Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse,
==246==My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!

**HEL.**
==247==O excellent!

**HER.**
==247==        Sweet, do not scorn her so.

**DEM.**
==248==If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

**LYS.**
==249==Thou canst compel no more than she entreat.
==250==Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prays.
==251==Helen, I love thee, by my life I do!
==252==I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
==253==To prove him false that says I love thee not.

**DEM.**
==254==I say I love thee more than he can do.

**LYS.**
==255==If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.

**DEM.**
==256==Quick, come!

**HER.**
==256==        Lysander, whereto tends all this?

**LYS.**
==257==Away, you Ethiop!

**DEM.**
==257==           No, no; he’ll
==258==Seem to break loose—take on as you would follow,
==259==But yet come not. You are a tame man, go!

**LYS.**
==260==Hang off, thou cat, thou bur! Vile thing, let loose;
==261==Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!

**HER.**
==262==Why are you grown so rude? What change is this,
==263==Sweet love?

**LYS.**
==263==        Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out!
==264==Out, loathed med’cine! O hated potion, hence!

**HER.**
==265==Do you not jest?

**HEL.**
==265==           Yes, sooth; and so do you.

**LYS.**
==266==Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.

**DEM.**
==267==I would I had your bond, for I perceive
==268==A weak bond holds you. I’ll not trust your word.

**LYS.**
==269==What? Should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
==270==Although I hate her, I’ll not harm her so.

**HER.**
==271==What? Can you do me greater harm than hate?
==272==Hate me, wherefore? O me, what news, my love!
==273==Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?
==274==I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
==275==Since night you lov’d me; yet since night you left me:
==276==Why then, you left me (O, the gods forbid!) 
==277==In earnest, shall I say?

**LYS.**
==277==           Ay, by my life;
==278==And never did desire to see thee more.
==279==Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
==280==Be certain! Nothing truer; ’tis no jest
==281==That I do hate thee, and love Helena.

**HER.**
==282==O me, you juggler, you canker-blossom,
==283==You thief of love! What, have you come by night
==284==And stol’n my love’s heart from him?

**HEL.**
==284==                     Fine, i’ faith!
==285==Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
==286==No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
==287==Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
==288==Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

**HER.**
==289==“Puppet”? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.
==290==Now I perceive that she hath made compare
==291==Between our statures: she hath urg’d her height,
==292==And with her personage, her tall personage,
==293==Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail’d with him.
==294==And are you grown so high in his esteem,
==295==Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
==296==How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak!
==297==How low am I? I am not yet so low
==298==But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

**HEL.**
==299==I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
==300==Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;
==301==I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
==302==I am a right maid for my cowardice.
==303==Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
==304==Because she is something lower than myself,
==305==That I can match her.

**HER.**
==305==           “Lower”? Hark again.

**HEL.**
==306==Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
==307==I evermore did love you, Hermia,
==308==Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong’d you;
==309==Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
==310==I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
==311==He followed you; for love I followed him.
==312==But he hath chid me hence, and threat’ned me
==313==To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too.
==314==And now, so you will let me quiet go,
==315==To Athens will I bear my folly back,
==316==And follow you no further. Let me go.
==317==You see how simple and how fond I am.

**HER.**
==318==Why, get you gone. Who is’t that hinders you?

**HEL.**
==319==A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.

**HER.**
==320==What, with Lysander?

**HEL.**
==320==              With Demetrius.

**LYS.**
==321==Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.

**DEM.**
==322==No, sir; she shall not, though you take her part.

**HEL.**
==323==O, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd!
==324==She was a vixen when she went to school;
==325==And though she be but little, she is fierce.

**HER.**
==326==“Little” again? Nothing but “low” and “little”?
==327==Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
==328==Let me come to her.

**LYS.**
==328==           Get you gone, you dwarf;
==329==You minimus, of hind’ring knot-grass made;
==330==You bead, you acorn.

**DEM.**
==330==           You are too officious
==331==In her behalf that scorns your services.
==332==Let her alone; speak not of Helena,
==333==Take not her part. For if thou dost intend
==334==Never so little show of love to her,
==335==Thou shalt aby it.

**LYS.**
==335==           Now she holds me not;
==336==Now follow, if thou dar’st, to try whose right,
==337==Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.

**DEM.**
==338==Follow? Nay; I’ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.

*Exeunt Lysander and Demetrius.*

**HER.**
==339==You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
==340==Nay, go not back.

**HEL.**
==340==           I will not trust you, I,
==341==Nor longer stay in your curst company.
==342==Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray;
==343==My legs are longer though, to run away.

*Exit.*

**HER.**
==344==I am amaz’d, and know not what to say.

*Exit.*

**OBE.**
==345==This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak’st,
==346==Or else commit’st thy knaveries willfully.

**PUCK.**
==347==Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
==348==Did not you tell me I should know the man
==349==By the Athenian garments he had on?
==350==And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
==351==That I have ’nointed an Athenian’s eyes;
==352==And so far am I glad it so did sort,
==353==As this their jangling I esteem a sport.

**OBE.**
==354==Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight;
==355==Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
==356==The starry welkin cover thou anon
==357==With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
==358==And lead these testy rivals so astray
==359==As one come not within another’s way.
==360==Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue;
==361==Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
==362==And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
==363==And from each other look thou lead them thus,
==364==Till o’er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
==365==With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.
==366==Then crush this herb into Lysander’s eye;
==367==Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
==368==To take from thence all error with his might,
==369==And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
==370==When they next wake, all this derision
==371==Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
==372==And back to Athens shall the lovers wend
==373==With league whose date till death shall never end.
==374==Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
==375==I’ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
==376==And then I will her charmed eye release
==377==From monster’s view, and all things shall be peace.

**PUCK.**
==378==My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
==379==For Night’s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
==380==And yonder shines Aurora’s harbinger,
==381==At whose approach, ghosts, wand’ring here and there,
==382==Troop home to churchyards. Damned spirits all,
==383==That in crossways and floods have burial,
==384==Already to their wormy beds are gone.
==385==For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
==386==They willfully themselves exile from light,
==387==And must for aye consort with black-brow’d Night.

**OBE.**
==388==But we are spirits of another sort.
==389==I with the Morning’s love have oft made sport,
==390==And like a forester, the groves may tread
==391==Even till the eastern gate, all fiery red,
==392==Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
==393==Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
==394==But notwithstanding, haste, make no delay;
==395==We may effect this business yet ere day.

*Exit.*

**PUCK.**
==396==*Up and down, up and down,*
==397==*I will lead them up and down;*
==398==*I am fear’d in field and town.*
==399==*Goblin, lead them up and down.*
==400==Here comes one.

*Enter Lysander.*

**LYS.**
==401==Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.

**PUCK.**
==402==Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?

**LYS.**
==403==I will be with thee straight.

**PUCK.**
==403==              Follow me then
==404==To plainer ground.

*Exit Lysander, as following the voice.*

*Enter Demetrius.*

**DEM.**
==404==           Lysander, speak again!
==405==Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
==406==Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?

**PUCK.**
==407==Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
==408==Telling the bushes that thou look’st for wars,
==409==And wilt not come? Come, recreant, come, thou child,
==410==I’ll whip thee with a rod. He is defil’d
==411==That draws a sword on thee.

**DEM.**
==411==                Yea, art thou there?

**PUCK.**
==412==Follow my voice; we’ll try no manhood here.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Lysander.*

**LYS.**
==413==He goes before me, and still dares me on.
==414==When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
==415==The villain is much lighter-heel’d than I;
==416==I followed fast, but faster he did fly,
==417==That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
==418==And here will rest me.
*(Lie down.)*
==418==              Come, thou gentle day!
==419==For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
==420==I’ll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.

*Sleeps.*

*Enter Puck and Demetrius.*

**PUCK.**
==421==Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why com’st thou not?

**DEM.**
==422==Abide me, if thou dar’st; for well I wot
==423==Thou run’st before me, shifting every place,
==424==And dar’st not stand, nor look me in the face.
==425==Where art thou now?

**PUCK.**
==425==           Come hither; I am here.

**DEM.**
==426==Nay then thou mock’st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
==427==If ever I thy face by daylight see.
==428==Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
==429==To measure out my length on this cold bed.
==430==By day’s approach look to be visited.

*Lies down and sleeps.*

*Enter Helena.*

**HEL.**
==431==O weary night, O long and tedious night,
==432==Abate thy hours! Shine, comforts, from the east,
==433==That I may back to Athens by daylight,
==434==From these that my poor company detest.
==435==And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow’s eye,
==436==Steal me a while from mine own company.

*Sleep.*

**PUCK.**
==437==*Yet but three? Come one more;*
==438==*Two of both kinds makes up four.*
*(Enter Hermia.)*
==439==*Here she comes, curst and sad.*
==440==*Cupid is a knavish lad,*
==441==*Thus to make poor females mad.*

**HER.**
==442==Never so weary, never so in woe,
==443==Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
==444==I can no further crawl, no further go;
==445==My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
==446==Here will I rest me till the break of day.
==447==Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!

*Lies down and sleeps.*

**PUCK.**
==448==*On the ground,*
==449==*Sleep sound;*
==450==*I’ll apply,*
==451==*To your eye,*
==452==Gentle lover, remedy.
*(Squeezing the juice on Lysander’s eyes.)*
==453==*When thou wak’st,*
==454==*Thou tak’st*
==455==*True delight*
==456==*In the sight*
==457==Of thy former lady’s eye;
==458==And the country proverb known,
==459==That every man should take his own,
==460==In your waking shall be shown.
==461==*Jack shall have Jill;*
==462==*Nought shall go ill:*
==463==The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

*Exit.*
