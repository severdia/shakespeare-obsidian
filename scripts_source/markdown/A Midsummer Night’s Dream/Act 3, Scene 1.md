## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*In the woods.*

*Enter the Clowns: Quince, Snug, Bottom, Flute, Snout, and Starveling. Titania still sleeps.*

**BOT.**
==1==Are we all met?

**QUIN.**
==2==Pat, pat; and here’s a marvail’s convenient place for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action as we will do it before the Duke.

**BOT.**
==3==Peter Quince!

**QUIN.**
==4==What sayest thou, bully Bottom?

**BOT.**
==5==There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?

**SNOUT.**
==6==By’r lakin, a parlous fear.

**STAR.**
==7==I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.

**BOT.**
==8==Not a whit! I have a device to make all well. Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill’d indeed; and for the more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put them out of fear.

**QUIN.**
==9==Well; we will have such a prologue, and it shall be written in eight and six.

**BOT.**
==10==No; make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.

**SNOUT.**
==11==Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?

**STAR.**
==12==I fear it, I promise you.

**BOT.**
==13==Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves, to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies, is a most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to look to’t.

**SNOUT.**
==14==Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.

**BOT.**
==15==Nay; you must name his name, and half his face must be seen through the lion’s neck, and he himself must speak through, saying thus, or to the same defect: “Ladies,” or “Fair ladies, I would wish you,” or “I would request you,” or “I would entreat you, not to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No! I am no such thing; I am a man as other men are”; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.

**QUIN.**
==16==Well; it shall be so. But there is two hard things: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for you know, Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.

**SNOUT.**
==17==Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?

**BOT.**
==18==A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac. Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.

**QUIN.**
==19==Yes; it doth shine that night.

**BOT.**
==20==Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window (where we play) open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.

**QUIN.**
==21==Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisbe (says the story) did talk through the chink of a wall.

**SNOUT.**
==22==You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?

**BOT.**
==23==Some man or other must present Wall; and let him have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to signify wall; or let him hold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisbe whisper.

**QUIN.**
==24==If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin. When you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so every one according to his cue.

*Enter Puck, behind.*

**PUCK.**
==25==What hempen home-spuns have we swagg’ring here,
==26==So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?
==27==What, a play toward? I’ll be an auditor,
==28==An actor too perhaps, if I see cause.

**QUIN.**
==29==Speak, Pyramus. Thisbe, stand forth.

**BOT.**
==30==“Thisbe, the flowers of odious savors sweet”⁠—

**QUIN.**
==31==Odorous, odorous.

**BOT.**
==31==           —“odors savors sweet;
==32==So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisbe dear.
==33==But hark; a voice! Stay thou but here a while,
==34==And by and by I will to thee appear.”

*Exit.*

**PUCK.**
==35==A stranger Pyramus than e’er played here.

*Exit.*

**FLU.**
==36==Must I speak now?

**QUIN.**
==37==Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.

**FLU.**
==38==“Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
==39==Of color like the red rose on triumphant brier,
==40==Most brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,
==41==As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire,
==42==I’ll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny’s tomb.”

**QUIN.**
==43==“Ninus’ tomb,” man. Why, you must not speak that yet. That you answer to Pyramus. You speak all your part at once, cues and all. Pyramus, enter. Your cue is past; it is “never tire.”

**FLU.**
==44==O—“As true as truest horse, that yet would never tire.”

*Enter Puck, and Bottom with an ass’s head.*

**BOT.**
==45==“If I were fair, Thisbe, I were only thine.”

**QUIN.**
==46==O monstrous! O strange! We are haunted.
==47==Pray, masters, fly, masters! Help!

*Exeunt Quince, Snug, Flute, Snout, and Starveling.*

**PUCK.**
==48==I’ll follow you, I’ll lead you about a round,
==49==Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
==50==Sometime a horse I’ll be, sometime a hound,
==51==A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire,
==52==And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
==53==Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.

*Exit.*

**BOT.**
==54==Why do they run away? This is a knavery of them to make me afeard.

*Enter Snout.*

**SNOUT.**
==55==O Bottom, thou art chang’d! What do I see on thee?

**BOT.**
==56==What do you see? You see an ass-head of your own, do you?

*Exit Snout.*

*Enter Quince.*

**QUIN.**
==57==Bless thee. Bottom, bless thee! Thou art translated.

*Exit.*

**BOT.**
==58==I see their knavery. This is to make an ass of me, to fright me, if they could; but I will not stir from this place, do what they can. I will walk up and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear I am not afraid.
*(Sings.)*
==59== *The woosel cock so black of hue,*
==60== *With orange-tawny bill,*
==61== *The throstle with his note so true,*
==62== *The wren with little quill⁠—*

**TITA.**
*(Awaking.)*
==63==What angel wakes me from my flow’ry bed?

**BOT.**
*(Sings.)*
==64== *The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,*
==65== *The plainsong cuckoo grey,*
==66== *Whose note full many a man doth mark,*
==67== *And dares not answer nay⁠—*
==68==For indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? Who would give a bird the lie, though he cry “cuckoo” never so?

**TITA.**
==69==I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again.
==70==Mine ear is much enamored of thy note;
==71==So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
==72==And thy fair virtue’s force (perforce) doth move me
==73==On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.

**BOT.**
==74==Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason for that. And yet, to say the truth, reason and love keep little company together now-a-days. The more the pity that some honest neighbors will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.

**TITA.**
==75==Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

**BOT.**
==76==Not so, neither; but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I have enough to serve mine owe turn.

**TITA.**
==77==Out of this wood do not desire to go;
==78==Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
==79==I am a spirit of no common rate;
==80==The summer still doth tend upon my state;
==81==And I do love thee; therefore go with me.
==82==I’ll give thee fairies to attend on thee;
==83==And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
==84==And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep.
==85==And I will purge thy mortal grossness so,
==86==That thou shalt like an aery spirit go.
==87==Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! And Mustardseed!

*Enter four Fairies—Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed.*

**PEAS.**
==88==Ready.

**COB.**
==88==    And I.

**MOTH.**
==88==        And I.

**MUS.**
==88==              And I.

**ALL FAIRIES.**
==88==                  Where shall we go?

**TITA.**
==89==Be kind and courteous to this gentleman,
==90==Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
==91==Feed him with apricots and dewberries,
==92==With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
==93==The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
==94==And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs,
==95==And light them at the fiery glow-worm’s eyes,
==96==To have my love to bed and to arise;
==97==And pluck the wings from painted butterflies,
==98==To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes.
==99==Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.

**PEAS.**
==100==Hail, mortal!

**COB.**
==101==Hail!

**MOTH.**
==102==Hail!

**MUS.**
==103==Hail!

**BOT.**
==104==I cry your worships mercy, heartily. I beseech your worship’s name.

**COB.**
==105==Cobweb.

**BOT.**
==106==I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb. If I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you. Your name, honest gentleman?

**PEAS.**
==107==Peaseblossom.

**BOT.**
==108==I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash, your mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?

**MUS.**
==109==Mustardseed.

**BOT.**
==110==Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well. That same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath devour’d many a gentleman of your house. I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Mustardseed.

**TITA.**
==111==Come wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
==112==The moon methinks looks with a wat’ry eye;
==113==And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
==114==Lamenting some enforced chastity.
==115==Tie up my lover’s tongue, bring him silently.

*Exeunt.*
