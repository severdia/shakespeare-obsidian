## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Athens. A room in Quince’s house.*

*Enter Quince the carpenter and Snug the joiner and Bottom the weaver and Flute the bellows-mender and Snout the tinker and Starveling the tailor.*

**QUIN.**
==1== Is all our company here?

**BOT.**
==2== You were best to call them generally, man by man, according to the scrip.

**QUIN.**
==3== Here is the scroll of every man’s name, which is thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our enterlude before the Duke and the Duchess, on his wedding-day at night.

**BOT.**
==4== First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.

**QUIN.**
==5== Marry, our play is The most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisbe.

**BOT.**
==6== A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.

**QUIN.**
==7== Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom the weaver.

**BOT.**
==8== Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.

**QUIN.**
==9== You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

**BOT.**
==10== What is Pyramus? A lover, or a tyrant?

**QUIN.**
==11== A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.

**BOT.**
==12== That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest—yet my chief humor is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.
==13== *“The raging rocks*
==14== *And shivering shocks*
==15== *Shall break the locks*
==16== *Of prison gates;*
==17== *And Phibbus’ car*
==18== *Shall shine from far,*
==19== *And make and mar*
==20== *The foolish Fates.”*
==21== This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein; a lover is more condoling.

**QUIN.**
==22== Francis Flute the bellows-mender.

**FLU.**
==23== Here, Peter Quince.

**QUIN.**
==24== Flute, you must take Thisbe on you.

**FLU.**
==25== What is Thisbe? A wand’ring knight?

**QUIN.**
==26== It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

**FLU.**
==27== Nay, faith; let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.

**QUIN.**
==28== That’s all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small as you will.

**BOT.**
==29== And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbe too. I’ll speak in a monstrous little voice, “Thisne! Thisne!” “Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear! Thy Thisbe dear, and lady dear!”

**QUIN.**
==30== No, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisbe.

**BOT.**
==31== Well, proceed.

**QUIN.**
==32== Robin Starveling the tailor.

**STAR.**
==33== Here, Peter Quince.

**QUIN.**
==34== Robin Starveling, you must play Thisbe’s mother. Tom Snout the tinker.

**SNOUT.**
==35== Here, Peter Quince.

**QUIN.**
==36== You, Pyramus’ father; myself, Thisbe’s father; Snug the joiner, you the lion’s part. And I hope here is a play fitted.

**SNUG.**
==37== Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

**QUIN.**
==38== You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.

**BOT.**
==39== Let me play the lion too. I will roar, that I will do any man’s heart good to hear me. I will roar, that I will make the Duke say, “Let him roar again; let him roar again.”

**QUIN.**
==40== And you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were enough to hang us all.

**ALL.**
==41== That would hang us, every mother’s son.

**BOT.**
==42== I grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies out of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang us; but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove; I will roar you and ’twere any nightingale.

**QUIN.**
==43== You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a sweet-fac’d man; a proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man: therefore you must needs play Pyramus.

**BOT.**
==44== Well; I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?

**QUIN.**
==45== Why, what you will.

**BOT.**
==46== I will discharge it in either your straw-color beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your French-crown-color beard, your perfit yellow.

**QUIN.**
==47== Some of your French crowns have no hair at all; and then you will play barefac’d. But, masters, here are your parts, and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse; for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with company, and our devices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you fail me not.

**BOT.**
==48== We will meet, and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously. Take pains, be perfit; *adieu*.

**QUIN.**
==49== At the Duke’s oak we meet.

**BOT.**
==50== Enough; hold, or cut bow-strings.

*Exeunt.*
