## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Athens. A room in the palace of Theseus.*

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Philostrate, with others.*

**THE.**
==1==Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
==2==Draws on apace. Four happy days bring in
==3==Another moon; but O, methinks, how slow
==4==This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
==5==Like to a step-dame, or a dowager,
==6==Long withering out a young man’s revenue.

**HIP.**
==7==Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
==8==Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
==9==And then the moon, like to a silver bow
==10==New bent in heaven, shall behold the night
==11==Of our solemnities.

**THE.**
==11==           Go, Philostrate,
==12==Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments,
==13==Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,
==14==Turn melancholy forth to funerals:
==15==The pale companion is not for our pomp.
*(Exit Philostrate.)*
==16==Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,
==17==And won thy love doing thee injuries;
==18==But I will wed thee in another key,
==19==With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.

*Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia and Lysander and Demetrius.*

**EGE.**
==20==Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke!

**THE.**
==21==Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?

**EGE.**
==22==Full of vexation come I, with complaint
==23==Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
==24==Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
==25==This man hath my consent to marry her.
==26==Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,
==27==This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.
==28==Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
==29==And interchang’d love-tokens with my child;
==30==Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung
==31==With faining voice verses of faining love,
==32==And stol’n the impression of her fantasy
==33==With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
==34==Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats—messengers
==35==Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth.
==36==With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,
==37==Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me) 
==38==To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,
==39==Be it so she will not here before your Grace
==40==Consent to marry with Demetrius,
==41==I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:
==42==As she is mine, I may dispose of her;
==43==Which shall be either to this gentleman,
==44==Or to her death, according to our law
==45==Immediately provided in that case.

**THE.**
==46==What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.
==47==To you your father should be as a god;
==48==One that compos’d your beauties; yea, and one
==49==To whom you are but as a form in wax,
==50==By him imprinted, and within his power,
==51==To leave the figure, or disfigure it.
==52==Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

**HER.**
==53==So is Lysander.

**THE.**
==53==        In himself he is;
==54==But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,
==55==The other must be held the worthier.

**HER.**
==56==I would my father look’d but with my eyes.

**THE.**
==57==Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

**HER.**
==58==I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.
==59==I know not by what power I am made bold,
==60==Nor how it may concern my modesty,
==61==In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
==62==But I beseech your Grace that I may know
==63==The worst that may befall me in this case,
==64==If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

**THE.**
==65==Either to die the death, or to abjure
==66==Forever the society of men.
==67==Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,
==68==Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
==69==Whether (if you yield not to your father’s choice) 
==70==You can endure the livery of a nun,
==71==For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,
==72==To live a barren sister all your life,
==73==Chaunting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
==74==Thrice blessed they that master so their blood
==75==To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
==76==But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d,
==77==Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
==78==Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.

**HER.**
==79==So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
==80==Ere I will yield my virgin patent up
==81==Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
==82==My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

**THE.**
==83==Take time to pause, and by the next new moon⁠—
==84==The sealing-day betwixt my love and me
==85==For everlasting bond of fellowship⁠—
==86==Upon that day either prepare to die
==87==For disobedience to your father’s will,
==88==Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,
==89==Or on Diana’s altar to protest
==90==For aye austerity and single life.

**DEM.**
==91==Relent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yield
==92==Thy crazed title to my certain right.

**LYS.**
==93==You have her father’s love, Demetrius,
==94==Let me have Hermia’s; do you marry him.

**EGE.**
==95==Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;
==96==And what is mine, my love shall render him.
==97==And she is mine, and all my right of her
==98==I do estate unto Demetrius.

**LYS.**
==99==I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,
==100==As well possess’d; my love is more than his;
==101==My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d
==102==(If not with vantage) as Demetrius’;
==103==And (which is more than all these boasts can be) 
==104==I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.
==105==Why should not I then prosecute my right?
==106==Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,
==107==Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,
==108==And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
==109==Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
==110==Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

**THE.**
==111==I must confess that I have heard so much,
==112==And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
==113==But, being over-full of self-affairs,
==114==My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come,
==115==And come, Egeus, you shall go with me;
==116==I have some private schooling for you both.
==117==For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
==118==To fit your fancies to your father’s will;
==119==Or else the law of Athens yields you up
==120==(Which by no means we may extenuate) 
==121==To death, or to a vow of single life.
==122==Come, my Hippolyta; what cheer, my love?
==123==Demetrius and Egeus, go along;
==124==I must employ you in some business
==125==Against our nuptial, and confer with you
==126==Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

**EGE.**
==127==With duty and desire we follow you.

*Exeunt. Manent Lysander and Hermia.*

**LYS.**
==128==How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?
==129==How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

**HER.**
==130==Belike for want of rain; which I could well
==131==Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

**LYS.**
==132==Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,
==133==Could ever hear by tale or history,
==134==The course of true love never did run smooth;
==135==But either it was different in blood⁠—

**HER.**
==136==O cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.

**LYS.**
==137==Or else misgraffed in respect of years⁠—

**HER.**
==138==O spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.

**LYS.**
==139==Or else it stood upon the choice of friends⁠—

**HER.**
==140==O hell, to choose love by another’s eyes!

**LYS.**
==141==Or if there were a sympathy in choice,
==142==War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
==143==Making it momentany as a sound,
==144==Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,
==145==Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
==146==That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth;
==147==And ere a man hath power to say “Behold!”
==148==The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
==149==So quick bright things come to confusion.

**HER.**
==150==If then true lovers have been ever cross’d,
==151==It stands as an edict in destiny.
==152==Then let us teach our trial patience,
==153==Because it is a customary cross,
==154==As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
==155==Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.

**LYS.**
==156==A good persuasion; therefore hear me, Hermia:
==157==I have a widow aunt, a dowager,
==158==Of great revenue, and she hath no child.
==159==From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
==160==And she respects me as her only son.
==161==There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
==162==And to that place the sharp Athenian law
==163==Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, then
==164==Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;
==165==And in the wood, a league without the town
==166==(Where I did meet thee once with Helena
==167==To do observance to a morn of May),
==168==There will I stay for thee.

**HER.**
==168==              My good Lysander,
==169==I swear to thee, by Cupid’s strongest bow,
==170==By his best arrow with the golden head,
==171==By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,
==172==By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
==173==And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen
==174==When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
==175==By all the vows that ever men have broke
==176==(In number more than ever women spoke),
==177==In that same place thou hast appointed me
==178==Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.

**LYS.**
==179==Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

*Enter Helena.*

**HER.**
==180==God speed fair Helena! Whither away?

**HEL.**
==181==Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.
==182==Demetrius loves your fair, O happy fair!
==183==Your eyes are lodestars, and your tongue’s sweet air
==184==More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear
==185==When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
==186==Sickness is catching; O, were favor so,
==187==Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
==188==My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
==189==My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.
==190==Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
==191==The rest I’ll give to be to you translated.
==192==O, teach me how you look, and with what art
==193==You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart.

**HER.**
==194==I frown upon him; yet he loves me still.

**HEL.**
==195==O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

**HER.**
==196==I give him curses; yet he gives me love.

**HEL.**
==197==O that my prayers could such affection move!

**HER.**
==198==The more I hate, the more he follows me.

**HEL.**
==199==The more I love, the more he hateth me.

**HER.**
==200==His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

**HEL.**
==201==None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!

**HER.**
==202==Take comfort; he no more shall see my face;
==203==Lysander and myself will fly this place.
==204==Before the time I did Lysander see,
==205==Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me;
==206==O then, what graces in my love do dwell,
==207==That he hath turn’d a heaven unto a hell!

**LYS.**
==208==Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
==209==Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
==210==Her silver visage in the wat’ry glass,
==211==Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass
==212==(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),
==213==Through Athens gates have we devis’d to steal.

**HER.**
==214==And in the wood, where often you and I
==215==Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,
==216==Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
==217==There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
==218==And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
==219==To seek new friends and stranger companies.
==220==Farewell, sweet playfellow, pray thou for us;
==221==And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
==222==Keep word, Lysander; we must starve our sight
==223==From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.

**LYS.**
==224==I will, my Hermia.
*(Exit Hermia.)*
==224==           Helena, *adieu*:
==225==As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!

*Exit Lysander.*

**HEL.**
==226==How happy some o’er other some can be!
==227==Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
==228==But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
==229==He will not know what all but he do know;
==230==And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,
==231==So I, admiring of his qualities.
==232==Things base and vile, holding no quantity,
==233==Love can transpose to form and dignity.
==234==Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;
==235==And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.
==236==Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgment taste;
==237==Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste;
==238==And therefore is Love said to be a child,
==239==Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d.
==240==As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
==241==So the boy Love is perjur’d every where;
==242==For ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,
==243==He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;
==244==And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
==245==So he dissolv’d, and show’rs of oaths did melt.
==246==I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight;
==247==Then to the wood will he tomorrow night
==248==Pursue her; and for this intelligence
==249==If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.
==250==But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
==251==To have his sight thither and back again.

*Exit.*
