## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the woods near Athens.*

*Enter Titania, Queen of Fairies, with her Train.*

**TITA.**
==1==Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
==2==Then, for the third part of a minute, hence,
==3==Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
==4==Some war with rere-mice for their leathren wings
==5==To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
==6==The clamorous owl, that nightly hoots and wonders
==7==At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
==8==Then to your offices, and let me rest.

*Fairies sing.*

**1. FAIRY.**
==9==*You spotted snakes with double tongue,*
==10==*Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen,*
==11==*Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,*
==12==*Come not near our fairy queen.*

**CHORUS.**
==13==*Philomele, with melody,*
==14==*Sing in our sweet lullaby,*
==15==*Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby.*
==16==*Never harm,*
==17==*Nor spell, nor charm,*
==18==*Come our lovely lady nigh.*
==19==*So good night, with lullaby.*

**1. FAIRY.**
==20==*Weaving spiders, come not here;*
==21==*Hence, you long-legg’d spinners, hence!*
==22==*Beetles black, approach not near;*
==23==*Worm nor snail, do no offense.*

**CHORUS.**
==24==*Philomele, with melody, etc.*

**2. FAIRY.**
==25==*Hence, away! Now all is well.*
==26==*One aloof stand sentinel.*

*Exeunt Fairies. Titania sleeps.*

*Enter Oberon and squeezes the flower on Titania’s eyelids.*

**OBE.**
==27==*What thou seest when thou dost wake,*
==28==*Do it for thy true-love take;*
==29==*Love and languish for his sake.*
==30==*Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,*
==31==*Pard, or boar with bristled hair,*
==32==*In thy eye that shall appear*
==33==*When thou wak’st, it is thy dear:*
==34==*Wake when some vile thing is near.*

*Exit.*

*Enter Lysander and Hermia.*

**LYS.**
==35==Fair love, you faint with wand’ring in the wood;
==36==And to speak troth I have forgot our way.
==37==We’ll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
==38==And tarry for the comfort of the day.

**HER.**
==39==Be’t so, Lysander. Find you out a bed;
==40==For I upon this bank will rest my head.

**LYS.**
==41==One turf shall serve as pillow for us both,
==42==One heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.

**HER.**
==43==Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
==44==Lie further off yet; do not lie so near.

**LYS.**
==45==O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
==46==Love takes the meaning in love’s conference:
==47==I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit,
==48==So that but one heart we can make of it;
==49==Two bosoms interchained with an oath,
==50==So then two bosoms and a single troth.
==51==Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
==52==For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

**HER.**
==53==Lysander riddles very prettily.
==54==Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
==55==If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
==56==But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy,
==57==Lie further off, in humane modesty;
==58==Such separation as may well be said
==59==Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
==60==So far be distant; and good night, sweet friend.
==61==Thy love ne’er alter till thy sweet life end!

**LYS.**
==62==Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I,
==63==And then end life when I end loyalty!
==64==Here is my bed; sleep give thee all his rest!

**HER.**
==65==With half that wish the wisher’s eyes be press’d!

*They sleep.*

*Enter Puck.*

**PUCK.**
==66==*Through the forest have I gone,*
==67==*But Athenian found I none,*
==68==*On whose eyes I might approve*
==69==*This flower’s force in stirring love.*
==70==*Night and silence—Who is here?*
==71==*Weeds of Athens he doth wear:*
==72==*This is he, my master said,*
==73==*Despised the Athenian maid;*
==74==*And here the maiden, sleeping sound,*
==75==*On the dank and dirty ground.*
==76==*Pretty soul, she durst not lie*
==77==*Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.*
==78==*Churl, upon thy eyes I throw*
==79==*All the power this charm doth owe.*
==80==*When thou wak’st, let love forbid*
==81==*Sleep his seat on thy eyelid.*
==82==*So awake when I am gone,*
==83==*For I must now to Oberon.*

*Exit.*

*Enter Demetrius and Helena, running.*

**HEL.**
==84==Stay—though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.

**DEM.**
==85==I charge thee hence, and do not haunt me thus.

**HEL.**
==86==O, wilt thou darkling leave me? Do not so.

**DEM.**
==87==Stay, on thy peril; I alone will go.

*Exit.*

**HEL.**
==88==O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
==89==The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
==90==Happy is Hermia, wheresoe’er she lies,
==91==For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
==92==How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears;
==93==If so, my eyes are oft’ner wash’d than hers.
==94==No, no; I am as ugly as a bear;
==95==For beasts that meet me run away for fear.
==96==Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
==97==Do, as a monster, fly my presence thus.
==98==What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
==99==Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne!
==100==But who is here? Lysander! On the ground?
==101==Dead, or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
==102==Lysander, if you live, good sir, awake.

**LYS.**
*(Awaking.)*
==103==And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
==104==Transparent Helena, nature shows art,
==105==That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
==106==Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
==107==Is that vile name to perish on my sword!

**HEL.**
==108==Do not say so, Lysander, say not so.
==109==What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
==110==Yet Hermia still loves you; then be content.

**LYS.**
==111==Content with Hermia? No; I do repent
==112==The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
==113==Not Hermia, but Helena I love.
==114==Who will not change a raven for a dove?
==115==The will of man is by his reason sway’d;
==116==And reason says you are the worthier maid.
==117==Things growing are not ripe until their season,
==118==So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
==119==And touching now the point of human skill,
==120==Reason becomes the marshal to my will,
==121==And leads me to your eyes, where I o’erlook
==122==Love’s stories written in Love’s richest book.

**HEL.**
==123==Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
==124==When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
==125==Is’t not enough, is’t not enough, young man,
==126==That I did never, no, nor never can,
==127==Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius’ eye,
==128==But you must flout my insufficiency?
==129==Good troth, you do me wrong (good sooth, you do) 
==130==In such disdainful manner me to woo.
==131==But fare you well; perforce I must confess
==132==I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
==133==O that a lady, of one man refus’d,
==134==Should of another therefore be abus’d!

*Exit.*

**LYS.**
==135==She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there,
==136==And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
==137==For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
==138==The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
==139==Or as the heresies that men do leave
==140==Are hated most of those they did deceive,
==141==So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
==142==Of all be hated, but the most of me!
==143==And, all my powers, address your love and might
==144==To honor Helen and to be her knight.

*Exit.*

**HER.**
*(Starting up.)*
==145==Help me, Lysander, help me! Do thy best
==146==To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
==147==Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here!
==148==Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.
==149==Methought a serpent ate my heart away,
==150==And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.
==151==Lysander! What, remov’d? Lysander! Lord!
==152==What, out of hearing gone? No sound, no word?
==153==Alack, where are you? Speak, and if you hear;
==154==Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
==155==No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh:
==156==Either death, or you, I’ll find immediately.

*Exit.*
