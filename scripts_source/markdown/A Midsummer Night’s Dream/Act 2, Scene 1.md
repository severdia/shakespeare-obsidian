## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*In the woods near Athens.*

*Enter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow (Puck) at another.*

**PUCK.**
==1== How now, spirit, whither wander you?

**FAIRY.**
==2== *Over hill, over dale,*
==3== *Thorough bush, thorough brier,*
==4== *Over park, over pale,*
==5== *Thorough flood, thorough fire,*
==6== *I do wander every where,*
==7== *Swifter than the moon’s sphere;*
==8== *And I serve the Fairy Queen,*
==9== *To dew her orbs upon the green.*
==10== *The cowslips tall her pensioners be,*
==11== *In their gold coats spots you see:*
==12== *Those be rubies, fairy favors,*
==13== *In those freckles live their savors.*
==14== I must go seek some dewdrops here,
==15== And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.
==16== Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone.
==17== Our Queen and all her elves come here anon.

**PUCK.**
==18== The King doth keep his revels here tonight;
==19== Take heed the Queen come not within his sight;
==20== For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
==21== Because that she as her attendant hath
==22== A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;
==23== She never had so sweet a changeling.
==24== And jealous Oberon would have the child
==25== Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
==26== But she, perforce, withholds the loved boy,
==27== Crowns him with flowers, and makes him all her joy.
==28== And now they never meet in grove or green,
==29== By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
==30== But they do square, that all their elves for fear
==31== Creep into acorn-cups, and hide them there.

**FAIRY.**
==32== Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
==33== Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
==34== Call’d Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he
==35== That frights the maidens of the villagery,
==36== Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern,
==37== And bootless make the breathless huswife churn,
==38== And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,
==39== Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
==40== Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
==41== You do their work, and they shall have good luck.
==42== Are not you he?

**PUCK.**
==42==         Thou speakest aright;
==43== I am that merry wanderer of the night.
==44== I jest to Oberon and make him smile
==45== When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
==46== Neighing in likeness of a filly foal;
==47== And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl,
==48== In very likeness of a roasted crab,
==49== And when she drinks, against her lips I bob,
==50== And on her withered dewlop pour the ale.
==51== The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
==52== Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
==53== Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
==54== And “tailor” cries, and falls into a cough;
==55== And then the whole quire hold their hips and loff,
==56== And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and swear
==57== A merrier hour was never wasted there.
==58== But room, fairy! Here comes Oberon.

**FAIRY.**
==59== And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

*Enter the King of Fairies Oberon at one door with his Train, and the Queen Titania at another with hers.*

**OBE.**
==60== Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.

**TITA.**
==61== What, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence⁠—
==62== I have forsworn his bed and company.

**OBE.**
==63== Tarry, rash wanton! Am not I thy lord?

**TITA.**
==64== Then I must be thy lady; but I know
==65== When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
==66== And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
==67== Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love,
==68== To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here
==69== Come from the farthest steep of India?
==70== But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
==71== Your buskin’d mistress, and your warrior love,
==72== To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
==73== To give their bed joy and prosperity.

**OBE.**
==74== How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
==75== Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
==76== Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
==77== Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night
==78== From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
==79== And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,
==80== With Ariadne, and Antiopa?

**TITA.**
==81== These are the forgeries of jealousy;
==82== And never, since the middle summer’s spring,
==83== Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,
==84== By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
==85== Or in the beached margent of the sea,
==86== To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
==87== But with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.
==88== Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
==89== As in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea
==90== Contagious fogs; which, falling in the land,
==91== Hath every pelting river made so proud
==92== That they have overborne their continents.
==93== The ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,
==94== The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
==95== Hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard.
==96== The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
==97== And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
==98== The nine men’s morris is fill’d up with mud,
==99== And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,
==100== For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.
==101== The human mortals want their winter here;
==102== No night is now with hymn or carol blest.
==103== Therefore the moon (the governess of floods),
==104== Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
==105== That rheumatic diseases do abound.
==106== And thorough this distemperature, we see
==107== The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
==108== Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
==109== And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown
==110== An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
==111== Is, as in mockery, set; the spring, the summer,
==112== The childing autumn, angry winter, change
==113== Their wonted liveries; and the mazed world,
==114== By their increase, now knows not which is which.
==115== And this same progeny of evils comes
==116== From our debate, from our dissension;
==117== We are their parents and original.

**OBE.**
==118== Do you amend it then; it lies in you.
==119== Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
==120== I do but beg a little changeling boy,
==121== To be my henchman.

**TITA.**
==121==            Set your heart at rest;
==122== The fairy land buys not the child of me.
==123== His mother was a vot’ress of my order,
==124== And in the spiced Indian air, by night,
==125== Full often hath she gossip’d by my side,
==126== And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,
==127== Marking th’ embarked traders on the flood;
==128== When we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive
==129== And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
==130== Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,
==131== Following (her womb then rich with my young squire) 
==132== Would imitate, and sail upon the land
==133== To fetch me trifles, and return again,
==134== As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
==135== But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,
==136== And for her sake do I rear up her boy;
==137== And for her sake I will not part with him.

**OBE.**
==138== How long within this wood intend you stay?

**TITA.**
==139== Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day.
==140== If you will patiently dance in our round,
==141== And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
==142== If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.

**OBE.**
==143== Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.

**TITA.**
==144== Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
==145== We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.

*Exeunt Titania and her Train.*

**OBE.**
==146== Well; go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove
==147== Till I torment thee for this injury.
==148== My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest
==149== Since once I sat upon a promontory,
==150== And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back
==151== Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
==152== That the rude sea grew civil at her song,
==153== And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
==154== To hear the sea-maid’s music?

**PUCK.**
==154==                 I remember.

**OBE.**
==155== That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),
==156== Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
==157== Cupid all arm’d. A certain aim he took
==158== At a fair vestal throned by the west,
==159== And loos’d his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
==160== As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
==161== But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft
==162== Quench’d in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon,
==163== And the imperial vot’ress passed on,
==164== In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
==165== Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell.
==166== It fell upon a little western flower,
==167== Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,
==168== And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
==169== Fetch me that flow’r; the herb I showed thee once.
==170== The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid
==171== Will make or man or woman madly dote
==172== Upon the next live creature that it sees.
==173== Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again
==174== Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

**PUCK.**
==175== I’ll put a girdle round about the earth
==176== In forty minutes.

*Exit.*

**OBE.**
==176==            Having once this juice,
==177== I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,
==178== And drop the liquor of it in her eyes;
==179== The next thing then she waking looks upon
==180== (Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
==181== On meddling monkey, or on busy ape),
==182== She shall pursue it with the soul of love.
==183== And ere I take this charm from off her sight
==184== (As I can take it with another herb),
==185== I’ll make her render up her page to me.
==186== But who comes here? I am invisible,
==187== And I will overhear their conference.

*Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.*

**DEM.**
==188== I love thee not; therefore pursue me not.
==189== Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
==190== The one I’ll slay; the other slayeth me.
==191== Thou toldst me they were stol’n unto this wood;
==192== And here am I, and wode within this wood,
==193== Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
==194== Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.

**HEL.**
==195== You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
==196== But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
==197== Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,
==198== And I shall have no power to follow you.

**DEM.**
==199== Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?
==200== Or rather do I not in plainest truth
==201== Tell you I do not nor I cannot love you?

**HEL.**
==202== And even for that do I love you the more;
==203== I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
==204== The more you beat me, I will fawn on you.
==205== Use me but as your spaniel; spurn me, strike me,
==206== Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
==207== Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
==208== What worser place can I beg in your love
==209== (And yet a place of high respect with me) 
==210== Than to be used as you use your dog?

**DEM.**
==211== Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,
==212== For I am sick when I do look on thee.

**HEL.**
==213== And I am sick when I look not on you.

**DEM.**
==214== You do impeach your modesty too much,
==215== To leave the city and commit yourself
==216== Into the hands of one that loves you not;
==217== To trust the opportunity of night,
==218== And the ill counsel of a desert place,
==219== With the rich worth of your virginity.

**HEL.**
==220== Your virtue is my privilege. For that
==221== It is not night when I do see your face,
==222== Therefore I think I am not in the night,
==223== Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
==224== For you in my respect are all the world.
==225== Then how can it be said I am alone,
==226== When all the world is here to look on me?

**DEM.**
==227== I’ll run from thee, and hide me in the brakes,
==228== And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.

**HEL.**
==229== The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
==230== Run when you will; the story shall be chang’d:
==231== Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
==232== The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
==233== Makes speed to catch the tiger—bootless speed,
==234== When cowardice pursues and valor flies.

**DEM.**
==235== I will not stay thy questions. Let me go;
==236== Or if thou follow me, do not believe
==237== But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.

**HEL.**
==238== Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
==239== You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
==240== Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.
==241== We cannot fight for love, as men may do.
==242== We should be woo’d, and were not made to woo.
*(Exit Demetrius.)*
==243== I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
==244== To die upon the hand I love so well.

*Exit.*

**OBE.**
==245== Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,
==246== Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.
*(Enter Puck.)*
==247== Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.

**PUCK.**
==248== Ay, there it is.

**OBE.**
==248==         I pray thee give it me.
==249== I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
==250== Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
==251== Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
==252== With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine;
==253== There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
==254== Lull’d in these flowers with dances and delight;
==255== And there the snake throws her enamell’d skin,
==256== Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in;
==257== And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes,
==258== And make her full of hateful fantasies.
==259== Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
==260== A sweet Athenian lady is in love
==261== With a disdainful youth; anoint his eyes,
==262== But do it when the next thing he espies
==263== May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man
==264== By the Athenian garments he hath on.
==265== Effect it with some care, that he may prove
==266== More fond on her than she upon her love;
==267== And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.

**PUCK.**
==268== Fear not, my lord! Your servant shall do so.

*Exeunt.*
