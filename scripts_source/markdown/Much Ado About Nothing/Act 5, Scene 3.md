## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Messina. Inside a church.*

*Enter Claudio, Prince Don Pedro, and three or four with tapers, including Balthasar.*

**CLAUD.**
==1==Is this the monument of Leonato?

**LORD.**
==2==It is, my lord.

**CLAUD.**
*(Reading out of a scroll.)*
*(Epitaph)*
==3==*“Done to death by slanderous tongues*
==4==    *Was the Hero that here lies.*
==5==*Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,*
==6==    *Gives her fame which never dies.*
==7==*So the life that died with shame*
==8==*Lives in death with glorious fame.”*
==9==*Hang thou there upon the tomb,*
*(Hangs up the scroll.)*
==10==    Praising her when I am dumb.
==11==Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.

**BALTH.**
*(Song.)*
==12== *Pardon, goddess of the night,*
==13== *Those that slew thy virgin knight,*
==14== *For the which, with songs of woe,*
==15== *Round about her tomb they go.*
==16==    *Midnight, assist our moan,*
==17==    *Help us to sigh and groan,*
==18==        *Heavily, heavily.*
==19==    *Graves, yawn and yield your dead,*
==20==    *Till death be uttered,*
==21==        *Heavily, heavily.*

**CLAUD.**
==22==Now, unto thy bones good night!
==23==Yearly will I do this rite.

**D. PEDRO.**
==24==Good morrow, masters, put your torches out.
==25==The wolves have preyed, and look, the gentle day,
==26==Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
==27==Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
==28==Thanks to you all, and leave us. Fare you well.

**CLAUD.**
==29==Good morrow, masters—each his several way.

**D. PEDRO.**
==30==Come let us hence, and put on other weeds,
==31==And then to Leonato’s we will go.

**CLAUD.**
==32==And Hymen now with luckier issue speed’s
==33==Than this for whom we rend’red up this woe.

*Exeunt.*
