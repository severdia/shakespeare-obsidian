## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*A room in Leonato’s house.*

*Enter Leonato and an old man Antonio, brother to Leonato, meeting.*

**LEON.**
How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music?

**ANT.**
He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.

**LEON.**
Are they good?

**ANT.**
As the event stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleach’d alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine. The Prince discover’d to Claudio that he lov’d my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top, and instantly break with you of it.

**LEON.**
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?

**ANT.**
A good sharp fellow. I will send for him, and question him yourself.

**LEON.**
No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself; but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepar’d for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
*(Several persons cross the stage.)*
Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you mercy, friend, go you with me, and I will use your skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.

*Exeunt.*
