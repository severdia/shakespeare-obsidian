## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Another room in Leonato’s house.*

*Enter Leonato and the Constable Dogberry and the Headborough Verges.*

**LEON.**
==1== What would you with me, honest neighbor?

**DOG.**
==2== Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly.

**LEON.**
==3== Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time with me.

**DOG.**
==4== Marry, this it is, sir.

**VERG.**
==5== Yes, in truth it is, sir.

**LEON.**
==6== What is it, my good friends?

**DOG.**
==7== Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter; an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were, but in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.

**VERG.**
==8== Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living, that is an old man, and no honester than I.

**DOG.**
==9== Comparisons are odorous—*palabras*, neighbor Verges.

**LEON.**
==10== Neighbors, you are tedious.

**DOG.**
==11== It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke’s officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.

**LEON.**
==12== All thy tediousness on me, ah?

**DOG.**
==13== Yea, and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.

**VERG.**
==14== And so am I.

**LEON.**
==15== I would fain know what you have to say.

**VERG.**
==16== Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your worship’s presence, ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.

**DOG.**
==17== A good old man, sir, he will be talking; as they say, “When the age is in, the wit is out.” God help us, it is a world to see! Well said, i’ faith, neighbor Verges. Well, God’s a good man; and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’ faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be worshipp’d; all men are not alike, alas, good neighbor!

**LEON.**
==18== Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.

**DOG.**
==19== Gifts that God gives.

**LEON.**
==20== I must leave you.

**DOG.**
==21== One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examin’d before your worship.

**LEON.**
==22== Take their examination yourself, and bring it me. I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.

**DOG.**
==23== It shall be suffigance.

**LEON.**
==24== Drink some wine ere you go; fare you well.

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
==25== My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to her husband.

**LEON.**
==26== I’ll wait upon them, I am ready.

*Exeunt Leonato and Messenger.*

**DOG.**
==27== Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole, bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail. We are now to examination these men.

**VERG.**
==28== And we must do it wisely.

**DOG.**
==29== We will spare for no wit, I warrant you. Here’s that shall drive some of them to a non-come; only get the learned writer to set down our excommunication, and meet me at the jail.

*Exeunt.*
