## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]]

*A room in Leonato’s house.*

*Enter Leonato, Benedick, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, old man Antonio, Friar Francis, Hero.*

**FRIAR.**
==1==Did I not tell you she was innocent?

**LEON.**
==2==So are the Prince and Claudio, who accus’d her
==3==Upon the error that you heard debated.
==4==But Margaret was in some fault for this,
==5==Although against her will, as it appears
==6==In the true course of all the question.

**ANT.**
==7==Well, I am glad that all things sorts so well.

**BENE.**
==8==And so am I, being else by faith enforc’d
==9==To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.

**LEON.**
==10==Well, daughter, and you gentlewomen all,
==11==Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
==12==And when I send for you, come hither masked.
==13==The Prince and Claudio promis’d by this hour
==14==To visit me. You know your office, brother:
==15==You must be father to your brother’s daughter,
==16==And give her to young Claudio.

*Exeunt Ladies.*

**ANT.**
==17==Which I will do with confirm’d countenance.

**BENE.**
==18==Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

**FRIAR.**
==19==To do what, *signior*?

**BENE.**
==20==To bind me, or undo me—one of them.
==21==*Signior* Leonato, truth it is, good *signior*,
==22==Your niece regards me with an eye of favor.

**LEON.**
==23==That eye my daughter lent her, ’tis most true.

**BENE.**
==24==And I do with an eye of love requite her.

**LEON.**
==25==The sight whereof I think you had from me,
==26==From Claudio, and the Prince. But what’s your will?

**BENE.**
==27==Your answer, sir, is enigmatical,
==28==But for my will, my will is your good will
==29==May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin’d
==30==In the state of honorable marriage,
==31==In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.

**LEON.**
==32==My heart is with your liking.

**FRIAR.**
==32==                  And my help.
==33==Here comes the Prince and Claudio.

*Enter Prince Don Pedro and Claudio and two or three other.*

**D. PEDRO.**
==34==Good morrow to this fair assembly.

**LEON.**
==35==Good morrow, Prince; good morrow, Claudio;
==36==We here attend you. Are you yet determined
==37==Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?

**CLAUD.**
==38==I’ll hold my mind were she an Ethiope.

**LEON.**
==39==Call her forth, brother, here’s the friar ready.

*Exit Antonio.*

**D. PEDRO.**
==40==Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what’s the matter,
==41==That you have such a February face,
==42==So full of frost, of storm, and cloudiness?

**CLAUD.**
==43==I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
==44==Tush, fear not, man, we’ll tip thy horns with gold,
==45==And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
==46==As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
==47==When he would play the noble beast in love.

**BENE.**
==48==Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low,
==49==And some such strange bull leapt your father’s cow,
==50==And got a calf in that same noble feat
==51==Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.

*Enter Brother Antonio, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret, Ursula, the ladies masked.*

**CLAUD.**
==52==For this I owe you: here comes other reck’nings.
==53==Which is the lady I must seize upon?

**ANT.**
==54==This same is she, and I do give you her.

**CLAUD.**
==55==Why then she’s mine. Sweet, let me see your face.

**LEON.**
==56==No, that you shall not till you take her hand,
==57==Before this friar, and swear to marry her.

**CLAUD.**
==58==Give me your hand before this holy friar⁠—
==59==I am your husband if you like of me.

**HERO.**
*(Unmasking.)*
==60==And when I liv’d, I was your other wife,
==61==And when you lov’d, you were my other husband.

**CLAUD.**
==62==Another Hero!

**HERO.**
==62==        Nothing certainer:
==63==One Hero died defil’d, but I do live,
==64==And surely as I live, I am a maid.

**D. PEDRO.**
==65==The former Hero! Hero that is dead!

**LEON.**
==66==She died, my lord, but whiles her slander liv’d.

**FRIAR.**
==67==All this amazement can I qualify,
==68==When after that the holy rites are ended,
==69==I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death.
==70==Mean time let wonder seem familiar,
==71==And to the chapel let us presently.

**BENE.**
==72==Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?

**BEAT.**
*(Unmasking.)*
==73==I answer to that name. What is your will?

**BENE.**
==74==Do not you love me?

**BEAT.**
==74==           Why, no, no more than reason.

**BENE.**
==75==Why then your uncle and the Prince and Claudio
==76==Have been deceived. They swore you did.

**BEAT.**
==77==Do not you love me?

**BENE.**
==77==           Troth, no, no more than reason.

**BEAT.**
==78==Why then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula
==79==Are much deceiv’d, for they did swear you did.

**BENE.**
==80==They swore that you were almost sick for me.

**BEAT.**
==81==They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.

**BENE.**
==82==’Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?

**BEAT.**
==83==No, truly, but in friendly recompense.

**LEON.**
==84==Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.

**CLAUD.**
==85==And I’ll be sworn upon’t that he loves her,
==86==For here’s a paper written in his hand,
==87==A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
==88==Fashion’d to Beatrice.

**HERO.**
==88==           And here’s another
==89==Writ in my cousin’s hand, stol’n from her pocket,
==90==Containing her affection unto Benedick.

**BENE.**
==91==A miracle! Here’s our own hands against our hearts. Come, I will have thee, but by this light, I take thee for pity.

**BEAT.**
==92==I would not deny you, but by this good day, I yield upon great persuasion, and partly to save your life, for I was told you were in a consumption.

**BENE.**
==93==Peace, I will stop your mouth.

*Kissing her.*

**D. PEDRO.**
==94==How dost thou, Benedick the married man?

**BENE.**
==95==I’ll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No, if a man will be beaten with brains, ’a shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruis’d, and love my cousin.

**CLAUD.**
==96==I had well hop’d thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgell’d thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.

**BENE.**
==97==Come, come, we are friends. Let’s have a dance ere we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives’ heels.

**LEON.**
==98==We’ll have dancing afterward.

**BENE.**
==99==First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince, thou art sad, get thee a wife, get thee a wife. There is no staff more reverent than one tipp’d with horn.

*Enter Messenger.*

**MESS.**
==100==My lord, your brother John is ta’en in flight,
==101==And brought with armed men back to Messina.

**BENE.**
==102==Think not on him till tomorrow. I’ll devise thee brave punishments for him. Strike up, pipers.

*Dance.*

*Exeunt.*
