## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Leonato’s garden.*

*Enter Hero and two gentlewomen, Margaret and Ursula.*

**HERO.**
==1==Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor,
==2==There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
==3==Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.
==4==Whisper her ear, and tell her I and Ursley
==5==Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse
==6==Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,
==7==And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
==8==Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun,
==9==Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites
==10==Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
==11==Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her,
==12==To listen our propose. This is thy office;
==13==Bear thee well in it, and leave us alone.

**MARG.**
==14==I’ll make her come, I warrant you, presently.

*Exit.*

**HERO.**
==15==Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
==16==As we do trace this alley up and down,
==17==Our talk must only be of Benedick.
==18==When I do name him, let it be thy part
==19==To praise him more than ever man did merit.
==20==My talk to thee must be how Benedick
==21==Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
==22==Is little Cupid’s crafty arrow made,
==23==That only wounds by hearsay.
*(Enter Beatrice behind.)*
==23==                Now begin,
==24==For look where Beatrice like a lapwing runs
==25==Close by the ground, to hear our conference.

**URS.**
==26==The pleasant’st angling is to see the fish
==27==Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
==28==And greedily devour the treacherous bait;
==29==So angle we for Beatrice, who even now
==30==Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
==31==Fear you not my part of the dialogue.

**HERO.**
==32==Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
==33==Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
*(They advance to the bower.)*
==34==No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful,
==35==I know her spirits are as coy and wild
==36==As haggards of the rock.

**URS.**
==36==              But are you sure
==37==That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?

**HERO.**
==38==So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord.

**URS.**
==39==And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

**HERO.**
==40==They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,
==41==But I persuaded them, if they lov’d Benedick,
==42==To wish him wrestle with affection,
==43==And never to let Beatrice know of it.

**URS.**
==44==Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
==45==Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
==46==As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?

**HERO.**
==47==O god of love! I know he doth deserve
==48==As much as may be yielded to a man;
==49==But nature never fram’d a woman’s heart
==50==Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.
==51==Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
==52==Misprising what they look on, and her wit
==53==Values itself so highly that to her
==54==All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,
==55==Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
==56==She is so self-endeared.

**URS.**
==56==              Sure I think so,
==57==And therefore certainly it were not good
==58==She knew his love, lest she’ll make sport at it.

**HERO.**
==59==Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
==60==How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d,
==61==But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac’d,
==62==She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
==63==If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,
==64==Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
==65==If low, an agot very vilely cut;
==66==If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
==67==If silent, why, a block moved with none.
==68==So turns she every man the wrong side out,
==69==And never gives to truth and virtue that
==70==Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

**URS.**
==71==Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.

**HERO.**
==72==No, not to be so odd, and from all fashions,
==73==As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.
==74==But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
==75==She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
==76==Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
==77==Therefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire,
==78==Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.
==79==It were a better death than die with mocks,
==80==Which is as bad as die with tickling.

**URS.**
==81==Yet tell her of it, hear what she will say.

**HERO.**
==82==No, rather I will go to Benedick,
==83==And counsel him to fight against his passion,
==84==And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders
==85==To stain my cousin with. One doth not know
==86==How much an ill word may empoison liking.

**URS.**
==87==O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
==88==She cannot be so much without true judgment⁠—
==89==Having so swift and excellent a wit
==90==As she is priz’d to have—as to refuse
==91==So rare a gentleman as *Signior* Benedick.

**HERO.**
==92==He is the only man of Italy,
==93==Always excepted my dear Claudio.

**URS.**
==94==I pray you be not angry with me, madam,
==95==Speaking my fancy: *Signior* Benedick,
==96==For shape, for bearing, argument, and valor,
==97==Goes foremost in report through Italy.

**HERO.**
==98==Indeed he hath an excellent good name.

**URS.**
==99==His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
==100==When are you married, madam?

**HERO.**
==101==Why, every day tomorrow. Come go in,
==102==I’ll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
==103==Which is the best to furnish me tomorrow.

**URS.**
*(Aside.)*
==104==She’s limed, I warrant you. We have caught her, madam.

**HERO.**
*(Aside.)*
==105==If it prove so, then loving goes by haps:
==106==Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.

*Exeunt Hero and Ursula.*

**BEAT.**
*(Coming forward.)*
==107==What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
==108==Stand I condemn’d for pride and scorn so much?
==109==Contempt, farewell, and maiden pride, *adieu*!
==110==No glory lives behind the back of such.
==111==And, Benedick, love on, I will requite thee,
==112==Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand.
==113==If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
==114==To bind our loves up in a holy band;
==115==For others say thou dost deserve, and I
==116==Believe it better than reportingly.

*Exit.*
