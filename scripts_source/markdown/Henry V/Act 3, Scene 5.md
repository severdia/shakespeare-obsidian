## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 6|Act 3, Scene 6 →]]

*Rouen. Another room in the French King’s palace.*

*Enter the King of France, the Dauphin, the Duke of Britain, the Constable of France, and others.*

**FR. KING.**
==1== ’Tis certain he hath pass’d the river Somme.

**CON.**
==2== And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
==3== Let us not live in France; let us quit all,
==4== And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.

**DAU.**
==5== *O Dieu vivant!* Shall a few sprays of us,
==6== The emptying of our fathers’ luxury,
==7== Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
==8== Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds
==9== And overlook their grafters?

**BRIT.**
==10== Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!
==11== *Mort Dieu, ma vie!* If they march along
==12== Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,
==13== To buy a slobb’ry and a dirty farm
==14== In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.

**CON.**
==15== *Dieu de batailles!* Where have they this mettle?
==16== Is not their climate foggy, raw, and dull,
==17== On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
==18== Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
==19== A drench for sur-rein’d jades, their barley-broth,
==20== Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
==21== And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
==22== Seem frosty? O, for honor of our land,
==23== Let us not hang like roping icicles
==24== Upon our houses’ thatch, whiles a more frosty people
==25== Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
==26== Poor we call them in their native lords!

**DAU.**
==27== By faith and honor,
==28== Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
==29== Our mettle is bred out, and they will give
==30== Their bodies to the lust of English youth
==31== To new-store France with bastard warriors.

**BRIT.**
==32== They bid us to the English dancing-schools,
==33== And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos,
==34== Saying our grace is only in our heels,
==35== And that we are most lofty runaways.

**FR. KING.**
==36== Where is Montjoy the herald? Speed him hence,
==37== Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.
==38== Up, princes, and, with spirit of honor edged
==39== More sharper than your swords, hie to the field!
==40== Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,
==41== You Dukes of Orléans, Bourbon, and of Berri,
==42== Alanson, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy,
==43== Jacques Chatillion, Rambures, Vaudemont,
==44== Beaumont, Grandpré, Roussi, and Faulconbridge,
==45== Foix, Lestrake, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;
==46== High dukes, great princes, barons, lords, and knights,
==47== For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
==48== Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
==49== With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.
==50== Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
==51== Upon the valleys whose low vassal seat
==52== The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon.
==53== Go down upon him, you have power enough,
==54== And in a captive chariot into Roan
==55== Bring him our prisoner.

**CON.**
==55==               This becomes the great.
==56== Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
==57== His soldiers sick and famish’d in their march;
==58== For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
==59== He’ll drop his heart into the sink of fear,
==60== And for achievement offer us his ransom.

**FR. KING.**
==61== Therefore, Lord Constable, haste on Montjoy,
==62== And let him say to England that we send
==63== To know what willing ransom he will give.
==64== Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Roan.

**DAU.**
==65== Not so, I do beseech your Majesty.

**FR. KING.**
==66== Be patient, for you shall remain with us.
==67== Now forth, Lord Constable and princes all,
==68== And quickly bring us word of England’s fall.

*Exeunt.*
