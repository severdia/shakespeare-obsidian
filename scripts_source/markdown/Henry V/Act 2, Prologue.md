## Act 2, Prologue
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]


*Flourish. Enter Chorus.*

**CHORUS.**
==1==Now all the youth of England are on fire,
==2==And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies;
==3==Now thrive the armorers, and honor’s thought
==4==Reigns solely in the breast of every man.
==5==They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
==6==Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
==7==With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
==8==For now sits Expectation in the air,
==9==And hides a sword, from hilts unto the point,
==10==With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,
==11==Promis’d to Harry and his followers.
==12==The French, advis’d by good intelligence
==13==Of this most dreadful preparation,
==14==Shake in their fear, and with pale policy
==15==Seek to divert the English purposes.
==16==O England! Model to thy inward greatness,
==17==Like little body with a mighty heart,
==18==What mightst thou do, that honor would thee do,
==19==Were all thy children kind and natural!
==20==But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out,
==21==A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
==22==With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
==23==One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
==24==Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
==25==Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
==26==Have for the gilt of France (O guilt indeed!) 
==27==Confirm’d conspiracy with fearful France,
==28==And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
==29==If hell and treason hold their promises,
==30==Ere he take ship for France; and in Southampton.
==31==Linger your patience on, and we’ll digest
==32==Th’ abuse of distance; force a play:
==33==The sum is paid, the traitors are agreed,
==34==The King is set from London, and the scene
==35==Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
==36==There is the playhouse now, there must you sit,
==37==And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
==38==And bring you back, charming the Narrow Seas
==39==To give you gentle pass; for if we may,
==40==We’ll not offend one stomach with our play.
==41==But till the King come forth, and not till then,
==42==Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.


*Exit.*
