## Act 1, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Prologue|← Act 1, Prologue]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*London. Antechamber in the King’s Palace.*

*Enter the two Bishops, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.*

**CANT.**
==1== My lord, I’ll tell you, that self bill is urg’d
==2== Which in th’ eleventh year of the last king’s reign
==3== Was like, and had indeed against us pass’d,
==4== But that the scambling and unquiet time
==5== Did push it out of farther question.

**ELY.**
==6== But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?

**CANT.**
==7== It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
==8== We lose the better half of our possession;
==9== For all the temporal lands, which men devout
==10== By testament have given to the Church,
==11== Would they strip from us; being valu’d thus:
==12== As much as would maintain, to the King’s honor,
==13== Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
==14== Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
==15== And to relief of lazars, and weak age
==16== Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,
==17== A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
==18== And to the coffers of the King beside,
==19== A thousand pounds by th’ year. Thus runs the bill.

**ELY.**
==20== This would drink deep.

**CANT.**
==20==            ’Twould drink the cup and all.

**ELY.**
==21== But what prevention?

**CANT.**
==22== The King is full of grace and fair regard.

**ELY.**
==23== And a true lover of the holy Church.

**CANT.**
==24== The courses of his youth promis’d it not.
==25== The breath no sooner left his father’s body,
==26== But that his wildness, mortified in him,
==27== Seem’d to die too; yea, at that very moment,
==28== Consideration like an angel came
==29== And whipt th’ offending Adam out of him,
==30== Leaving his body as a paradise
==31== T’ envelop and contain celestial spirits.
==32== Never was such a sudden scholar made;
==33== Never came reformation in a flood
==34== With such a heady currance, scouring faults;
==35== Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness
==36== So soon did lose his seat (and all at once) 
==37== As in this king.

**ELY.**
==37==         We are blessed in the change.

**CANT.**
==38== Hear him but reason in divinity,
==39== And all-admiring, with an inward wish
==40== You would desire the King were made a prelate;
==41== Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
==42== You would say it hath been all in all his study;
==43== List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
==44== A fearful battle rend’red you in music;
==45== Turn him to any cause of policy,
==46== The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
==47== Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,
==48== The air, a charter’d libertine, is still,
==49== And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears
==50== To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;
==51== So that the art and practic part of life
==52== Must be the mistress to this theoric;
==53== Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,
==54== Since his addiction was to courses vain,
==55== His companies unletter’d, rude, and shallow,
==56== His hours fill’d up with riots, banquets, sports;
==57== And never noted in him any study,
==58== Any retirement, any sequestration
==59== From open haunts and popularity.

**ELY.**
==60== The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,
==61== And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
==62== Neighbor’d by fruit of baser quality;
==63== And so the Prince obscur’d his contemplation
==64== Under the veil of wildness, which (no doubt) 
==65== Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
==66== Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.

**CANT.**
==67== It must be so; for miracles are ceas’d;
==68== And therefore we must needs admit the means
==69== How things are perfected.

**ELY.**
==69==               But, my good lord,
==70== How now for mitigation of this bill
==71== Urg’d by the commons? Doth his Majesty
==72== Incline to it, or no?

**CANT.**
==72==            He seems indifferent;
==73== Or rather swaying more upon our part
==74== Than cherishing th’ exhibitors against us;
==75== For I have made an offer to his Majesty,
==76== Upon our spiritual convocation
==77== And in regard of causes now in hand,
==78== Which I have open’d to his Grace at large,
==79== As touching France, to give a greater sum
==80== Than ever at one time the clergy yet
==81== Did to his predecessors part withal.

**ELY.**
==82== How did this offer seem receiv’d, my lord?

**CANT.**
==83== With good acceptance of his Majesty;
==84== Save that there was not time enough to hear,
==85== As I perceiv’d his Grace would fain have done,
==86== The severals and unhidden passages
==87== Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,
==88== And generally to the crown and seat of France,
==89== Deriv’d from Edward, his great-grandfather.

**ELY.**
==90== What was th’ impediment that broke this off?

**CANT.**
==91== The French ambassador upon that instant
==92== Crav’d audience; and the hour, I think, is come
==93== To give him hearing. Is it four a’ clock?

**ELY.**
==94== It is.

**CANT.**
==95== Then go we in, to know his embassy;
==96== Which I could with a ready guess declare,
==97== Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.

**ELY.**
==98== I’ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

*Exeunt.*
