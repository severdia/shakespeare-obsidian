## Act 3, Prologue
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]


*Flourish. Enter Chorus.*

**CHORUS.**
==1==Thus with imagin’d wing our swift scene flies
==2==In motion of no less celerity
==3==Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
==4==The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
==5==Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
==6==With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning.
==7==Play with your fancies: and in them behold
==8==Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
==9==Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
==10==To sounds confus’d; behold the threaden sails,
==11==Borne with th’ invisible and creeping wind,
==12==Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,
==13==Breasting the lofty surge. O, do but think
==14==You stand upon the rivage and behold
==15==A city on th’ inconstant billows dancing;
==16==For so appears this fleet majestical,
==17==Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!
==18==Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
==19==And leave your England as dead midnight, still,
==20==Guarded with grandsires, babies, and old women,
==21==Either past or not arriv’d to pith and puissance;
==22==For who is he, whose chin is but enrich’d
==23==With one appearing hair, that will not follow
==24==These cull’d and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
==25==Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
==26==Behold the ordinance on their carriages,
==27==With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
==28==Suppose th’ ambassador from the French comes back,
==29==Tells Harry that the King doth offer him
==30==Katherine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,
==31==Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
==32==The offer likes not; and the nimble gunner
==33==With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
*(Alarum, and chambers go off.)*
==34==And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
==35==And eche out our performance with your mind.


*Exit.*
