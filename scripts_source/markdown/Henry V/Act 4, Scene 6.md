## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 7|Act 4, Scene 7 →]]

*Another part of the battlefield.*

*Alarum. Enter the King and his Train with prisoners; Exeter and others.*

**K. HEN.**
==1==Well have we done, thrice-valiant countrymen,
==2==But all’s not done—yet keep the French the field.

**EXE.**
==3==The Duke of York commends him to your Majesty.

**K. HEN.**
==4==Lives he, good uncle? Thrice within this hour
==5==I saw him down; thrice up again, and fighting;
==6==From helmet to the spur all blood he was.

**EXE.**
==7==In which array (brave soldier!) doth he lie,
==8==Larding the plain; and by his bloody side
==9==(Yoke-fellow to his honor-owing wounds) 
==10==The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
==11==Suffolk first died, and York, all haggled over,
==12==Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped,
==13==And takes him by the beard, kisses the gashes
==14==That bloodily did yawn upon his face.
==15==He cries aloud, “Tarry, my cousin Suffolk!
==16==My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
==17==Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
==18==As in this glorious and well-foughten field
==19==We kept together in our chivalry!”
==20==Upon these words I came and cheer’d him up.
==21==He smil’d me in the face, raught me his hand,
==22==And with a feeble gripe, says, “Dear my lord,
==23==Commend my service to my sovereign.”
==24==So did he turn and over Suffolk’s neck
==25==He threw his wounded arm, and kiss’d his lips,
==26==And so espous’d to death, with blood he seal’d
==27==A testament of noble-ending love.
==28==The pretty and sweet manner of it forc’d
==29==Those waters from me which I would have stopp’d,
==30==But I had not so much of man in me,
==31==And all my mother came into mine eyes
==32==And gave me up to tears.

**K. HEN.**
==32==              I blame you not,
==33==For hearing this, I must perforce compound
==34==With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.
*(Alarum.)*
==35==But hark, what new alarum is this same?
==36==The French have reinforc’d their scatter’d men.
==37==Then every soldier kill his prisoners,
==38==Give the word through.

*Exeunt.*
