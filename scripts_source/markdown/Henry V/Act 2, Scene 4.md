## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Prologue|Act 3, Prologue →]]

*France. An apartment in the King’s palace.*

*Flourish. Enter the French King, the Dauphin, the Dukes of Berri and Britain, the Constable, and others.*

**FR. KING.**
==1==Thus comes the English with full power upon us,
==2==And more than carefully it us concerns
==3==To answer royally in our defenses.
==4==Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britain,
==5==Of Brabant and of Orléans, shall make forth,
==6==And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
==7==To line and new repair our towns of war
==8==With men of courage and with means defendant;
==9==For England his approaches makes as fierce
==10==As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
==11==It fits us then to be as provident
==12==As fear may teach us out of late examples
==13==Left by the fatal and neglected English
==14==Upon our fields.

**DAU.**
==14==        My most redoubted father,
==15==It is most meet we arm us ’gainst the foe;
==16==For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom
==17==(Though war nor no known quarrel were in question) 
==18==But that defenses, musters, preparations,
==19==Should be maintain’d, assembled, and collected,
==20==As were a war in expectation.
==21==Therefore, I say, ’tis meet we all go forth
==22==To view the sick and feeble parts of France;
==23==And let us do it with no show of fear,
==24==No, with no more than if we heard that England
==25==Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance;
==26==For, my good liege, she is so idly king’d,
==27==Her scepter so fantastically borne,
==28==By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
==29==That fear attends her not.

**CON.**
==29==              O, peace, Prince Dauphin,
==30==You are too much mistaken in this king.
==31==Question your Grace the late ambassadors,
==32==With what great state he heard their embassy,
==33==How well supplied with noble counselors,
==34==How modest in exception, and withal
==35==How terrible in constant resolution,
==36==And you shall find his vanities forespent
==37==Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
==38==Covering discretion with a coat of folly,
==39==As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
==40==That shall first spring and be most delicate.

**DAU.**
==41==Well, ’tis not so, my Lord High Constable;
==42==But though we think it so, it is no matter.
==43==In cases of defense ’tis best to weigh
==44==The enemy more mighty than he seems,
==45==So the proportions of defense are fill’d;
==46==Which, of a weak and niggardly projection,
==47==Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting
==48==A little cloth.

**FR. KING.**
==48==        Think we King Harry strong;
==49==And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
==50==The kindred of him hath been flesh’d upon us;
==51==And he is bred out of that bloody strain
==52==That haunted us in our familiar paths.
==53==Witness our too much memorable shame
==54==When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
==55==And all our princes captiv’d by the hand
==56==Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
==57==Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,
==58==Up in the air, crown’d with the golden sun,
==59==Saw his heroical seed, and smil’d to see him,
==60==Mangle the work of nature, and deface
==61==The patterns that by God and by French fathers
==62==Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
==63==Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
==64==The native mightiness and fate of him.

*Enter a French Court Attendant.*

**FR. ATT.**
==65==Ambassadors from Harry King of England
==66==Do crave admittance to your Majesty.

**FR. KING.**
==67==We’ll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.
*(Exeunt French Court Attendant and certain Lords.)*
==68==You see this chase is hotly followed, friends.

**DAU.**
==69==Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
==70==Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
==71==Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
==72==Take up the English short, and let them know
==73==Of what a monarchy you are the head.
==74==Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
==75==As self-neglecting.

*Enter Lords with Exeter and Train.*

**FR. KING.**
==76==From our brother of England?

**EXE.**
==77==From him, and thus he greets your Majesty:
==78==He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
==79==That you divest yourself, and lay apart
==80==The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven,
==81==By law of nature and of nations, ’longs
==82==To him and to his heirs, namely, the crown,
==83==And all wide-stretched honors that pertain
==84==By custom, and the ordinance of times,
==85==Unto the crown of France. That you may know
==86==’Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
==87==Pick’d from the worm-holes of long-vanish’d days,
==88==Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak’d,
==89==He sends you this most memorable line,
==90==In every branch truly demonstrative;
*(Giving a paper.)*
==91==Willing you overlook this pedigree;
==92==And when you find him evenly deriv’d
==93==From his most fam’d of famous ancestors,
==94==Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
==95==Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
==96==From him, the native and true challenger.

**FR. KING.**
==97==Or else what follows?

**EXE.**
==98==Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
==99==Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
==100==Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
==101==In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
==102==That if requiring fail he will compel;
==103==And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
==104==Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
==105==On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
==106==Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
==107==Turning the widows’ tears, the orphans’ cries,
==108==The dead men’s blood, the privy maidens’ groans,
==109==For husbands, fathers, and betrothed lovers,
==110==That shall be swallowed in this controversy.
==111==This is his claim, his threat’ning, and my message;
==112==Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
==113==To whom expressly I bring greeting too.

**FR. KING.**
==114==For us, we will consider of this further.
==115==Tomorrow shall you bear our full intent
==116==Back to our brother of England.

**DAU.**
==116==                  For the Dauphin,
==117==I stand here for him. What to him from England?

**EXE.**
==118==Scorn and defiance, slight regard, contempt,
==119==And any thing that may not misbecome
==120==The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
==121==Thus says my King: and if your father’s Highness
==122==Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
==123==Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty,
==124==He’ll call you to so hot an answer of it
==125==That caves and womby vaultages of France
==126==Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
==127==In second accent of his ordinance.

**DAU.**
==128==Say: if my father render fair return,
==129==It is against my will; for I desire
==130==Nothing but odds with England. To that end,
==131==As matching to his youth and vanity,
==132==I did present him with the Paris balls.

**EXE.**
==133==He’ll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
==134==Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe;
==135==And, be assur’d, you’ll find a difference,
==136==As we his subjects have in wonder found,
==137==Between the promise of his greener days
==138==And these he masters now. Now he weighs time
==139==Even to the utmost grain; that you shall read
==140==In your own losses, if he stay in France.

**FR. KING.**
==141==Tomorrow shall you know our mind at full.

*Flourish.*

**EXE.**
==142==Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our King
==143==Come here himself to question our delay;
==144==For he is footed in this land already.

**FR. KING.**
==145==You shall be soon dispatch’d, with fair conditions.
==146==A night is but small breath, and little pause,
==147==To answer matters of this consequence.

*Exeunt.*
