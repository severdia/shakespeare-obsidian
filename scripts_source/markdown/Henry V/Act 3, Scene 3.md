## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*France. Before the Harfleur Gates.*

*Enter some Citizens on the walls. Enter the King and all his Train before the gates.*

**K. HEN.**
==1==How yet resolves the governor of the town?
==2==This is the latest parle we will admit;
==3==Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves,
==4==Or like to men proud of destruction,
==5==Defy us to our worst; for as I am a soldier,
==6==A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
==7==If I begin the batt’ry once again,
==8==I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
==9==Till in her ashes she lies buried.
==10==The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
==11==And the flesh’d soldier, rough and hard of heart,
==12==In liberty of bloody hand, shall range,
==13==With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
==14==Your fresh fair virgins and your flow’ring infants.
==15==What is it then to me, if impious War,
==16==Arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends,
==17==Do with his smirch’d complexion all fell feats
==18==Enlink’d to waste and desolation?
==19==What is’t to me, when you yourselves are cause,
==20==If your pure maidens fall into the hand
==21==Of hot and forcing violation?
==22==What rein can hold licentious wickedness
==23==When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
==24==We may as bootless spend our vain command
==25==Upon th’ enraged soldiers in their spoil,
==26==As send precepts to the leviathan
==27==To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
==28==Take pity of your town and of your people,
==29==Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command,
==30==Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
==31==O’erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
==32==Of headly murder, spoil, and villainy.
==33==If not—why, in a moment look to see
==34==The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
==35==Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
==36==Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
==37==And their most reverend heads dash’d to the walls;
==38==Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
==39==Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus’d
==40==Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
==41==At Herod’s bloody-hunting slaughter-men.
==42==What say you? Will you yield, and this avoid?
==43==Or guilty in defense, be thus destroy’d?

*Enter Governor to the Citizens.*

**GOV.**
==44==Our expectation hath this day an end.
==45==The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,
==46==Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
==47==To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great King,
==48==We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
==49==Enter our gates, dispose of us and ours,
==50==For we no longer are defensible.

**K. HEN.**
==51==Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,
==52==Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,
==53==And fortify it strongly ’gainst the French.
==54==Use mercy to them all for us, dear uncle.
==55==The winter coming on, and sickness growing
==56==Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Callice.
==57==Tonight in Harfleur will we be your guest;
==58==Tomorrow for the march are we address’d.

*Flourish, and enter the town.*
