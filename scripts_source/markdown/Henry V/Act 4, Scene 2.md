## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*The French camp.*

*Enter the Dauphin, Orléans, and Rambures.*

**ORL.**
==1== The sun doth gild our armor, up, my lords!

**DAU.**
==2== *Montez à cheval!* My horse, varlot lackey! Ha!

**ORL.**
==3== O brave spirit!

**DAU.**
==4== *Via! Les eaux et terre.*

**ORL.**
==5== *Rien puis? L’air et feu?*

**DAU.**
==6== *Cieux!* Cousin Orléans.
*(Enter Constable.)*
==7== Now, my Lord Constable?

**CON.**
==8== Hark how our steeds for present service neigh!

**DAU.**
==9== Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
==10== That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
==11== And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!

**RAM.**
==12== What, will you have them weep our horses’ blood?
==13== How shall we then behold their natural tears?

*Enter French Messenger.*

**FR. MESS.**
==14== The English are embattled, you French peers.

**CON.**
==15== To horse, you gallant princes! Straight to horse!
==16== Do but behold yond poor and starved band,
==17== And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
==18== Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
==19== There is not work enough for all our hands,
==20== Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
==21== To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,
==22== That our French gallants shall today draw out,
==23== And sheathe for lack of sport. Let us but blow on them,
==24== The vapor of our valor will o’erturn them.
==25== ’Tis positive against all exceptions, lords,
==26== That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
==27== Who in unnecessary action swarm
==28== About our squares of battle, were enow
==29== To purge this field of such a hilding foe;
==30== Though we upon this mountain’s basis by
==31== Took stand for idle speculation⁠—
==32== But that our honors must not. What’s to say?
==33== A very little little let us do,
==34== And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
==35== The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
==36== For our approach shall so much dare the field,
==37== That England shall crouch down in fear, and yield.

*Enter Grandpré.*

**GRAND.**
==38== Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?
==39== Yond island carrions, desperate of their bones,
==40== Ill-favoredly become the morning field.
==41== Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
==42== And our air shakes them passing scornfully.
==43== Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar’d host,
==44== And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps.
==45== The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,
==46== With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades
==47== Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
==48== The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes,
==49== And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal’d bit
==50== Lies foul with chaw’d-grass, still and motionless;
==51== And their executors, the knavish crows,
==52== Fly o’er them all, impatient for their hour.
==53== Description cannot suit itself in words
==54== To demonstrate the life of such a battle,
==55== In life so lifeless as it shows itself.

**CON.**
==56== They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.

**DAU.**
==57== Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits,
==58== And give their fasting horses provender,
==59== And after fight with them?

**CON.**
==60== I stay but for my guidon; to the field!
==61== I will the banner from a trumpet take,
==62== And use it for my haste. Come, come away!
==63== The sun is high, and we outwear the day.

*Exeunt.*
