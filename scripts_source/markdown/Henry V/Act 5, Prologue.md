## Act 5, Prologue
[[Act 4, Scene 8|← Act 4, Scene 8]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Chorus.*

**CHORUS.**
==1==Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,
==2==That I may prompt them; and of such as have,
==3==I humbly pray them to admit th’ excuse
==4==Of time, of numbers, and due course of things,
==5==Which cannot in their huge and proper life
==6==Be here presented. Now we bear the King
==7==Toward Callice; grant him there; there seen,
==8==Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
==9==Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
==10==Pales in the flood with men, wives, and boys,
==11==Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep-mouth’d sea,
==12==Which like a mighty whiffler ’fore the King
==13==Seems to prepare his way. So let him land,
==14==And solemnly see him set on to London.
==15==So swift a pace hath thought that even now
==16==You may imagine him upon Blackheath;
==17==Where that his lords desire him to have borne
==18==His bruised helmet and his bended sword
==19==Before him through the city. He forbids it,
==20==Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;
==21==Giving full trophy, signal, and ostent
==22==Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
==23==In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
==24==How London doth pour out her citizens!
==25==The Mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
==26==Like to the senators of th’ antique Rome,
==27==With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
==28==Go forth and fetch their conqu’ring Caesar in;
==29==As by a lower but by loving likelihood,
==30==Were now the general of our gracious Empress,
==31==As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,
==32==Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
==33==How many would the peaceful city quit,
==34==To welcome him! Much more, and much more cause,
==35==Did they this Harry. Now in London place him⁠—
==36==As yet the lamentation of the French
==37==Invites the King of England’s stay at home;
==38==The Emperor’s coming in behalf of France,
==39==To order peace between them—and omit
==40==All the occurrences, what ever chanc’d,
==41==Till Harry’s back-return again to France.
==42==There must we bring him; and myself have play’d
==43==The interim, by rememb’ring you ’tis past.
==44==Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,
==45==After your thoughts, straight back again to France.


*Exit.*
