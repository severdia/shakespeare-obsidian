## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Another part of the battlefield.*

*Enter Constable, Orléans, Bourbon, Dauphin, and Rambures.*

**CON.**
==1== *O diable!*

**ORL.**
==2== *O Seigneur! Le jour est perdu, tout est perdu!*

**DAU.**
==3== *Mort Dieu, ma vie!* All is confounded, all!
==4== Reproach and everlasting shame
==5== Sits mocking in our plumes.
*(A short alarum.)*
==5==                 *O méchante fortune!*
==6== Do not run away.

**CON.**
==6==            Why, all our ranks are broke.

**DAU.**
==7== O perdurable shame! Let’s stab ourselves.
==8== Be these the wretches that we play’d at dice for?

**ORL.**
==9== Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?

**BOUR.**
==10== Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
==11== Let us die! In once more! Back again!
==12== And he that will not follow Bourbon now,
==13== Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand
==14== Like a base pander hold the chamber-door
==15== Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,
==16== His fairest daughter is contaminated.

**CON.**
==17== Disorder, that hath spoil’d us, friend us now!
==18== Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.

**ORL.**
==19== We are enow yet living in the field
==20== To smother up the English in our throngs,
==21== If any order might be thought upon.

**BOUR.**
==22== The devil take order now! I’ll to the throng:
==23== Let life be short, else shame will be too long.

*Exeunt.*
