## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Prologue|Act 2, Prologue →]]

*London. Presence Chamber in the King’s Palace.*

*Enter the King, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, Bedford, Clarence, Warwick, Westmorland, and Exeter, and other Attendants.*

**K. HEN.**
==1==Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?

**EXE.**
==2==Not here in presence.

**K. HEN.**
==2==           Send for him, good uncle.

**WEST.**
==3==Shall we call in th’ ambassador, my liege?

**K. HEN.**
==4==Not yet, my cousin. We would be resolv’d,
==5==Before we hear him, of some things of weight
==6==That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.

*Enter two Bishops, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely.*

**CANT.**
==7==God and his angels guard your sacred throne,
==8==And make you long become it!

**K. HEN.**
==8==                Sure we thank you.
==9==My learned lord, we pray you to proceed,
==10==And justly and religiously unfold
==11==Why the law Salique, that they have in France,
==12==Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim;
==13==And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
==14==That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
==15==Or nicely charge your understanding soul
==16==With opening titles miscreate, whose right
==17==Suits not in native colors with the truth;
==18==For God doth know how many now in health
==19==Shall drop their blood in approbation
==20==Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
==21==Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
==22==How you awake our sleeping sword of war⁠—
==23==We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
==24==For never two such kingdoms did contend
==25==Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops
==26==Are every one a woe, a sore complaint,
==27==’Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords
==28==That makes such waste in brief mortality.
==29==Under this conjuration speak, my lord;
==30==For we will hear, note, and believe in heart,
==31==That what you speak is in your conscience wash’d
==32==As pure as sin with baptism.

**CANT.**
==33==Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
==34==That owe yourselves, your lives, and services
==35==To this imperial throne. There is no bar
==36==To make against your Highness’ claim to France
==37==But this, which they produce from Pharamond:
==38==“*In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant,*”
==39==“No woman shall succeed in Salique land”;
==40==Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
==41==To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
==42==The founder of this law and female bar.
==43==Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
==44==That the land Salique is in Germany,
==45==Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
==46==Where Charles the Great, having subdu’d the Saxons,
==47==There left behind and settled certain French;
==48==Who holding in disdain the German women
==49==For some dishonest manners of their life,
==50==Establish’d then this law: to wit, no female
==51==Should be inheritrix in Salique land;
==52==Which Salique, as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala,
==53==Is at this day in Germany call’d Meisen.
==54==Then doth it well appear the Salique law
==55==Was not devised for the realm of France;
==56==Nor did the French possess the Salique land
==57==Until four hundred one and twenty years
==58==After defunction of King Pharamond,
==59==Idly suppos’d the founder of this law,
==60==Who died within the year of our redemption
==61==Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
==62==Subdu’d the Saxons, and did seat the French
==63==Beyond the river Sala, in the year
==64==Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
==65==King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
==66==Did, as heir general, being descended
==67==Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
==68==Make claim and title to the crown of France.
==69==Hugh Capet also, who usurp’d the crown
==70==Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
==71==Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
==72==To fine his title with some shows of truth,
==73==Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,
==74==Convey’d himself as th’ heir to th’ Lady Lingare,
==75==Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
==76==To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son
==77==Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
==78==Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
==79==Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
==80==Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
==81==That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
==82==Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
==83==Daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;
==84==By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
==85==Was re-united to the crown of France.
==86==So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,
==87==King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,
==88==King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
==89==To hold in right and title of the female;
==90==So do the kings of France unto this day.
==91==Howbeit, they would hold up this Salique law
==92==To bar your Highness claiming from the female,
==93==And rather choose to hide them in a net
==94==Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
==95==Usurp’d from you and your progenitors.

**K. HEN.**
==96==May I with right and conscience make this claim?

**CANT.**
==97==The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
==98==For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
==99==When the man dies, let the inheritance
==100==Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
==101==Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,
==102==Look back into your mighty ancestors;
==103==Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire’s tomb,
==104==From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
==105==And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince,
==106==Who on the French ground play’d a tragedy,
==107==Making defeat on the full power of France,
==108==Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
==109==Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp
==110==Forage in blood of French nobility.
==111==O noble English, that could entertain
==112==With half their forces the full pride of France,
==113==And let another half stand laughing by,
==114==All out of work and cold for action!

**ELY.**
==115==Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,
==116==And with your puissant arm renew their feats.
==117==You are their heir, you sit upon their throne;
==118==The blood and courage that renowned them
==119==Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
==120==Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
==121==Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.

**EXE.**
==122==Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
==123==Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
==124==As did the former lions of your blood.

**WEST.**
==125==They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;
==126==So hath your Highness. Never King of England
==127==Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
==128==Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England,
==129==And lie pavilion’d in the fields of France.

**CANT.**
==130==O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
==131==With blood and sword and fire, to win your right;
==132==In aid whereof we of the spiritually
==133==Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum
==134==As never did the clergy at one time
==135==Bring in to any of your ancestors.

**K. HEN.**
==136==We must not only arm t’ invade the French,
==137==But lay down our proportions to defend
==138==Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
==139==With all advantages.

**CANT.**
==140==They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
==141==Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
==142==Our inland from the pilfering borderers.

**K. HEN.**
==143==We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
==144==But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
==145==Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us;
==146==For you shall read that my great-grandfather
==147==Never went with his forces into France
==148==But that the Scot on his unfurnish’d kingdom
==149==Came pouring like the tide into a breach,
==150==With ample and brim fullness of his force,
==151==Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
==152==Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
==153==That England being empty of defense,
==154==Hath shook and trembled at th’ ill neighborhood.

**CANT.**
==155==She hath been then more fear’d than harm’d, my liege;
==156==For hear her but exampled by herself:
==157==When all her chevalry hath been in France,
==158==And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
==159==She hath herself not only well defended
==160==But taken and impounded as a stray
==161==The King of Scots; whom she did send to France
==162==To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings,
==163==And make her chronicle as rich with praise
==164==As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
==165==With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.

**ELY.**
==166==But there’s a saying very old and true,
==167==*“If that you will France win,*
==168==*Then with Scotland first begin.”*
==169==For once the eagle (England) being in prey,
==170==To her unguarded nest the weasel (Scot) 
==171==Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs,
==172==Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
==173==To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat.

**EXE.**
==174==It follows then the cat must stay at home,
==175==Yet that is but a crush’d necessity,
==176==Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
==177==And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
==178==While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
==179==Th’ advised head defends itself at home;
==180==For government, though high, and low, and lower,
==181==Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
==182==Congreeing in a full and natural close,
==183==Like music.

**CANT.**
==184==Therefore doth heaven divide
==185==The state of man in diverse functions,
==186==Setting endeavor in continual motion;
==187==To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
==188==Obedience; for so work the honey-bees,
==189==Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
==190==The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
==191==They have a king, and officers of sorts,
==192==Where some, like magistrates, correct at home;
==193==Others, like merchants, venter trade abroad;
==194==Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
==195==Make boot upon the summer’s velvet buds,
==196==Which pillage they with merry march bring home
==197==To the tent-royal of their emperor;
==198==Who busied in his majesty surveys
==199==The singing masons building roofs of gold,
==200==The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
==201==The poor mechanic porters crowding in
==202==Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
==203==The sad-ey’d justice, with his surly hum,
==204==Delivering o’er to executors pale
==205==The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
==206==That many things, having full reference
==207==To one consent, may work contrariously,
==208==As many arrows loosed several ways
==209==Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
==210==As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
==211==As many lines close in the dial’s center;
==212==So may a thousand actions, once afoot,
==213==End in one purpose, and be all well borne
==214==Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege!
==215==Divide your happy England into four,
==216==Whereof take you one quarter into France,
==217==And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
==218==If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
==219==Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
==220==Let us be worried, and our nation lose
==221==The name of hardiness and policy.

**K. HEN.**
==222==Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
*(Exeunt some Attendants.)*
==223==Now are we well resolv’d, and by God’s help
==224==And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
==225==France being ours, we’ll bend it to our awe,
==226==Or break it all to pieces. Or there we’ll sit,
==227==Ruling in large and ample empery
==228==O’er France and all her (almost) kingly dukedoms,
==229==Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
==230==Tombless, with no remembrance over them.
==231==Either our history shall with full mouth
==232==Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
==233==Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
==234==Not worshipp’d with a waxen epitaph.
*(Enter Ambassadors of France attended.)*
==235==Now are we well prepar’d to know the pleasure
==236==Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
==237==Your greeting is from him, not from the King.

**1. AMB.**
==238==May’t please your Majesty to give us leave
==239==Freely to render what we have in charge?
==240==Or shall we sparingly show you far off
==241==The Dauphin’s meaning and our embassy?

**K. HEN.**
==242==We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,
==243==Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
==244==As is our wretches fett’red in our prisons;
==245==Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
==246==Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.

**1. AMB.**
==246==              Thus then in few:
==247==Your Highness, lately sending into France,
==248==Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
==249==Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
==250==In answer of which claim, the prince our master
==251==Says that you savor too much of your youth,
==252==And bids you be advis’d: there’s nought in France
==253==That can be with a nimble galliard won;
==254==You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
==255==He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
==256==This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
==257==Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
==258==Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.

**K. HEN.**
==259==What treasure, uncle?

**EXE.**
==259==           Tennis-balls, my liege.

**K. HEN.**
==260==We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us,
==261==His present and your pains we thank you for.
==262==When we have match’d our rackets to these balls,
==263==We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set
==264==Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.
==265==Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
==266==That all the courts of France will be disturb’d
==267==With chaces. And we understand him well,
==268==How he comes o’er us with our wilder days,
==269==Not measuring what use we made of them.
==270==We never valu’d this poor seat of England,
==271==And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
==272==To barbarous license; as ’tis ever common
==273==That men are merriest when they are from home.
==274==But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
==275==Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness
==276==When I do rouse me in my throne of France.
==277==For that I have laid by my majesty,
==278==And plodded like a man for working-days;
==279==But I will rise there with so full a glory
==280==That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
==281==Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
==282==And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
==283==Hath turn’d his balls to gun-stones, and his soul
==284==Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
==285==That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows
==286==Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
==287==Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
==288==And some are yet ungotten and unborn
==289==That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn.
==290==But this lies all within the will of God,
==291==To whom I do appeal, and in whose name
==292==Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on
==293==To venge me as I may, and to put forth
==294==My rightful hand in a well-hallow’d cause.
==295==So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
==296==His jest will savor but of shallow wit,
==297==When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.⁠—
==298==Convey them with safe conduct.—Fare you well.

*Exeunt Ambassadors.*

**EXE.**
==299==This was a merry message.

**K. HEN.**
==300==We hope to make the sender blush at it.
==301==Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
==302==That may give furth’rance to our expedition;
==303==For we have now no thought in us but France,
==304==Save those to God, that run before our business.
==305==Therefore let our proportions for these wars
==306==Be soon collected, and all things thought upon
==307==That may with reasonable swiftness add
==308==More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
==309==We’ll chide this Dauphin at his father’s door.
==310==Therefore let every man now task his thought,
==311==That this fair action may on foot be brought.

*Exeunt.*
