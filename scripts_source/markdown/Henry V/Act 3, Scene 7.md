## Act 3, Scene 7
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Prologue|Act 4, Prologue →]]

*Agincourt. The French camp.*

*Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Rambures, Orléans, Dauphin, with others.*

**CON.**
Tut, I have the best armor of the world. Would it were day!

**ORL.**
You have an excellent armor; but let my horse have his due.

**CON.**
It is the best horse of Europe.

**ORL.**
Will it never be morning?

**DAU.**
My Lord of Orléans, and my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?

**ORL.**
You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.

**DAU.**
What a long night is this! I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns. *Ça, ha!* He bounds from the earth, as if his entrails were hairs; *le cheval volant, the Pegasus, chez les narines de feu!* When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk; he trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.

**ORL.**
He’s of the color of the nutmeg.

**DAU.**
And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus. He is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him. He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.

**CON.**
Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.

**DAU.**
It is the prince of palfreys: his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.

**ORL.**
No more, cousin.

**DAU.**
Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserv’d praise on my palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea; turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. ’Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on; and for the world, familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: “Wonder of nature”⁠—

**ORL.**
I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress.

**DAU.**
Then did they imitate that which I compos’d to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.

**ORL.**
Your mistress bears well.

**DAU.**
Me well, which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress.

**CON.**
Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back.

**DAU.**
So perhaps did yours.

**CON.**
Mine was not bridled.

**DAU.**
O then belike she was old and gentle, and you rode like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in your strait strossers.

**CON.**
You have good judgment in horsemanship.

**DAU.**
Be warn’d by me then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have my horse to my mistress.

**CON.**
I had as lief have my mistress a jade.

**DAU.**
I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears his own hair.

**CON.**
I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow to my mistress.

**DAU.**
*“Le chien est retourné à son propre vomissement, et la truie lavée au bourbier.”* Thou mak’st use of any thing.

**CON.**
Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose.

**RAM.**
My Lord Constable, the armor that I saw in your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?

**CON.**
Stars, my lord.

**DAU.**
Some of them will fall tomorrow, I hope.

**CON.**
And yet my sky shall not want.

**DAU.**
That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and ’twere more honor some were away.

**CON.**
Ev’n as your horse bears your praises, who would trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.

**DAU.**
Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will it never be day? I will trot tomorrow a mile, and my way shall be pav’d with English faces.

**CON.**
I will not say so, for fear I should be fac’d out of my way. But I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the ears of the English.

**RAM.**
Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?

**CON.**
You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.

**DAU.**
’Tis midnight, I’ll go arm myself.

*Exit.*

**ORL.**
The Dauphin longs for morning.

**RAM.**
He longs to eat the English.

**CON.**
I think he will eat all he kills.

**ORL.**
By the white hand of my lady, he’s a gallant prince.

**CON.**
Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.

**ORL.**
He is simply the most active gentleman of France.

**CON.**
Doing is activity, and he will still be doing.

**ORL.**
He never did harm, that I heard of.

**CON.**
Nor will do none tomorrow. He will keep that good name still.

**ORL.**
I know him to be valiant.

**CON.**
I was told that by one that knows him better than you.

**ORL.**
What’s he?

**CON.**
Marry, he told me so himself, and he said he car’d not who knew it.

**ORL.**
He needs not, it is no hidden virtue in him.

**CON.**
By my faith, sir, but it is; never anybody saw it but his lackey. ’Tis a hooded valor, and when it appears, it will bate.

**ORL.**
“Ill will never said well.”

**CON.**
I will cap that proverb with “There is flattery in friendship.”

**ORL.**
And I will take up that with “Give the devil his due.”

**CON.**
Well plac’d. There stands your friend for the devil; have at the very eye of that proverb with “A pox of the devil.”

**ORL.**
You are the better at proverbs, by how much “A fool’s bolt is soon shot.”

**CON.**
You have shot over.

**ORL.**
’Tis not the first time you were overshot.

*Enter French Court Attendant.*

**FR. ATT.**
My Lord High Constable, the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents.

**CON.**
Who hath measur’d the ground?

**FR. ATT.**
The Lord Grandpré.

**CON.**
A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were day! Alas, poor Harry of England! He longs not for the dawning as we do.

**ORL.**
What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England, to mope with his fat-brain’d followers so far out of his knowledge!

**CON.**
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.

**ORL.**
That they lack; for if their heads had any intellectual armor, they could never wear such heavy head-pieces.

**RAM.**
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.

**ORL.**
Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crush’d like rotten apples! You may as well say, that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.

**CON.**
Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving their wits with their wives; and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will eat like wolves and fight like devils.

**ORL.**
Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.

**CON.**
Then shall we find tomorrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm. Come, shall we about it?

**ORL.**
It is now two a’ clock; but let me see, by ten
We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.

*Exeunt.*
