## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Agincourt. The English camp.*

*Enter Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Erpingham with all his host; Salisbury and Westmorland.*

**GLOU.**
==1==Where is the King?

**BED.**
==2==The King himself is rode to view their battle.

**WEST.**
==3==Of fighting men they have full threescore thousand.

**EXE.**
==4==There’s five to one; besides, they all are fresh.

**SAL.**
==5==God’s arm strike with us! ’Tis a fearful odds.
==6==God buy you, princes all; I’ll to my charge.
==7==If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
==8==Then joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,
==9==My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
==10==And my kind kinsman, warriors all, *adieu*!

**BED.**
==11==Farewell, good Salisbury, and good luck go with thee!

**EXE.**
==12==Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly today!
==13==And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
==14==For thou art fram’d of the firm truth of valor.

*Exit Salisbury.*

**BED.**
==15==He is as full of valor as of kindness,
==16==Princely in both.

*Enter the King.*

**WEST.**
==16==           O that we now had here
==17==But one ten thousand of those men in England
==18==That do no work today!

**K. HEN.**
==18==              What’s he that wishes so?
==19==My cousin Westmorland? No, my fair cousin.
==20==If we are mark’d to die, we are enow
==21==To do our country loss; and if to live,
==22==The fewer men, the greater share of honor.
==23==God’s will, I pray thee wish not one man more.
==24==By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
==25==Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
==26==It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
==27==Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
==28==But if it be a sin to covet honor,
==29==I am the most offending soul alive.
==30==No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.
==31==God’s peace, I would not lose so great an honor
==32==As one man more methinks would share from me,
==33==For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
==34==Rather proclaim it, Westmorland, through my host,
==35==That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
==36==Let him depart, his passport shall be made,
==37==And crowns for convoy put into his purse.
==38==We would not die in that man’s company
==39==That fears his fellowship to die with us.
==40==This day is call’d the feast of Crispian:
==41==He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
==42==Will stand a’ tiptoe when this day is named,
==43==And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
==44==He that shall see this day, and live old age,
==45==Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors,
==46==And say, “Tomorrow is Saint Crispian.”
==47==Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
==48==And say, “These wounds I had on Crispin’s day.”
==49==Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
==50==But he’ll remember with advantages
==51==What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
==52==Familiar in his mouth as household words,
==53==Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
==54==Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
==55==Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb’red.
==56==This story shall the good man teach his son;
==57==And Crispin Crispian shall ne’er go by,
==58==From this day to the ending of the world,
==59==But we in it shall be remembered⁠—
==60==We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
==61==For he today that sheds his blood with me
==62==Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,
==63==This day shall gentle his condition;
==64==And gentlemen in England, now a-bed,
==65==Shall think themselves accurs’d they were not here;
==66==And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
==67==That fought with us upon Saint Crispin’s day.

*Enter Salisbury.*

**SAL.**
==68==My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed.
==69==The French are bravely in their battles set,
==70==And will with all expedience charge on us.

**K. HEN.**
==71==All things are ready, if our minds be so.

**WEST.**
==72==Perish the man whose mind is backward now!

**K. HEN.**
==73==Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?

**WEST.**
==74==God’s will, my liege, would you and I alone,
==75==Without more help, could fight this royal battle!

**K. HEN.**
==76==Why, now thou hast unwish’d five thousand men;
==77==Which likes me better than to wish us one.
==78==You know your places. God be with you all!

*Tucket. Enter Montjoy.*

**MONT.**
==79==Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,
==80==If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,
==81==Before thy most assured overthrow;
==82==For certainly thou art so near the gulf,
==83==Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,
==84==The Constable desires thee thou wilt mind
==85==Thy followers of repentance; that their souls
==86==May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
==87==From off these fields, where (wretches!) their poor bodies
==88==Must lie and fester.

**K. HEN.**
==88==           Who hath sent thee now?

**MONT.**
==89==The Constable of France.

**K. HEN.**
==90==I pray thee bear my former answer back:
==91==Bid them achieve me, and then sell my bones.
==92==Good God, why should they mock poor fellows thus?
==93==The man that once did sell the lion’s skin
==94==While the beast liv’d, was kill’d with hunting him.
==95==A many of our bodies shall no doubt
==96==Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
==97==Shall witness live in brass of this day’s work.
==98==And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
==99==Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
==100==They shall be fam’d; for there the sun shall greet them,
==101==And draw their honors reeking up to heaven,
==102==Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
==103==The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
==104==Mark then abounding valor in our English:
==105==That being dead, like to the bullet’s crasing,
==106==Break out into a second course of mischief,
==107==Killing in relapse of mortality.
==108==Let me speak proudly: tell the Constable
==109==We are but warriors for the working-day;
==110==Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch’d
==111==With rainy marching in the painful field;
==112==There’s not a piece of feather in our host⁠—
==113==Good argument (I hope) we will not fly⁠—
==114==And time hath worn us into slovenry.
==115==But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;
==116==And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night,
==117==They’ll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
==118==The gay new coats o’er the French soldiers’ heads
==119==And turn them out of service. If they do this⁠—
==120==As, if God please, they shall—my ransom then
==121==Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labor.
==122==Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald,
==123==They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
==124==Which if they have as I will leave ’um them,
==125==Shall yield them little, tell the Constable.

**MONT.**
==126==I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well;
==127==Thou never shalt hear herald any more.

*Exit.*

**K. HEN.**
==128==I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom.

*Enter York.*

**YORK.**
==129==My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
==130==The leading of the vaward.

**K. HEN.**
==131==Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away,
==132==And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!

*Exeunt.*
