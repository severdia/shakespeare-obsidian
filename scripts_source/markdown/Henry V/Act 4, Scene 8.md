## Act 4, Scene 8
[[Act 4, Scene 7|← Act 4, Scene 7]] | [[Act 5, Prologue|Act 5, Prologue →]]

*Before King Henry’s pavilion.*

*Enter Gower and Williams.*

**WILL.**
==1== I warrant it is to knight you, captain.

*Enter Fluellen.*

**FLU.**
==2== God’s will, and his pleasure, captain, I beseech you now, come apace to the King. There is more good toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of.

**WILL.**
==3== Sir, know you this glove?

**FLU.**
==4== Know the glove? I know the glove is a glove.

**WILL.**
==5== I know this, and thus I challenge it.

*Strikes him.*

**FLU.**
==6== ’Sblud, an arrant traitor as any’s in the universal world, or in France, or in England!

**GOW.**
==7== How now, sir? You villain!

**WILL.**
==8== Do you think I’ll be forsworn?

**FLU.**
==9== Stand away, Captain Gower, I will give treason his payment into *plows*, I warrant you.

**WILL.**
==10== I am no traitor.

**FLU.**
==11== That’s a lie in thy throat. I charge you in his Majesty’s name, apprehend him, he’s a friend of the Duke Alanson’s.

*Enter Warwick and Gloucester.*

**WAR.**
==12== How now, how now, what’s the matter?

**FLU.**
==13== My Lord of Warwick, here is—praised be God for it!—a most contagious treason come to light, look you, as you shall desire in a summer’s day. Here is his Majesty.

*Enter King and Exeter.*

**K. HEN.**
==14== How now, what’s the matter?

**FLU.**
==15== My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that, look your Grace, has struck the glove which your Majesty is take out of the helmet of Alanson.

**WILL.**
==16== My liege, this was my glove, here is the fellow of it; and he that I gave it to in change promis’d to wear it in his cap. I promis’d to strike him, if he did. I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I have been as good as my word.

**FLU.**
==17== Your Majesty hear now, saving your Majesty’s manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy knave it is. I hope your Majesty is *pear* me testimony and witness, and will avouchment, that this is the glove of Alanson that your Majesty is give me, in your conscience now.

**K. HEN.**
==18== Give me thy glove, soldier. Look, here is the fellow of it.
==19== ’Twas I indeed thou promisedst to strike,
==20== And thou hast given me most bitter terms.

**FLU.**
==21== And please your Majesty, let his neck answer for it, if there is any martial law in the world.

**K. HEN.**
==22== How canst thou make me satisfaction?

**WILL.**
==23== All offenses, my lord, come from the heart. Never came any from mine that might offend your Majesty.

**K. HEN.**
==24== It was ourself thou didst abuse.

**WILL.**
==25== Your Majesty came not like yourself. You appear’d to me but as a common man; witness the night, your garments, your lowliness; and what your Highness suffer’d under that shape, I beseech you take it for your own fault and not mine; for had you been as I took you for, I made no offense; therefore I beseech your Highness pardon me.

**K. HEN.**
==26== Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,
==27== And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow,
==28== And wear it for an honor in thy cap
==29== Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns;
==30== And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.

**FLU.**
==31== By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle enough in his belly. Hold, there is twelvepence for you, and I pray you to serve God, and keep you out of *prawls* and prabbles, and quarrels and dissensions, and I warrant you it is the better for you.

**WILL.**
==32== I will none of your money.

**FLU.**
==33== It is with a good will; I can tell you it will serve you to mend your shoes. Come, wherefore should you be so *pashful*? Your shoes is not so good. ’Tis a good *silling*, I warrant you, or I will change it.

*Enter an English Herald.*

**K. HEN.**
==34== Now, herald, are the dead numb’red?

**E. HER.**
==35== Here is the number of the slaught’red French.

*Gives a paper.*

**K. HEN.**
==36== What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?

**EXE.**
==37== Charles Duke of Orléans, nephew to the King,
==38== John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt:
==39== Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,
==40== Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.

**K. HEN.**
==41== This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
==42== That in the field lie slain; of princes, in this number,
==43== And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
==44== One hundred twenty-six; added to these,
==45== Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,
==46== Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
==47== Five hundred were but yesterday dubb’d knights.
==48== So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
==49== There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;
==50== The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,
==51== And gentlemen of blood and quality.
==52== The names of those their nobles that lie dead:
==53== Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France,
==54== Jacques of Chatillion, Admiral of France,
==55== The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures,
==56== Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dauphin,
==57== John Duke of Alanson, Anthony Duke of Brabant,
==58== The brother to the Duke of Burgundy,
==59== And Edward Duke of Bar; of lusty earls,
==60== Grandpré and Roussi, Faulconbridge and Foix,
==61== Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrake.
==62== Here was a royal fellowship of death!
==63== Where is the number of our English dead?
*(Herald shows him another paper.)*
==64== Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,
==65== Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire;
==66== None else of name; and of all other men
==67== But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;
==68== And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
==69== Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,
==70== But in plain shock and even play of battle,
==71== Was ever known so great and little loss,
==72== On one part and on th’ other? Take it, God,
==73== For it is none but thine!

**EXE.**
==73==               ’Tis wonderful!

**K. HEN.**
==74== Come, go we in procession to the village;
==75== And be it death proclaimed through our host
==76== To boast of this, or take that praise from God
==77== Which is his only.

**FLU.**
==78== Is it not lawful, and please your Majesty, to tell how many is kill’d?

**K. HEN.**
==79== Yes, captain; but with this acknowledgment,
==80== That God fought for us.

**FLU.**
==81== Yes, my conscience, he did us great good.

**K. HEN.**
==82== Do we all holy rites:
==83== Let there be sung *Non nobis* and *Te Deum*,
==84== The dead with charity enclos’d in clay;
==85== And then to Callice, and to England then,
==86== Where ne’er from France arriv’d more happy men.

*Exeunt.*
