## Epilogue
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]]


*Enter Chorus as Epilogue.*

**CHORUS.**
==1==Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,
==2==Our bending author hath pursu’d the story,
==3==In little room confining mighty men,
==4==Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
==5==Small time; but in that small most greatly lived
==6==This star of England. Fortune made his sword;
==7==By which the world’s best garden he achieved,
==8==And of it left his son imperial lord.
==9==Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown’d King
==10==Of France and England, did this king succeed;
==11==Whose state so many had the managing,
==12==That they lost France, and made his England bleed;
==13==Which oft our stage hath shown; and for their sake,
==14==In your fair minds let this acceptance take.


*Exit.*
