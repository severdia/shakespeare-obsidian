## Act 4, Prologue
[[Act 3, Scene 7|← Act 3, Scene 7]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Chorus.*

**CHORUS.**
==1==Now entertain conjecture of a time
==2==When creeping murmur and the poring dark
==3==Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
==4==From camp to camp, through the foul womb of night,
==5==The hum of either army stilly sounds,
==6==That the fix’d sentinels almost receive
==7==The secret whispers of each other’s watch.
==8==Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
==9==Each battle sees the other’s umber’d face.
==10==Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
==11==Piercing the night’s dull ear; and from the tents
==12==The armorers, accomplishing the knights,
==13==With busy hammers closing rivets up,
==14==Give dreadful note of preparation.
==15==The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
==16==And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
==17==Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
==18==The confident and overlusty French
==19==Do the low-rated English play at dice;
==20==And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night,
==21==Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp
==22==So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
==23==Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
==24==Sit patiently and inly ruminate
==25==The morning’s danger; and their gesture sad,
==26==Investing lank-lean cheeks and war-worn coats,
==27==Presented them unto the gazing moon
==28==So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
==29==The royal captain of this ruin’d band
==30==Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
==31==Let him cry, “Praise and glory on his head!”
==32==For forth he goes, and visits all his host,
==33==Bids them good morrow with a modest smile,
==34==And calls them brothers, friends, and countrymen.
==35==Upon his royal face there is no note
==36==How dread an army hath enrounded him;
==37==Nor doth he dedicate one jot of color
==38==Unto the weary and all-watched night;
==39==But freshly looks, and overbears attaint
==40==With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
==41==That every wretch, pining and pale before,
==42==Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks.
==43==A largess universal, like the sun,
==44==His liberal eye doth give to every one,
==45==Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all
==46==Behold, as may unworthiness define,
==47==A little touch of Harry in the night.
==48==And so our scene must to the battle fly;
==49==Where—O for pity!—we shall much disgrace
==50==With four or five most vile and ragged foils
==51==(Right ill dispos’d, in brawl ridiculous) 
==52==The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
==53==Minding true things by what their mock’ries be.


*Exit.*
