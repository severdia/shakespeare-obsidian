## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Southampton. A council-chamber.*

*Enter Exeter, Bedford, and Westmorland.*

**BED.**
==1==’Fore God, his Grace is bold to trust these traitors.

**EXE.**
==2==They shall be apprehended by and by.

**WEST.**
==3==How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
==4==As if allegiance in their bosoms sate
==5==Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.

**BED.**
==6==The King hath note of all that they intend,
==7==By interception which they dream not of.

**EXE.**
==8==Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
==9==Whom he hath dull’d and cloy’d with gracious favors⁠—
==10==That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
==11==His sovereign’s life to death and treachery.

*Sound trumpets. Enter the King, Scroop, Cambridge, and Grey, with Attendants.*

**K. HEN.**
==12==Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
==13==My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
==14==And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts.
==15==Think you not that the pow’rs we bear with us
==16==Will cut their passage through the force of France,
==17==Doing the execution and the act
==18==For which we have in head assembled them?

**SCROOP.**
==19==No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.

**K. HEN.**
==20==I doubt not that, since we are well persuaded
==21==We carry not a heart with us from hence
==22==That grows not in a fair consent with ours;
==23==Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
==24==Success and conquest to attend on us.

**CAM.**
==25==Never was monarch better fear’d and lov’d
==26==Than is your Majesty. There’s not, I think, a subject
==27==That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
==28==Under the sweet shade of your government.

**GREY.**
==29==True; those that were your father’s enemies
==30==Have steep’d their galls in honey, and do serve you
==31==With hearts create of duty and of zeal.

**K. HEN.**
==32==We therefore have great cause of thankfulness,
==33==And shall forget the office of our hand
==34==Sooner than quittance of desert and merit,
==35==According to the weight and worthiness.

**SCROOP.**
==36==So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
==37==And labor shall refresh itself with hope
==38==To do your Grace incessant services.

**K. HEN.**
==39==We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
==40==Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
==41==That rail’d against our person. We consider
==42==It was excess of wine that set him on,
==43==And on his more advice we pardon him.

**SCROOP.**
==44==That’s mercy, but too much security.
==45==Let him be punish’d, sovereign, lest example
==46==Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.

**K. HEN.**
==47==O, let us yet be merciful.

**CAM.**
==48==So may your Highness, and yet punish too.

**GREY.**
==49==Sir,
==50==You show great mercy if you give him life
==51==After the taste of much correction.

**K. HEN.**
==52==Alas, your too much love and care of me
==53==Are heavy orisons ’gainst this poor wretch!
==54==If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
==55==Shall not be wink’d at, how shall we stretch our eye
==56==When capital crimes, chew’d, swallow’d, and digested,
==57==Appear before us? We’ll yet enlarge that man,
==58==Though Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, in their dear care
==59==And tender preservation of our person,
==60==Would have him punish’d. And now to our French causes.
==61==Who are the late commissioners?

**CAM.**
==62==I one, my lord.
==63==Your Highness bade me ask for it today.

**SCROOP.**
==64==So did you me, my liege.

**GREY.**
==65==And I, my royal sovereign.

**K. HEN.**
==66==Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
==67==There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,
==68==Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
==69==Read them, and know I know your worthiness.
==70==My Lord of Westmorland, and uncle Exeter,
==71==We will aboard tonight.—Why, how now, gentlemen?
==72==What see you in those papers that you lose
==73==So much complexion?—Look ye how they change!
==74==Their cheeks are paper.—Why, what read you there
==75==That have so cowarded and chas’d your blood
==76==Out of appearance?

**CAM.**
==76==           I do confess my fault,
==77==And do submit me to your Highness’ mercy.

**GREY. AND SCROOP.**
==78==To which we all appeal.

**K. HEN.**
==79==The mercy that was quick in us but late,
==80==By your own counsel is suppress’d and kill’d.
==81==You must not dare (for shame) to talk of mercy,
==82==For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
==83==As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
==84==See you, my princes and my noble peers,
==85==These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,
==86==You know how apt our love was to accord
==87==To furnish him with all appertinents
==88==Belonging to his honor; and this man
==89==Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspir’d
==90==And sworn unto the practices of France
==91==To kill us here in Hampton. To the which
==92==This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
==93==Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But O,
==94==What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop, thou cruel,
==95==Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature?
==96==Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
==97==That knew’st the very bottom of my soul,
==98==That (almost) mightst have coin’d me into gold,
==99==Wouldst thou have practic’d on me, for thy use?
==100==May it be possible that foreign hire
==101==Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
==102==That might annoy my finger? ’Tis so strange,
==103==That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
==104==As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
==105==Treason and murder ever kept together,
==106==As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose,
==107==Working so grossly in a natural cause
==108==That admiration did not hoop at them;
==109==But thou (’gainst all proportion) didst bring in
==110==Wonder to wait on treason and on murder;
==111==And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
==112==That wrought upon thee so preposterously
==113==Hath got the voice in hell for excellence;
==114==And other devils that suggest by treasons
==115==Do botch and bungle up damnation
==116==With patches, colors, and with forms being fetch’d
==117==From glist’ring semblances of piety;
==118==But he that temper’d thee, bade thee stand up,
==119==Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
==120==Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
==121==If that same demon that hath gull’d thee thus
==122==Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
==123==He might return to vasty Tartar back,
==124==And tell the legions, “I can never win
==125==A soul so easy as that Englishman’s.”
==126==O, how hast thou with jealousy infected
==127==The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
==128==Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learned?
==129==Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?
==130==Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?
==131==Why, so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet,
==132==Free from gross passion, or of mirth or anger,
==133==Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
==134==Garnish’d and deck’d in modest complement,
==135==Not working with the eye without the ear,
==136==And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
==137==Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.
==138==And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot
==139==To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
==140==With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
==141==For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
==142==Another fall of man. Their faults are open,
==143==Arrest them to the answer of the law,
==144==And God acquit them of their practices!

**EXE.**
==145==I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Richard, Earl of Cambridge.
==146==I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Henry, Lord Scroop of Masham.
==147==I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.

**SCROOP.**
==148==Our purposes God justly hath discover’d,
==149==And I repent my fault more than my death,
==150==Which I beseech your Highness to forgive,
==151==Although my body pay the price of it.

**CAM.**
==152==For me, the gold of France did not seduce,
==153==Although I did admit it as a motive
==154==The sooner to effect what I intended.
==155==But God be thanked for prevention,
==156==Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
==157==Beseeching God, and you, to pardon me.

**GREY.**
==158==Never did faithful subject more rejoice
==159==At the discovery of most dangerous treason
==160==Than I do at this hour joy o’er myself,
==161==Prevented from a damned enterprise.
==162==My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.

**K. HEN.**
==163==God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
==164==You have conspir’d against our royal person,
==165==Join’d with an enemy proclaim’d, and from his coffers
==166==Receiv’d the golden earnest of our death;
==167==Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
==168==His princes and his peers to servitude,
==169==His subjects to oppression and contempt,
==170==And his whole kingdom into desolation.
==171==Touching our person seek we no revenge,
==172==But we our kingdom’s safety must so tender,
==173==Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
==174==We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
==175==Poor miserable wretches, to your death;
==176==The taste whereof God of his mercy give
==177==You patience to endure, and true repentance
==178==Of all your dear offenses! Bear them hence.
*(Exeunt Cambridge, Scroop, and Grey, guarded.)*
==179==Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
==180==Shall be to you as us, like glorious.
==181==We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
==182==Since God so graciously hath brought to light
==183==This dangerous treason lurking in our way
==184==To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
==185==But every rub is smoothed on our way.
==186==Then forth, dear countrymen! Let us deliver
==187==Our puissance into the hand of God,
==188==Putting it straight in expedition.
==189==Cheerly to sea! The signs of war advance!
==190==No king of England, if not king of France!

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
