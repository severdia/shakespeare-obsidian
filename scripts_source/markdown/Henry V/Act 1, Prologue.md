## Act 1, Prologue
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 1|Act 1, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Chorus.*

**CHORUS.**
==1==O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
==2==The brightest heaven of invention!
==3==A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,
==4==And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
==5==Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
==6==Assume the port of Mars, and at his heels
==7==(Leash’d in, like hounds) should famine, sword, and fire
==8==Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,
==9==The flat unraised spirits that hath dar’d
==10==On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
==11==So great an object. Can this cockpit hold
==12==The vasty fields of France? Or may we cram
==13==Within this wooden O the very casques
==14==That did affright the air at Agincourt?
==15==O, pardon! Since a crooked figure may
==16==Attest in little place a million,
==17==And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
==18==On your imaginary forces work.
==19==Suppose within the girdle of these walls
==20==Are now confin’d two mighty monarchies,
==21==Whose high, upreared, and abutting fronts
==22==The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder.
==23==Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
==24==Into a thousand parts divide one man,
==25==And make imaginary puissance;
==26==Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them
==27==Printing their proud hoofs i’ th’ receiving earth;
==28==For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
==29==Carry them here and there, jumping o’er times,
==30==Turning th’ accomplishment of many years
==31==Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
==32==Admit me Chorus to this history;
==33==Who, Prologue-like, your humble patience pray,
==34==Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.


*Exit.*
