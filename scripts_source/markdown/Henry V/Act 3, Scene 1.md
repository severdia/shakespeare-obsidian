## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Prologue|← Act 3, Prologue]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*France. Before Harfleur.*

*Enter the King, Exeter, Bedford, and Gloucester. Alarum. Enter Soldiers with scaling-ladders at Harfleur.*

**K. HEN.**
==1==Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
==2==Or close the wall up with our English dead.
==3==In peace there’s nothing so becomes a man
==4==As modest stillness and humility;
==5==But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
==6==Then imitate the action of the tiger;
==7==Stiffen the sinews, conjure up the blood,
==8==Disguise fair nature with hard-favor’d rage;
==9==Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
==10==Let it pry through the portage of the head
==11==Like the brass cannon; let the brow o’erwhelm it
==12==As fearfully as doth a galled rock
==13==O’erhang and jutty his confounded base,
==14==Swill’d with the wild and wasteful ocean.
==15==Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
==16==Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit
==17==To his full height. On, on, you noblest English,
==18==Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
==19==Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
==20==Have in these parts from morn till even fought,
==21==And sheath’d their swords for lack of argument.
==22==Dishonor not your mothers; now attest
==23==That those whom you call’d fathers did beget you.
==24==Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
==25==And teach them how to war. And you, good yeomen,
==26==Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
==27==The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
==28==That you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not;
==29==For there is none of you so mean and base
==30==That hath not noble luster in your eyes.
==31==I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
==32==Straining upon the start. The game’s afoot!
==33==Follow your spirit; and upon this charge
==34==Cry, “God for Harry, England, and Saint George!”

*Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go off.*
