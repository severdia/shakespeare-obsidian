## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*The Duke of Lancaster’s palace.*

*Enter John of Gaunt with the Duchess of Gloucester.*

**GAUNT.**
==1==Alas, the part I had in Woodstock’s blood
==2==Doth more solicit me than your exclaims
==3==To stir against the butchers of his life!
==4==But since correction lieth in those hands
==5==Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
==6==Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,
==7==Who, when they see the hour’s ripe on earth,
==8==Will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads.

**DUCH.**
==9==Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
==10==Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
==11==Edward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
==12==Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
==13==Or seven fair branches springing from one root.
==14==Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course,
==15==Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
==16==But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
==17==One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood,
==18==One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
==19==Is crack’d, and all the precious liquor spilt,
==20==Is hack’d down, and his summer leaves all faded,
==21==By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe.
==22==Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,
==23==That mettle, that self mould, that fashioned thee
==24==Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
==25==Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent
==26==In some large measure to thy father’s death,
==27==In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
==28==Who was the model of thy father’s life.
==29==Call it not patience, Gaunt, it is despair.
==30==In suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaught’red,
==31==Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
==32==Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.
==33==That which in mean men we entitle patience
==34==Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
==35==What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life
==36==The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.

**GAUNT.**
==37==God’s is the quarrel, for God’s substitute,
==38==His deputy anointed in His sight,
==39==Hath caus’d his death, the which if wrongfully,
==40==Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift
==41==An angry arm against His minister.

**DUCH.**
==42==Where then, alas, may I complain myself?

**GAUNT.**
==43==To God, the widow’s champion and defense.

**DUCH.**
==44==Why then I will. Farewell, old Gaunt!
==45==Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
==46==Our cousin Herford and fell Mowbray fight.
==47==O, sit my husband’s wrongs on Herford’s spear,
==48==That it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast!
==49==Or if misfortune miss the first career,
==50==Be Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom
==51==That they may break his foaming courser’s back,
==52==And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
==53==A caitiff recreant to my cousin Herford!
==54==Farewell, old Gaunt! Thy sometimes brother’s wife
==55==With her companion, grief, must end her life.

**GAUNT.**
==56==Sister, farewell, I must to Coventry.
==57==As much good stay with thee as go with me!

**DUCH.**
==58==Yet one word more! Grief boundeth where it falls,
==59==Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.
==60==I take my leave before I have begun,
==61==For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
==62==Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
==63==Lo this is all—nay, yet depart not so;
==64==Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
==65==I shall remember more. Bid him—ah, what?⁠—
==66==With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
==67==Alack, and what shall good old York there see
==68==But empty lodgings and unfurnish’d walls,
==69==Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
==70==And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
==71==Therefore commend me; let him not come there
==72==To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
==73==Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
==74==The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

*Exeunt.*
