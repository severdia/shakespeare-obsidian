## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*London. A street leading to the Tower.*

*Enter the Queen with her Attendants.*

**QUEEN.**
==1== This way the King will come, this is the way
==2== To Julius Caesar’s ill-erected tower,
==3== To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
==4== Is doom’d a prisoner by proud Bullingbrook.
==5== Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
==6== Have any resting for her true king’s queen.
*(Enter Richard and Guard.)*
==7== But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
==8== My fair rose wither; yet look up, behold,
==9== That you in pity may dissolve to dew
==10== And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
==11== Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
==12== Thou map of honor, thou King Richard’s tomb,
==13== And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
==14== Why should hard-favor’d grief be lodg’d in thee,
==15== When triumph is become an alehouse guest?

**K. RICH.**
==16== Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
==17== To make my end too sudden. Learn, good soul,
==18== To think our former state a happy dream,
==19== From which awak’d, the truth of what we are
==20== Shows us but this. I am sworn brother, sweet,
==21== To grim Necessity, and he and I
==22== Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France,
==23== And cloister thee in some religious house.
==24== Our holy lives must win a new world’s crown,
==25== Which our profane hours here have thrown down.

**QUEEN.**
==26== What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
==27== Transform’d and weak’ned? Hath Bullingbrook depos’d
==28== Thine intellect? Hath he been in thy heart?
==29== The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
==30== And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
==31== To be o’erpow’r’d, and wilt thou, pupil-like,
==32== Take the correction, mildly kiss the rod,
==33== And fawn on rage with base humility,
==34== Which art a lion and the king of beasts?

**K. RICH.**
==35== A king of beasts indeed—if aught but beasts,
==36== I had been still a happy king of men.
==37== Good sometimes queen, prepare thee hence for France.
==38== Think I am dead, and that even here thou takest,
==39== As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
==40== In winter’s tedious nights sit by the fire
==41== With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
==42== Of woeful ages long ago betid;
==43== And ere thou bid good night, to quite their griefs,
==44== Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,
==45== And send the hearers weeping to their beds.
==46== For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
==47== The heavy accent of thy moving tongue,
==48== And in compassion weep the fire out,
==49== And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
==50== For the deposing of a rightful king.

*Enter Northumberland and others.*

**NORTH.**
==51== My lord, the mind of Bullingbrook is chang’d,
==52== You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
==53== And, madam, there is order ta’en for you,
==54== With all swift speed you must away to France.

**K. RICH.**
==55== Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
==56== The mounting Bullingbrook ascends my throne,
==57== The time shall not be many hours of age
==58== More than it is, ere foul sin gathering head
==59== Shall break into corruption. Thou shalt think,
==60== Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
==61== It is too little, helping him to all;
==62== He shall think that thou, which knowest the way
==63== To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
==64== Being ne’er so little urg’d, another way
==65== To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
==66== The love of wicked men converts to fear,
==67== That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
==68== To worthy danger and deserved death.

**NORTH.**
==69== My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
==70== Take leave and part, for you must part forthwith.

**K. RICH.**
==71== Doubly divorc’d! Bad men, you violate
==72== A twofold marriage—’twixt my crown and me,
==73== And then betwixt me and my married wife.⁠—
==74== Let me unkiss the oath ’twixt thee and me;
==75== And yet not so, for with a kiss ’twas made.
==76== Part us, Northumberland: I towards the north,
==77== Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
==78== My wife to France, from whence set forth in pomp
==79== She came adorned hither like sweet May,
==80== Sent back like Hallowmas or short’st of day.

**QUEEN.**
==81== And must we be divided? Must we part?

**K. RICH.**
==82== Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.

**QUEEN.**
==83== Banish us both, and send the King with me.

**NORTH.**
==84== That were some love, but little policy.

**QUEEN.**
==85== Then whither he goes, thither let me go.

**K. RICH.**
==86== So two together weeping make one woe.
==87== Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
==88== Better far off than, near, be ne’er the near.
==89== Go count thy way with sighs, I mine with groans.

**QUEEN.**
==90== So longest way shall have the longest moans.

**K. RICH.**
==91== Twice for one step I’ll groan, the way being short,
==92== And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
==93== Come, come, in wooing sorrow let’s be brief,
==94== Since wedding it, there is such length in grief.
==95== One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
==96== Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.

**QUEEN.**
==97== Give me mine own again, ’twere no good part
==98== To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
==99== So now I have mine own again, be gone,
==100== That I may strive to kill it with a groan.

**K. RICH.**
==101== We make woe wanton with this fond delay,
==102== Once more, *adieu*, the rest let sorrow say.

*Exeunt.*
