## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*The court.*

*Enter the King with Green and Bagot at one door and the Lord Aumerle at another.*

**K. RICH.**
==1==We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
==2==How far brought you high Herford on his way?

**AUM.**
==3==I brought high Herford, if you call him so,
==4==But to the next high way, and there I left him.

**K. RICH.**
==5==And say, what store of parting tears were shed?

**AUM.**
==6==Faith, none for me, except the northeast wind,
==7==Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
==8==Awak’d the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
==9==Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

**K. RICH.**
==10==What said our cousin when you parted with him?

**AUM.**
==11==“Farewell!”
==12==And for my heart disdained that my tongue
==13==Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
==14==To counterfeit oppression of such grief
==15==That words seem’d buried in my sorrow’s grave.
==16==Marry, would the word “farewell” have length’ned hours
==17==And added years to his short banishment,
==18==He should have had a volume of farewells;
==19==But since it would not, he had none of me.

**K. RICH.**
==20==He is our cousin’s cousin, but ’tis doubt,
==21==When time shall call him home from banishment,
==22==Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
==23==Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green,
==24==Observ’d his courtship to the common people,
==25==How he did seem to dive into their hearts
==26==With humble and familiar courtesy,
==27==What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
==28==Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
==29==And patient underbearing of his fortune,
==30==As ’twere to banish their affects with him.
==31==Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench,
==32==A brace of draymen bid God speed him well,
==33==And had the tribute of his supple knee,
==34==With “Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends,”
==35==As were our England in reversion his,
==36==And he our subjects’ next degree in hope.

**GREEN.**
==37==Well, he is gone, and with him go these thoughts.
==38==Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
==39==Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
==40==Ere further leisure yield them further means
==41==For their advantage and your Highness’ loss.

**K. RICH.**
==42==We will ourself in person to this war,
==43==And for our coffers, with too great a court
==44==And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
==45==We are enforc’d to farm our royal realm,
==46==The revenue whereof shall furnish us
==47==For our affairs in hand. If that come short,
==48==Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters,
==49==Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
==50==They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold,
==51==And send them after to supply our wants,
==52==For we will make for Ireland presently.
*(Enter Bushy.)*
==53==Bushy, what news?

**BUSHY.**
==54==Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
==55==Suddenly taken, and hath sent post-haste
==56==To entreat your Majesty to visit him.

**K. RICH.**
==57==Where lies he?

**BUSHY.**
==58==At Ely House.

**K. RICH.**
==59==Now put it, God, in the physician’s mind
==60==To help him to his grave immediately!
==61==The lining of his coffers shall make coats
==62==To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
==63==Come, gentlemen, let’s all go visit him.
==64==Pray God we may make haste and come too late!

**ALL GREEN., BAGOT., AUM., BUSHY.**
==65==Amen.

*Exeunt.*
