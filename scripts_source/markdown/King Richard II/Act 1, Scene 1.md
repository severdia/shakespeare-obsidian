## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*London. King Richard’s palace.*

*Enter King Richard, John of Gaunt, with other Nobles and Attendants.*

**K. RICH.**
==1==Old John of Gaunt, time-honored Lancaster,
==2==Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
==3==Brought hither Henry Herford thy bold son,
==4==Here to make good the boist’rous late appeal,
==5==Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
==6==Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

**GAUNT.**
==7==I have, my liege.

**K. RICH.**
==8==Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
==9==If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,
==10==Or worthily, as a good subject should,
==11==On some known ground of treachery in him?

**GAUNT.**
==12==As near as I could sift him on that argument,
==13==On some apparent danger seen in him
==14==Aim’d at your Highness, no inveterate malice.

**K. RICH.**
==15==Then call them to our presence; face to face,
==16==And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
==17==The accuser and the accused freely speak.
==18==High-stomach’d are they both and full of ire,
==19==In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

*Enter Bullingbrook and Mowbray with Attendants.*

**BULL.**
==20==Many years of happy days befall
==21==My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!

**MOW.**
==22==Each day still better other’s happiness,
==23==Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,
==24==Add an immortal title to your crown!

**K. RICH.**
==25==We thank you both, yet one but flatters us,
==26==As well appeareth by the cause you come:
==27==Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.
==28==Cousin of Herford, what dost thou object
==29==Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

**BULL.**
==30==First, heaven be the record to my speech,
==31==In the devotion of a subject’s love,
==32==Tend’ring the precious safety of my prince,
==33==And free from other misbegotten hate,
==34==Come I appellant to this princely presence.
==35==Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
==36==And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
==37==My body shall make good upon this earth,
==38==Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
==39==Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
==40==Too good to be so, and too bad to live,
==41==Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
==42==The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
==43==Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
==44==With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat,
==45==And wish (so please my sovereign) ere I move,
==46==What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.

**MOW.**
==47==Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.
==48==’Tis not the trial of a woman’s war,
==49==The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,
==50==Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
==51==The blood is hot that must be cool’d for this.
==52==Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
==53==As to be hush’d and nought at all to say.
==54==First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me
==55==From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,
==56==Which else would post until it had return’d
==57==These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
==58==Setting aside his high blood’s royalty,
==59==And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
==60==I do defy him, and I spit at him,
==61==Call him a slanderous coward, and a villain,
==62==Which to maintain I would allow him odds
==63==And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
==64==Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
==65==Or any other ground inhabitable
==66==Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
==67==Mean time, let this defend my loyalty:
==68==By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

**BULL.**
==69==Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
==70==Disclaiming here the kindred of the King,
==71==And lay aside my high blood’s royalty,
==72==Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
==73==If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
==74==As to take up mine honor’s pawn, then stoop.
==75==By that, and all the rites of knighthood else,
==76==Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
==77==What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.

**MOW.**
==78==I take it up, and by that sword I swear
==79==Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
==80==I’ll answer thee in any fair degree
==81==Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;
==82==And when I mount, alive may I not light,
==83==If I be traitor or unjustly fight!

**K. RICH.**
==84==What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge?
==85==It must be great that can inherit us
==86==So much as of a thought of ill in him.

**BULL.**
==87==Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true:
==88==That Mowbray hath receiv’d eight thousand nobles
==89==In name of lendings for your Highness’ soldiers,
==90==The which he hath detain’d for lewd employments,
==91==Like a false traitor and injurious villain;
==92==Besides I say, and will in battle prove,
==93==Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
==94==That ever was surveyed by English eye,
==95==That all the treasons for these eighteen years,
==96==Complotted and contrived in this land,
==97==Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
==98==Further I say, and further will maintain
==99==Upon his bad life to make all this good,
==100==That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,
==101==Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
==102==And consequently, like a traitor coward,
==103==Sluic’d out his innocent soul through streams of blood,
==104==Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries,
==105==Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
==106==To me for justice and rough chastisement;
==107==And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
==108==This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.

**K. RICH.**
==109==How high a pitch his resolution soars!
==110==Thomas of Norfolk, what say’st thou to this?

**MOW.**
==111==O, let my sovereign turn away his face,
==112==And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
==113==Till I have told this slander of his blood
==114==How God and good men hate so foul a liar.

**K. RICH.**
==115==Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.
==116==Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom’s heir,
==117==As he is but my father’s brother’s son,
==118==Now by my scepter’s awe I make a vow,
==119==Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood
==120==Should nothing privilege him nor partialize
==121==The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.
==122==He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.
==123==Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.

**MOW.**
==124==Then, Bullingbrook, as low as to thy heart
==125==Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest.
==126==Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice
==127==Disburs’d I duly to his Highness’ soldiers;
==128==The other part reserv’d I by consent,
==129==For that my sovereign liege was in my debt,
==130==Upon remainder of a dear account,
==131==Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.
==132==Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,
==133==I slew him not, but to my own disgrace
==134==Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
==135==For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
==136==The honorable father to my foe,
==137==Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
==138==A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;
==139==But ere I last receiv’d the sacrament
==140==I did confess it, and exactly begg’d
==141==Your Grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.
==142==This is my fault. As for the rest appeal’d,
==143==It issues from the rancor of a villain,
==144==A recreant and most degenerate traitor,
==145==Which in myself I boldly will defend,
==146==And interchangeably hurl down my gage
==147==Upon this overweening traitor’s foot,
==148==To prove myself a loyal gentleman
==149==Even in the best blood chamber’d in his bosom,
==150==In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
==151==Your Highness to assign our trial day.

**K. RICH.**
==152==Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul’d by me,
==153==Let’s purge this choler without letting blood.
==154==This we prescribe, though no physician;
==155==Deep malice makes too deep incision.
==156==Forget, forgive, conclude and be agreed,
==157==Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
==158==Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
==159==We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.

**GAUNT.**
==160==To be a make-peace shall become my age.
==161==Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.

**K. RICH.**
==162==And, Norfolk, throw down his.

**GAUNT.**
==162==                When, Harry? When?
==163==Obedience bids I should not bid again.

**K. RICH.**
==164==Norfolk, throw down, we bid, there is no boot.

**MOW.**
==165==Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot,
==166==My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
==167==The one my duty owes, but my fair name,
==168==Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
==169==To dark dishonor’s use thou shalt not have.
==170==I am disgrac’d, impeach’d, and baffled here,
==171==Pierc’d to the soul with slander’s venom’d spear,
==172==The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
==173==Which breath’d this poison.

**K. RICH.**
==173==              Rage must be withstood,
==174==Give me his gage. Lions make leopards tame.

**MOW.**
==175==Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,
==176==And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
==177==The purest treasure mortal times afford
==178==Is spotless reputation; that away,
==179==Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
==180==A jewel in a ten-times-barr’d-up chest
==181==Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
==182==Mine honor is my life, both grow in one,
==183==Take honor from me, and my life is done.
==184==Then, dear my liege, mine honor let me try;
==185==In that I live, and for that will I die.

**K. RICH.**
==186==Cousin, throw up your gage, do you begin.

**BULL.**
==187==O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
==188==Shall I seem crestfallen in my father’s sight?
==189==Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
==190==Before this outdar’d dastard? Ere my tongue
==191==Shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong,
==192==Or sound so base a parley, my teeth shall tear
==193==The slavish motive of recanting fear,
==194==And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
==195==Where shame doth harbor, even in Mowbray’s face.

*Exit Gaunt.*

**K. RICH.**
==196==We were not born to sue, but to command,
==197==Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
==198==Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
==199==At Coventry upon Saint Lambert’s day.
==200==There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
==201==The swelling difference of your settled hate.
==202==Since we cannot atone you, we shall see
==203==Justice design the victor’s chivalry.
==204==Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms
==205==Be ready to direct these home alarms.

*Exeunt.*
