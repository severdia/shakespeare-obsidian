## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Westminster Hall.*

*Enter Bullingbrook with the Lords Aumerle, Northumberland, Percy, Fitzwater, Surrey, the Bishop of Carlisle, the Abbot of Westminster, and another Lord to parliament; Herald.*

**BULL.**
==1== Call forth Bagot.
*(Enter Officers with Bagot.)*
==2== Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind,
==3== What thou dost know of noble Gloucester’s death,
==4== Who wrought it with the King, and who perform’d
==5== The bloody office of his timeless end.

**BAGOT.**
==6== Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.

**BULL.**
==7== Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.

**BAGOT.**
==8== My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
==9== Scorns to unsay what once it hath delivered.
==10== In that dead time when Gloucester’s death was plotted,
==11== I heard you say, “Is not my arm of length,
==12== That reacheth from the restful English court
==13== As far as Callice, to mine uncle’s head?”
==14== Amongst much other talk, that very time,
==15== I heard you say that you had rather refuse
==16== The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
==17== Than Bullingbrook’s return to England,
==18== Adding withal, how blest this land would be
==19== In this your cousin’s death.

**AUM.**
==19==               Princes and noble lords,
==20== What answer shall I make to this base man?
==21== Shall I so much dishonor my fair stars
==22== On equal terms to give him chastisement?
==23== Either I must, or have mine honor soil’d
==24== With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
==25== There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
==26== That marks thee out for hell. I say thou liest,
==27== And will maintain what thou hast said is false
==28== In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
==29== To stain the temper of my knightly sword.

**BULL.**
==30== Bagot, forbear, thou shalt not take it up.

**AUM.**
==31== Excepting one, I would he were the best
==32== In all this presence that hath mov’d me so.

**FITZ.**
==33== If that thy valor stand on sympathy,
==34== There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine.
==35== By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand’st,
==36== I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak’st it,
==37== That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester’s death.
==38== If thou deniest it twenty times, thou liest,
==39== And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
==40== Where it was forged, with my rapier’s point.

**AUM.**
==41== Thou dar’st not, coward, live to see that day.

**FITZ.**
==42== Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.

**AUM.**
==43== Fitzwater, thou art damn’d to hell for this.

**PERCY.**
==44== Aumerle, thou liest, his honor is as true
==45== In this appeal as thou art all unjust,
==46== And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
==47== To prove it on thee to the extremest point
==48== Of mortal breathing. Seize it, if thou dar’st.

**AUM.**
==49== And if I do not, may my hands rot off,
==50== And never brandish more revengeful steel
==51== Over the glittering helmet of my foe!

**ANOTHER LORD.**
==52== I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle,
==53== And spur thee on with full as many lies
==54== As may be hollowed in thy treacherous ear
==55== From sun to sun. There is my honor’s pawn,
==56== Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.

**AUM.**
==57== Who sets me else? By heaven, I’ll throw at all!
==58== I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
==59== To answer twenty thousand such as you.

**SURREY.**
==60== My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
==61== The very time Aumerle and you did talk.

**FITZ.**
==62== ’Tis very true, you were in presence then,
==63== And you can witness with me this is true.

**SURREY.**
==64== As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.

**FITZ.**
==65== Surrey, thou liest.

**SURREY.**
==65==            Dishonorable boy!
==66== That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
==67== That it shall render vengeance and revenge
==68== Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
==69== In earth as quiet as thy father’s skull;
==70== In proof whereof, there is my honor’s pawn,
==71== Engage it to the trial, if thou dar’st.

**FITZ.**
==72== How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
==73== If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
==74== I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
==75== And spit upon him whilst I say he lies,
==76== And lies, and lies. There is my bond of faith,
==77== To tie thee to my strong correction.
==78== As I intend to thrive in this new world,
==79== Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal;
==80== Besides, I heard the banished Norfolk say
==81== That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
==82== To execute the noble Duke at Callice.

**AUM.**
==83== Some honest Christian trust me with a gage⁠—
==84== That Norfolk lies, here do I throw down this,
==85== If he may be repeal’d to try his honor.

**BULL.**
==86== These differences shall all rest under gage
==87== Till Norfolk be repeal’d. Repeal’d he shall be,
==88== And though mine enemy, restor’d again
==89== To all his lands and signories. When he is return’d,
==90== Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.

**CAR.**
==91== That honorable day shall never be seen.
==92== Many a time hath banish’d Norfolk fought
==93== For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
==94== Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
==95== Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens,
==96== And toil’d with works of war, retir’d himself
==97== To Italy, and there at Venice gave
==98== His body to that pleasant country’s earth,
==99== And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
==100== Under whose colors he had fought so long.

**BULL.**
==101== Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?

**CAR.**
==102== As surely as I live, my lord.

**BULL.**
==103== Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
==104== Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
==105== Your differences shall all rest under gage
==106== Till we assign you to your days of trial.

*Enter York attended.*

**YORK.**
==107== Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
==108== From plume-pluck’d Richard, who with willing soul
==109== Adopts thee heir, and his high scepter yields
==110== To the possession of thy royal hand.
==111== Ascend his throne, descending now from him,
==112== And long live Henry, fourth of that name!

**BULL.**
==113== In God’s name I’ll ascend the regal throne.

**CAR.**
==114== Marry, God forbid!
==115== Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
==116== Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
==117== Would God that any in this noble presence
==118== Were enough noble to be upright judge
==119== Of noble Richard! Then true noblesse would
==120== Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
==121== What subject can give sentence on his king?
==122== And who sits here that is not Richard’s subject?
==123== Thieves are not judg’d but they are by to hear,
==124== Although apparent guilt be seen in them,
==125== And shall the figure of God’s majesty,
==126== His captain, steward, deputy, elect,
==127== Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
==128== Be judg’d by subject and inferior breath,
==129== And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
==130== That in a Christian climate souls refin’d
==131== Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
==132== I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
==133== Stirr’d up by God, thus boldly for his king.
==134== My Lord of Herford here, whom you call king,
==135== Is a foul traitor to proud Herford’s king,
==136== And if you crown him, let me prophesy,
==137== The blood of English shall manure the ground,
==138== And future ages groan for this foul act.
==139== Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
==140== And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
==141== Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound.
==142== Disorder, horror, fear, and mutiny
==143== Shall here inhabit, and this land be call’d
==144== The field of Golgotha and dead men’s skulls.
==145== O, if you raise this house against this house,
==146== It will the woefullest division prove
==147== That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
==148== Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
==149== Lest child, child’s children, cry against you “woe!”

**NORTH.**
==150== Well have you argued, sir, and, for your pains,
==151== Of capital treason we arrest you here.
==152== My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
==153== To keep him safely till his day of trial.
==154== May it please you, lords, to grant the commons’ suit?

**BULL.**
==155== Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
==156== He may surrender; so we shall proceed
==157== Without suspicion.

**YORK.**
==157==            I will be his conduct.

*Exit.*

**BULL.**
==158== Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
==159== Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
==160== Little are we beholding to your love,
==161== And little look’d for at your helping hands.

*Enter Richard and York with Officers bearing the crown and scepter.*

**K. RICH.**
==162== Alack, why am I sent for to a king
==163== Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
==164== Wherewith I reign’d? I hardly yet have learn’d
==165== To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my knee.
==166== Give sorrow leave a while to tutor me
==167== To this submission. Yet I well remember
==168== The favors of these men. Were they not mine?
==169== Did they not sometimes cry “All hail!” to me?
==170== So Judas did to Christ; but He, in twelve,
==171== Found truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand, none.
==172== God save the King! Will no man say amen?
==173== Am I both priest and clerk? Well then, amen.
==174== God save the King! Although I be not he,
==175== And yet amen, if heaven do think him me.
==176== To do what service am I sent for hither?

**YORK.**
==177== To do that office of thine own good will
==178== Which tired majesty did make thee offer:
==179== The resignation of thy state and crown
==180== To Henry Bullingbrook.

**K. RICH.**
==181== Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
==182== Here, cousin,
==183== On this side my hand, and on that side thine.
==184== Now is this golden crown like a deep well
==185== That owes two buckets, filling one another,
==186== The emptier ever dancing in the air,
==187== The other down, unseen, and full of water:
==188== That bucket down and full of tears am I,
==189== Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.

**BULL.**
==190== I thought you had been willing to resign.

**K. RICH.**
==191== My crown I am, but still my griefs are mine.
==192== You may my glories and my state depose,
==193== But not my griefs; still am I king of those.

**BULL.**
==194== Part of your cares you give me with your crown.

**K. RICH.**
==195== Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down:
==196== My care is loss of care, by old care done,
==197== Your care is gain of care, by new care won;
==198== The cares I give I have, though given away,
==199== They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.

**BULL.**
==200== Are you contented to resign the crown?

**K. RICH.**
==201== Ay, no, no ay; for I must nothing be;
==202== Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
==203== Now mark me how I will undo myself:
==204== I give this heavy weight from off my head,
==205== And this unwieldy scepter from my hand,
==206== The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
==207== With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
==208== With mine own hands I give away my crown,
==209== With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
==210== With mine own breath release all duteous oaths;
==211== All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
==212== My manors, rents, revenues I forgo;
==213== My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny;
==214== God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
==215== God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!
==216== Make me, that nothing have, with nothing griev’d,
==217== And thou with all pleas’d, that hast all achiev’d!
==218== Long mayst thou live in Richard’s seat to sit,
==219== And soon lie Richard in an earthy pit!
==220== God save King Henry, unking’d Richard says,
==221== And send him many years of sunshine days!
==222== What more remains?

**NORTH.**
==222==            No more, but that you read
*(Presenting a paper.)*
==223== These accusations, and these grievous crimes
==224== Committed by your person and your followers
==225== Against the state and profit of this land;
==226== That by confessing them, the souls of men
==227== May deem that you are worthily depos’d.

**K. RICH.**
==228== Must I do so? And must I ravel out
==229== My weav’d-up follies? Gentle Northumberland,
==230== If thy offenses were upon record,
==231== Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
==232== To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
==233== There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
==234== Containing the deposing of a king,
==235== And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
==236== Mark’d with a blot, damn’d in the book of heaven.
==237== Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me
==238== Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
==239== Though some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands,
==240== Showing an outward pity, yet you Pilates
==241== Have here deliver’d me to my sour cross,
==242== And water cannot wash away your sin.

**NORTH.**
==243== My lord, dispatch, read o’er these articles.

**K. RICH.**
==244== Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see;
==245== And yet salt water blinds them not so much
==246== But they can see a sort of traitors here.
==247== Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
==248== I find myself a traitor with the rest;
==249== For I have given here my soul’s consent
==250== T’ undeck the pompous body of a king;
==251== Made glory base, and sovereignty a slave;
==252== Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.

**NORTH.**
==253== My lord⁠—

**K. RICH.**
==254== No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
==255== Nor no man’s lord. I have no name, no title,
==256== No, not that name was given me at the font,
==257== But ’tis usurp’d. Alack the heavy day,
==258== That I have worn so many winters out
==259== And know not now what name to call myself!
==260== O that I were a mockery king of snow,
==261== Standing before the sun of Bullingbrook,
==262== To melt myself away in water-drops!
==263== Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
==264== And if my word be sterling yet in England,
==265== Let it command a mirror hither straight,
==266== That it may show me what a face I have
==267== Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.

**BULL.**
==268== Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.

*Exit an Attendant.*

**NORTH.**
==269== Read o’er this paper while the glass doth come.

**K. RICH.**
==270== Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell!

**BULL.**
==271== Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.

**NORTH.**
==272== The commons will not then be satisfied.

**K. RICH.**
==273== They shall be satisfied. I’ll read enough,
==274== When I do see the very book indeed
==275== Where all my sins are writ, and that’s myself.
*(Enter Attendant with a glass.)*
==276== Give me that glass, and therein will I read.
==277== No deeper wrinkles yet? Hath sorrow struck
==278== So many blows upon this face of mine,
==279== And made no deeper wounds? O flatt’ring glass,
==280== Like to my followers in prosperity,
==281== Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
==282== That every day under his household roof
==283== Did keep ten thousand men? Was this the face
==284== That like the sun, did make beholders wink?
==285== Is this the face which fac’d so many follies,
==286== That was at last out-fac’d by Bullingbrook?
==287== A brittle glory shineth in this face,
==288== As brittle as the glory is the face,
*(Dashes the glass against the ground.)*
==289== For there it is, crack’d in an hundred shivers.
==290== Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
==291== How soon my sorrow hath destroy’d my face.

**BULL.**
==292== The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy’d
==293== The shadow of your face.

**K. RICH.**
==293==               Say that again.
==294== The shadow of my sorrow! Ha, let’s see.
==295== ’Tis very true, my grief lies all within,
==296== And these external manners of laments
==297== Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
==298== That swells with silence in the tortur’d soul.
==299== There lies the substance; and I thank thee, King,
==300== For thy great bounty, that not only giv’st
==301== Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way
==302== How to lament the cause. I’ll beg one boon,
==303== And then be gone and trouble you no more.
==304== Shall I obtain it?

**BULL.**
==304==            Name it, fair cousin.

**K. RICH.**
==305== “Fair cousin”? I am greater than a king;
==306== For when I was a king my flatterers
==307== Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
==308== I have a king here to my flatterer.
==309== Being so great, I have no need to beg.

**BULL.**
==310== Yet ask.

**K. RICH.**
==311== And shall I have?

**BULL.**
==312== You shall.

**K. RICH.**
==313== Then give me leave to go.

**BULL.**
==314== Whither?

**K. RICH.**
==315== Whither you will, so I were from your sights.

**BULL.**
==316== Go some of you, convey him to the Tower.

**K. RICH.**
==317== O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all,
==318== That rise thus nimbly by a true king’s fall.

*Exeunt Richard, some Lords, and a Guard.*

**BULL.**
==319== On Wednesday next we solemnly proclaim
==320== Our coronation. Lords, be ready all.

*Exeunt. Manent Abbot of Westminster, Carlisle, Aumerle.*

**ABBOT.**
==321== A woeful pageant have we here beheld.

**CAR.**
==322== The woe’s to come; the children yet unborn
==323== Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.

**AUM.**
==324== You holy clergymen, is there no plot
==325== To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?

**ABBOT.**
==326== My lord,
==327== Before I freely speak my mind herein,
==328== You shall not only take the sacrament
==329== To bury mine intents, but also to effect
==330== What ever I shall happen to devise.
==331== I see your brows are full of discontent,
==332== Your hearts of sorrow, and your eyes of tears.
==333== Come home with me to supper, I’ll lay
==334== A plot shall show us all a merry day.

*Exeunt.*
