## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*Bristol. Before the castle.*

*Enter Bullingbrook, Duke of Herford, York, Northumberland, Ross, Percy, Willoughby, with Bushy and Green prisoners.*

**BULL.**
==1==Bring forth these men.
==2==Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls⁠—
==3==Since presently your souls must part your bodies⁠—
==4==With too much urging your pernicious lives,
==5==For ’twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
==6==From off my hands, here in the view of men
==7==I will unfold some causes of your deaths:
==8==You have misled a prince, a royal king,
==9==A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
==10==By you unhappied and disfigured clean;
==11==You have in manner with your sinful hours
==12==Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
==13==Broke the possession of a royal bed,
==14==And stain’d the beauty of a fair queen’s cheeks
==15==With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs;
==16==Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
==17==Near to the King in blood, and near in love
==18==Till you did make him misinterpret me,
==19==Have stoop’d my neck under your injuries,
==20==And sigh’d my English breath in foreign clouds,
==21==Eating the bitter bread of banishment,
==22==Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
==23==Dispark’d my parks and fell’d my forest woods,
==24==From my own windows torn my household coat,
==25==Ras’d out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
==26==Save men’s opinions and my living blood,
==27==To show the world I am a gentleman.
==28==This and much more, much more than twice all this,
==29==Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over
==30==To execution and the hand of death.

**BUSHY.**
==31==More welcome is the stroke of death to me
==32==Than Bullingbrook to England. Lords, farewell!

**GREEN.**
==33==My comfort is, that heaven will take our souls,
==34==And plague injustice with the pains of hell.

**BULL.**
==35==My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch’d.
*(Exeunt Northumberland and others with the prisoners.)*
==36==Uncle, you say the Queen is at your house,
==37==For God’s sake fairly let her be entreated.
==38==Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
==39==Take special care my greetings be delivered.

**YORK.**
==40==A gentleman of mine I have dispatch’d
==41==With letters of your love to her at large.

**BULL.**
==42==Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,
==43==To fight with Glendower and his complices.
==44==A while to work, and after holiday.

*Exeunt.*
