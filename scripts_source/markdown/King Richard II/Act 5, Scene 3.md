## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*A royal palace.*

*Enter the King Henry with his nobles Percy and other Lords.*

**K. HEN.**
==1==Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
==2==’Tis full three months since I did see him last.
==3==If any plague hang over us, ’tis he.
==4==I would to God, my lords, he might be found.
==5==Inquire at London, ’mongst the taverns there,
==6==For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
==7==With unrestrained loose companions,
==8==Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes
==9==And beat our watch and rob our passengers,
==10==Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
==11==Takes on the point of honor to support
==12==So dissolute a crew.

**PERCY.**
==13==My lord, some two days since I saw the Prince,
==14==And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.

**K. HEN.**
==15==And what said the gallant?

**PERCY.**
==16==His answer was, he would unto the stews,
==17==And from the common’st creature pluck a glove
==18==And wear it as a favor, and with that
==19==He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.

**K. HEN.**
==20==As dissolute as desperate, yet through both
==21==I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
==22==May happily bring forth. But who comes here?

*Enter Aumerle amazed.*

**AUM.**
==23==Where is the King?

**K. HEN.**
==24==What means our cousin, that he stares and looks
==25==So wildly?

**AUM.**
==26==God save your Grace! I do beseech your Majesty,
==27==To have some conference with your Grace alone.

**K. HEN.**
==28==Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
*(Exeunt Percy and Lords.)*
==29==What is the matter with our cousin now?

**AUM.**
==30==Forever may my knees grow to the earth,
*(Kneels.)*
==31==My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth,
==32==Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.

**K. HEN.**
==33==Intended, or committed, was this fault?
==34==If on the first, how heinous e’er it be,
==35==To win thy after-love I pardon thee.

**AUM.**
==36==Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
==37==That no man enter till my tale be done.

**K. HEN.**
==38==Have thy desire.

*Aumerle locks the door. The Duke of York knocks at the door and crieth.*

**YORK.**
*(Within.)*
==39==My liege, beware! Look to thyself,
==40==Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.

**K. HEN.**
==41==Villain, I’ll make thee safe.

*Draws.*

**AUM.**
==42==Stay thy revengeful hand, thou hast no cause to fear.

**YORK.**
*(Within.)*
==43==Open the door, secure foolhardy King!
==44==Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?
==45==Open the door, or I will break it open.

*King Henry unlocks the door.*

*Enter York.*

**K. HEN.**
==46==What is the matter, uncle? Speak,
==47==Recover breath, tell us how near is danger
==48==That we may arm us to encounter it.

**YORK.**
==49==Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
==50==The treason that my haste forbids me show.

**AUM.**
==51==Remember, as thou read’st, thy promise pass’d.
==52==I do repent me, read not my name there,
==53==My heart is not confederate with my hand.

**YORK.**
==54==It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
==55==I tore it from the traitor’s bosom, King;
==56==Fear, and not love, begets his penitence.
==57==Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
==58==A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.

**K. HEN.**
==59==O heinous, strong, and bold conspiracy!
==60==O loyal father of a treacherous son!
==61==Thou sheer, immaculate, and silver fountain,
==62==From whence this stream through muddy passages
==63==Hath held his current and defil’d himself!
==64==Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
==65==And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
==66==This deadly blot in thy digressing son.

**YORK.**
==67==So shall my virtue be his vice’s bawd,
==68==An’ he shall spend mine honor with his shame,
==69==As thriftless sons their scraping fathers’ gold.
==70==Mine honor lives when his dishonor dies,
==71==Or my sham’d life in his dishonor lies:
==72==Thou kill’st me in his life; giving him breath,
==73==The traitor lives, the true man’s put to death.

**DUCH. YORK.**
*(Within.)*
==74==What ho, my liege! For God’s sake let me in.

**K. HEN.**
==75==What shrill-voic’d suppliant makes this eager cry?

**DUCH. YORK.**
*(Within.)*
==76==A woman, and thy aunt, great King, ’tis I.
==77==Speak with me, pity me, open the door!
==78==A beggar begs that never begg’d before.

**K. HEN.**
==79==Our scene is alt’red from a serious thing,
==80==And now chang’d to “The Beggar and the King.”
==81==My dangerous cousin, let your mother in,
==82==I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.

**YORK.**
==83==If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
==84==More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
==85==This fest’red joint cut off, the rest rest sound,
==86==This let alone will all the rest confound.

*Enter Duchess of York.*

**DUCH. YORK.**
==87==O King, believe not this hard-hearted man!
==88==Love loving not itself, none other can.

**YORK.**
==89==Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
==90==Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?

**DUCH. YORK.**
==91==Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.

*Kneels.*

**K. HEN.**
==92==Rise up, good aunt.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==92==           Not yet, I thee beseech.
==93==Forever will I walk upon my knees,
==94==And never see day that the happy sees,
==95==Till thou give joy, until thou bid me joy
==96==By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.

**AUM.**
==97==Unto my mother’s prayers I bend my knee.

*Kneels.*

**YORK.**
==98==Against them both my true joints bended be.
*(Kneels.)*
==99==Ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace!

**DUCH. YORK.**
==100==Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face:
==101==His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest,
==102==His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast;
==103==He prays but faintly, and would be denied,
==104==We pray with heart and soul, and all beside;
==105==His weary joints would gladly rise, I know,
==106==Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow;
==107==His prayers are full of false hypocrisy,
==108==Ours of true zeal and deep integrity;
==109==Our prayers do outpray his, then let them have
==110==That mercy which true prayer ought to have.

**K. HEN.**
==111==Good aunt, stand up.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==111==           Nay, do not say “stand up”;
==112==Say “pardon” first, and afterwards “stand up.”
==113==And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
==114==“Pardon” should be the first word of thy speech.
==115==I never long’d to hear a word till now,
==116==Say “pardon,” King, let pity teach thee how.
==117==The word is short, but not so short as sweet,
==118==No word like “pardon” for kings’ mouths so meet.

**YORK.**
==119==Speak it in French, King, say *“pardonne moy”*.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==120==Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
==121==Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
==122==That sets the word itself against the word!
==123==Speak “pardon” as ’tis current in our land,
==124==The chopping French we do not understand.
==125==Thine eye begins to speak, set thy tongue there;
==126==Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear,
==127==That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
==128==Pity may move thee “pardon” to rehearse.

**K. HEN.**
==129==Good aunt, stand up.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==129==           I do not sue to stand;
==130==Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.

**K. HEN.**
==131==I pardon him as God shall pardon me.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==132==O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
==133==Yet am I sick for fear, speak it again,
==134==Twice saying “pardon” doth not pardon twain,
==135==But makes one pardon strong.

**K. HEN.**
==135==                With all my heart
==136==I pardon him.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==136==        A god on earth thou art.

**K. HEN.**
==137==But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
==138==With all the rest of that consorted crew,
==139==Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
==140==Good uncle, help to order several powers
==141==To Oxford, or where e’er these traitors are.
==142==They shall not live within this world, I swear,
==143==But I will have them if I once know where.
==144==Uncle, farewell, and, cousin, *adieu*!
==145==Your mother well hath pray’d, and prove you true.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==146==Come, my old son, I pray God make thee new.

*Exeunt.*
