## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Wales. Before Flint Castle.*

*Enter, with Drum and Colors, Bullingbrook, York, Northumberland, Attendants, and forces.*

**BULL.**
==1==So that by this intelligence we learn
==2==The Welshmen are dispers’d, and Salisbury
==3==Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed
==4==With some few private friends upon this coast.

**NORTH.**
==5==The news is very fair and good, my lord:
==6==Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.

**YORK.**
==7==It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
==8==To say King Richard. Alack the heavy day
==9==When such a sacred king should hide his head!

**NORTH.**
==10==Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief
==11==Left I his title out.

**YORK.**
==11==           The time hath been,
==12==Would you have been so brief with him, he would
==13==Have been so brief with you to shorten you,
==14==For taking so the head, your whole head’s length.

**BULL.**
==15==Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.

**YORK.**
==16==Take not, good cousin, further than you should,
==17==Lest you mistake the heavens are over our heads.

**BULL.**
==18==I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
==19==Against their will. But who comes here?
*(Enter Harry Percy.)*
==20==Welcome, Harry. What, will not this castle yield?

**PERCY.**
==21==The castle royally is mann’d, my lord,
==22==Against thy entrance.

**BULL.**
==23==Royally?
==24==Why, it contains no king.

**PERCY.**
==24==              Yes, my good lord,
==25==It doth contain a king. King Richard lies
==26==Within the limits of yon lime and stone,
==27==And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
==28==Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
==29==Of holy reverence, who, I cannot learn.

**NORTH.**
==30==O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.

**BULL.**
*(To Northumberland.)*
==31==Noble lord,
==32==Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
==33==Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
==34==Into his ruin’d ears, and thus deliver:
==35==Henry Bullingbrook
==36==On both his knees doth kiss King Richard’s hand,
==37==And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
==38==To his most royal person; hither come
==39==Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
==40==Provided that my banishment repeal’d
==41==And lands restor’d again be freely granted.
==42==If not, I’ll use the advantage of my power,
==43==And lay the summer’s dust with show’rs of blood
==44==Rain’d from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen,
==45==The which, how far off from the mind of Bullingbrook
==46==It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
==47==The fresh green lap of fair King Richard’s land,
==48==My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
==49==Go signify as much, while here we march
==50==Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
*(Northumberland advances to the castle, with a Trumpet.)*
==51==Let’s march without the noise of threat’ning drum,
==52==That from this castle’s tattered battlements
==53==Our fair appointments may be well perus’d.
==54==Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
==55==With no less terror than the elements
==56==Of fire and water, when their thund’ring shock
==57==At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
==58==Be he the fire, I’ll be the yielding water;
==59==The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
==60==My waters—on the earth, and not on him.
==61==March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
*(The trumpets sound parle without and answer within; then a flourish.)*
*(Richard appeareth on the walls with Carlisle, Aumerle, Scroop, Salisbury.)*
==62==See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
==63==As doth the blushing discontented sun
==64==From out the fiery portal of the east,
==65==When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
==66==To dim his glory and to stain the track
==67==Of his bright passage to the occident.

**YORK.**
==68==Yet looks he like a king! Behold, his eye,
==69==As bright as is the eagle’s, lightens forth
==70==Controlling majesty. Alack, alack for woe,
==71==That any harm should stain so fair a show!

**K. RICH.**
*(To Northumberland.)*
==72==We are amaz’d, and thus long have we stood
==73==To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
==74==Because we thought ourself thy lawful king;
==75==And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
==76==To pay their aweful duty to our presence?
==77==If we be not, show us the hand of God
==78==That hath dismiss’d us from our stewardship,
==79==For well we know no hand of blood and bone
==80==Can gripe the sacred handle of our scepter,
==81==Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
==82==And though you think that all, as you have done,
==83==Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
==84==And we are barren and bereft of friends,
==85==Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
==86==Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
==87==Armies of pestilence, and they shall strike
==88==Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
==89==That lift your vassal hands against my head,
==90==And threat the glory of my precious crown.
==91==Tell Bullingbrook—for yon methinks he stands⁠—
==92==That every stride he makes upon my land
==93==Is dangerous treason. He is come to open
==94==The purple testament of bleeding war;
==95==But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
==96==Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers’ sons
==97==Shall ill become the flower of England’s face,
==98==Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
==99==To scarlet indignation, and bedew
==100==Her pasters’ grass with faithful English blood.

**NORTH.**
==101==The King of heaven forbid our lord the King
==102==Should so with civil and uncivil arms
==103==Be rush’d upon! Thy thrice-noble cousin,
==104==Harry Bullingbrook, doth humbly kiss thy hand,
==105==And by the honorable tomb he swears
==106==That stands upon your royal grandsire’s bones,
==107==And by the royalties of both your bloods,
==108==Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
==109==And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
==110==And by the worth and honor of himself,
==111==Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
==112==His coming hither hath no further scope
==113==Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg
==114==Enfranchisement immediate on his knees,
==115==Which on thy royal party granted once,
==116==His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
==117==His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
==118==To faithful service of your Majesty.
==119==This swears he, as he is a prince, is just,
==120==And as I am a gentleman I credit him.

**K. RICH.**
==121==Northumberland, say thus the King returns:
==122==His noble cousin is right welcome hither,
==123==And all the number of his fair demands
==124==Shall be accomplish’d without contradiction.
==125==With all the gracious utterance thou hast
==126==Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
*(Northumberland withdraws to Bullingbrook.)*
*(To Aumerle.)*
==127==We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
==128==To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
==129==Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
==130==Defiance to the traitor, and so die?

**AUM.**
==131==No, good my lord, let’s fight with gentle words.
==132==Till time lend friends, and friends their helpful swords.

**K. RICH.**
==133==O God, O God, that e’er this tongue of mine
==134==That laid the sentence of dread banishment
==135==On yon proud man should take it off again
==136==With words of sooth! O that I were as great
==137==As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
==138==Or that I could forget what I have been!
==139==Or not remember what I must be now!
==140==Swell’st thou, proud heart? I’ll give thee scope to beat,
==141==Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.

**AUM.**
==142==Northumberland comes back from Bullingbrook.

**K. RICH.**
==143==What must the King do now? Must he submit?
==144==The King shall do it. Must he be depos’d?
==145==The King shall be contented. Must he lose
==146==The name of king? A’ God’s name let it go.
==147==I’ll give my jewels for a set of beads,
==148==My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
==149==My gay apparel for an almsman’s gown,
==150==My figur’d goblets for a dish of wood,
==151==My scepter for a palmer’s walking-staff,
==152==My subjects for a pair of carved saints,
==153==And my large kingdom for a little grave,
==154==A little little grave, an obscure grave⁠—
==155==Or I’ll be buried in the king’s high way,
==156==Some way of common trade, where subjects’ feet
==157==May hourly trample on their sovereign’s head;
==158==For on my heart they tread now whilst I live,
==159==And buried once, why not upon my head?
==160==Aumerle, thou weep’st, my tender-hearted cousin!
==161==We’ll make foul weather with despised tears;
==162==Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
==163==And make a dearth in this revolting land.
==164==Or shall we play the wantons with our woes
==165==And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
==166==As thus to drop them still upon one place,
==167==Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
==168==Within the earth, and, therein laid—there lies
==169==Two kinsmen digg’d their graves with weeping eyes.
==170==Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
==171==I talk but idlely, and you laugh at me.
==172==Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
==173==What says King Bullingbrook? Will his Majesty
==174==Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
==175==You make a leg, and Bullingbrook says ay.

**NORTH.**
==176==My lord, in the base court he doth attend
==177==To speak with you, may it please you to come down.

**K. RICH.**
==178==Down, down I come, like glist’ring Phaëton,
==179==Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
==180==In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
==181==To come at traitors’ calls and do them grace.
==182==In the base court, come down? Down court! Down king!
==183==For night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.

*Exeunt above.*

**BULL.**
==184==What says his Majesty?

**NORTH.**
==184==              Sorrow and grief of heart
==185==Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man,
==186==Yet he is come.

*Enter King Richard and his Attendants below.*

**BULL.**
==187==Stand all apart,
==188==And show fair duty to his Majesty.
*(He kneels down.)*
==189==My gracious lord⁠—

**K. RICH.**
==190==Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
==191==To make the base earth proud with kissing it.
==192==Me rather had my heart might feel your love
==193==Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
==194==Up, cousin, up, your heart is up, I know,
==195==Thus high at least
*(Touching his crown.)*
==195==           although your knee be low.

**BULL.**
==196==My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.

**K. RICH.**
==197==Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.

**BULL.**
==198==So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
==199==As my true service shall deserve your love.

**K. RICH.**
==200==Well you deserve; they well deserve to have
==201==That know the strong’st and surest way to get.
==202==Uncle, give me your hands; nay, dry your eyes⁠—
==203==Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
==204==Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
==205==Though you are old enough to be my heir.
==206==What you will have, I’ll give, and willing too,
==207==For do we must what force will have us do.
==208==Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?

**BULL.**
==209==Yea, my good lord.

**K. RICH.**
==209==           Then I must not say no.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
