## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*The lists at Coventry.*

*Enter Lord Marshal and the Duke Aumerle.*

**MAR.**
==1==My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Herford arm’d?

**AUM.**
==2==Yea, at all points, and longs to enter in.

**MAR.**
==3==The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
==4==Stays but the summons of the appellant’s trumpet.

**AUM.**
==5==Why then the champions are prepar’d, and stay
==6==For nothing but his Majesty’s approach.

*The trumpets sound, and the King enters with his nobles Gaunt, Bushy, Bagot, Green, and others. When they are set, enter Mowbray, the Duke of Norfolk, in arms, defendant, with a Herald.*

**K. RICH.**
==7==Marshal, demand of yonder champion
==8==The cause of his arrival here in arms;
==9==Ask him his name, and orderly proceed
==10==To swear him in the justice of his cause.

**MAR.**
==11==In God’s name and the King’s, say who thou art
==12==And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
==13==Against what man thou com’st, and what thy quarrel.
==14==Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath,
==15==As so defend thee heaven and thy valor!

**MOW.**
==16==My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
==17==Who hither come engaged by my oath
==18==(Which God defend a knight should violate!) 
==19==Both to defend my loyalty and truth
==20==To God, my king, and my succeeding issue,
==21==Against the Duke of Herford that appeals me,
==22==And by the grace of God, and this mine arm,
==23==To prove him, in defending of myself,
==24==A traitor to my God, my king, and me⁠—
==25==And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

*The trumpets sound. Enter Bullingbrook, Duke of Herford, appellant, in armor, with a Herald.*

**K. RICH.**
==26==Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
==27==Both who he is and why he cometh hither
==28==Thus plated in habiliments of war,
==29==And formally, according to our law,
==30==Depose him in the justice of his cause.

**MAR.**
==31==What is thy name? And wherefore com’st thou hither
==32==Before King Richard in his royal lists?
==33==Against whom com’st thou? And what’s thy quarrel?
==34==Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!

**BULL.**
==35==Harry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby
==36==Am I, who ready here do stand in arms
==37==To prove by God’s grace, and my body’s valor,
==38==In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
==39==That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
==40==To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me⁠—
==41==And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!

**MAR.**
==42==On pain of death, no person be so bold
==43==Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
==44==Except the Marshal and such officers
==45==Appointed to direct these fair designs.

**BULL.**
==46==Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign’s hand
==47==And bow my knee before his Majesty,
==48==For Mowbray and myself are like two men
==49==That vow a long and weary pilgrimage.
==50==Then let us take a ceremonious leave
==51==And loving farewell of our several friends.

**MAR.**
==52==The appellant in all duty greets your Highness,
==53==And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.

**K. RICH.**
==54==We will descend and fold him in our arms.
==55==Cousin of Herford, as thy cause is right,
==56==So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
==57==Farewell, my blood, which if today thou shed,
==58==Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.

**BULL.**
==59==O, let no noble eye profane a tear
==60==For me, if I be gor’d with Mowbray’s spear.
==61==As confident as is the falcon’s flight
==62==Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
==63==My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
==64==Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
==65==Not sick, although I have to do with death,
==66==But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
==67==Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
==68==The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
==69==O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
==70==Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
==71==Doth with a twofold vigor lift me up
==72==To reach at victory above my head,
==73==Add proof unto mine armor with thy prayers,
==74==And with thy blessings steel my lance’s point,
==75==That it may enter Mowbray’s waxen coat,
==76==And furbish new the name of John a’ Gaunt,
==77==Even in the lusty havior of his son.

**GAUNT.**
==78==God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
==79==Be swift like lightning in the execution,
==80==And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
==81==Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
==82==Of thy adverse pernicious enemy.
==83==Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.

**BULL.**
==84==Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive!

**MOW.**
==85==However God or fortune cast my lot,
==86==There lives or dies, true to King Richard’s throne,
==87==A loyal, just, and upright gentleman.
==88==Never did captive with a freer heart
==89==Cast off his chains of bondage, and embrace
==90==His golden uncontroll’d enfranchisement,
==91==More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
==92==This feast of battle with mine adversary.
==93==Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
==94==Take from my mouth the wish of happy years.
==95==As gentle and as jocund as to jest
==96==Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.

**K. RICH.**
==97==Farewell, my lord, securely I espy
==98==Virtue with valor couched in thine eye.
==99==Order the trial, Marshal, and begin.

**MAR.**
==100==Harry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby,
==101==Receive thy lance, and God defend the right!

**BULL.**
==102==Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.

**MAR.**
*(To an Officer.)*
==103==Go bear this lance to Thomas Duke of Norfolk,

**1. HER.**
==104==Harry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby
==105==Stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself,
==106==On pain to be found false and recreant,
==107==To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
==108==A traitor to his God, his king, and him,
==109==And dares him to set forward to the fight.

**2. HER.**
==110==Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
==111==On pain to be found false and recreant,
==112==Both to defend himself and to approve
==113==Henry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby
==114==To God, his sovereign, and to him disloyal,
==115==Courageously, and with a free desire,
==116==Attending but the signal to begin.

**MAR.**
==117==Sound, trumpets, and set forward, combatants.
*(A charge sounded.)*
==118==Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down.

**K. RICH.**
==119==Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
==120==And both return back to their chairs again.
==121==Withdraw with us, and let the trumpets sound
==122==While we return these dukes what we decree.
*(A long flourish.)*
==123==Draw near,
==124==And list what with our Council we have done:
==125==For that our kingdom’s earth should not be soil’d
==126==With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
==127==And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
==128==Of civil wounds plough’d up with neighbors’ sword;
==129==And for we think the eagle-winged pride
==130==Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
==131==With rival-hating envy, set on you
==132==To wake our peace, which in our country’s cradle
==133==Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
==134==Which so rous’d up with boist’rous untun’d drums,
==135==With harsh-resounding trumpets’ dreadful bray,
==136==And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
==137==Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace,
==138==And make us wade even in our kindred’s blood:
==139==Therefore we banish you our territories.
==140==You, cousin Herford, upon pain of life,
==141==Till twice five summers have enrich’d our fields
==142==Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
==143==But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

**BULL.**
==144==Your will be done. This must my comfort be,
==145==That sun that warms you here shall shine on me,
==146==And those his golden beams to you here lent
==147==Shall point on me and gild my banishment.

**K. RICH.**
==148==Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
==149==Which I with same unwillingness pronounce:
==150==The sly, slow hours shall not determinate
==151==The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
==152==The hopeless word of “never to return”
==153==Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.

**MOW.**
==154==A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
==155==And all unlook’d for from your Highness’ mouth.
==156==A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
==157==As to be cast forth in the common air,
==158==Have I deserved at your Highness’ hands.
==159==The language I have learnt these forty years,
==160==My native English, now I must forgo,
==161==And now my tongue’s use is to me no more
==162==Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
==163==Or like a cunning instrument cas’d up,
==164==Or being open, put into his hands
==165==That knows no touch to tune the harmony.
==166==Within my mouth you have enjail’d my tongue,
==167==Doubly portcullis’d with my teeth and lips,
==168==And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
==169==Is made my jailer to attend on me.
==170==I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
==171==Too far in years to be a pupil now.
==172==What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
==173==Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?

**K. RICH.**
==174==It boots thee not to be compassionate,
==175==After our sentence plaining comes too late.

**MOW.**
==176==Then thus I turn me from my country’s light,
==177==To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.

**K. RICH.**
==178==Return again, and take an oath with thee.
==179==Lay on our royal sword your banish’d hands;
==180==Swear by the duty that y’ owe to God
==181==(Our part therein we banish with yourselves) 
==182==To keep the oath that we administer:
==183==You never shall, so help you truth and God,
==184==Embrace each other’s love in banishment,
==185==Nor never look upon each other’s face,
==186==Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
==187==This low’ring tempest of your home-bred hate,
==188==Nor never by advised purpose meet
==189==To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
==190==’Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.

**BULL.**
==191==I swear.

**MOW.**
==192==And I, to keep all this.

**BULL.**
==193==Norfolk, so fare as to mine enemy:
==194==By this time, had the King permitted us,
==195==One of our souls had wand’red in the air,
==196==Banish’d this frail sepulcher of our flesh,
==197==As now our flesh is banish’d from this land;
==198==Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
==199==Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
==200==The clogging burden of a guilty soul.

**MOW.**
==201==No, Bullingbrook, if ever I were traitor,
==202==My name be blotted from the book of life,
==203==And I from heaven banish’d as from hence!
==204==But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know,
==205==And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue.
==206==Farewell, my liege, now no way can I stray;
==207==Save back to England, all the world’s my way.

*Exit.*

**K. RICH.**
==208==Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
==209==I see thy grieved heart. Thy sad aspect
==210==Hath from the number of his banish’d years
==211==Pluck’d four away.
*(To Bullingbrook.)*
==211==           Six frozen winters spent,
==212==Return with welcome home from banishment.

**BULL.**
==213==How long a time lies in one little word!
==214==Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
==215==End in a word: such is the breath of kings.

**GAUNT.**
==216==I thank my liege that in regard of me
==217==He shortens four years of my son’s exile,
==218==But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
==219==For ere the six years that he hath to spend
==220==Can change their moons and bring their times about,
==221==My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
==222==Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
==223==My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
==224==And blindfold Death not let me see my son.

**K. RICH.**
==225==Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.

**GAUNT.**
==226==But not a minute, King, that thou canst give.
==227==Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
==228==And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
==229==Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
==230==But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
==231==Thy word is current with him for my death,
==232==But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.

**K. RICH.**
==233==Thy son is banish’d upon good advice,
==234==Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave.
==235==Why at our justice seem’st thou then to low’r?

**GAUNT.**
==236==Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
==237==You urg’d me as a judge, but I had rather
==238==You would have bid me argue like a father.
==239==O, had’t been a stranger, not my child,
==240==To smooth his fault I should have been more mild.
==241==A partial slander sought I to avoid,
==242==And in the sentence my own life destroyed.
==243==Alas, I look’d when some of you should say
==244==I was too strict to make mine own away;
==245==But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
==246==Against my will to do myself this wrong.

**K. RICH.**
==247==Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.
==248==Six years we banish him, and he shall go.

*Flourish. Exit with his Train.*

**AUM.**
==249==Cousin, farewell! What presence must not know,
==250==From where you do remain let paper show.

**MAR.**
==251==My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride,
==252==As far as land will let me, by your side.

**GAUNT.**
==253==O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
==254==That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?

**BULL.**
==255==I have too few to take my leave of you,
==256==When the tongue’s office should be prodigal
==257==To breathe the abundant dolor of the heart.

**GAUNT.**
==258==Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.

**BULL.**
==259==Joy absent, grief is present for that time.

**GAUNT.**
==260==What is six winters? They are quickly gone.

**BULL.**
==261==To men in joy, but grief makes one hour ten.

**GAUNT.**
==262==Call it a travel that thou tak’st for pleasure.

**BULL.**
==263==My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
==264==Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.

**GAUNT.**
==265==The sullen passage of thy weary steps
==266==Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
==267==The precious jewel of thy home return.

**BULL.**
==268==Nay rather, every tedious stride I make
==269==Will but remember me what a deal of world
==270==I wander from the jewels that I love.
==271==Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
==272==To foreign passages, and in the end,
==273==Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
==274==But that I was a journeyman to grief?

**GAUNT.**
==275==All places that the eye of heaven visits
==276==Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
==277==Teach thy necessity to reason thus:
==278==There is no virtue like necessity.
==279==Think not the King did banish thee,
==280==But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit
==281==Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
==282==Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honor,
==283==And not the King exil’d thee; or suppose
==284==Devouring pestilence hangs in our air,
==285==And thou art flying to a fresher clime.
==286==Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
==287==To lie that way thou goest, not whence thou com’st.
==288==Suppose the singing birds musicians,
==289==The grass whereon thou tread’st the presence strow’d,
==290==The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
==291==Than a delightful measure or a dance,
==292==For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
==293==The man that mocks at it and sets it light.

**BULL.**
==294==O, who can hold a fire in his hand
==295==By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
==296==Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
==297==By bare imagination of a feast?
==298==Or wallow naked in December snow
==299==By thinking on fantastic summer’s heat?
==300==O no, the apprehension of the good
==301==Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.
==302==Fell Sorrow’s tooth doth never rankle more
==303==Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.

**GAUNT.**
==304==Come, come, my son, I’ll bring thee on thy way;
==305==Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.

**BULL.**
==306==Then England’s ground, farewell, sweet soil, *adieu*;
==307==My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
==308==Where e’er I wander, boast of this I can,
==309==Though banish’d, yet a true-born Englishman.

*Exeunt.*
