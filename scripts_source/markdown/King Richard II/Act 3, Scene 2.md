## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*The coast of Wales. A castle in view.*

*Drums: flourish and colors. Enter the King, Aumerle, the Bishop of Carlisle, and Soldiers.*

**K. RICH.**
==1== Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?

**AUM.**
==2== Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air
==3== After your late tossing on the breaking seas?

**K. RICH.**
==4== Needs must I like it well; I weep for joy
==5== To stand upon my kingdom once again.
==6== Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
==7== Though rebels wound thee with their horses’ hoofs.
==8== As a long-parted mother with her child
==9== Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
==10== So weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
==11== And do thee favors with my royal hands.
==12== Feed not thy sovereign’s foe, my gentle earth,
==13== Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense,
==14== But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
==15== And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
==16== Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet,
==17== Which with usurping steps do trample thee.
==18== Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
==19== And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
==20== Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,
==21== Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
==22== Throw death upon thy sovereign’s enemies.
==23== Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords,
==24== This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones
==25== Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
==26== Shall falter under foul rebellion’s arms.

**CAR.**
==27== Fear not, my lord, that Power that made you king
==28== Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
==29== The means that heavens yield must be embrac’d,
==30== And not neglected; else heaven would,
==31== And we will not. Heaven’s offer we refuse,
==32== The proffered means of succors and redress.

**AUM.**
==33== He means, my lord, that we are too remiss,
==34== Whilst Bullingbrook, through our security,
==35== Grows strong and great in substance and in power.

**K. RICH.**
==36== Discomfortable cousin, know’st thou not
==37== That when the searching eye of heaven is hid
==38== Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
==39== Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
==40== In murders and in outrage boldly here,
==41== But when from under this terrestrial ball
==42== He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
==43== And darts his light through every guilty hole,
==44== Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,
==45== The cloak of night being pluck’d from off their backs,
==46== Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
==47== So when this thief, this traitor Bullingbrook,
==48== Who all this while hath revell’d in the night,
==49== Whilst we were wand’ring with the antipodes,
==50== Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
==51== His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
==52== Not able to endure the sight of day,
==53== But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
==54== Not all the water in the rough rude sea
==55== Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
==56== The breath of worldly men cannot depose
==57== The deputy elected by the Lord;
==58== For every man that Bullingbrook hath press’d
==59== To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
==60== God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
==61== A glorious angel; then if angels fight,
==62== Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
*(Enter Salisbury.)*
==63== Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?

**SAL.**
==64== Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
==65== Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue
==66== And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
==67== One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
==68== Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.
==69== O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
==70== And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
==71== Today, today, unhappy day, too late,
==72== Overthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state,
==73== For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead,
==74== Are gone to Bullingbrook, dispers’d and fled.

**AUM.**
==75== Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?

**K. RICH.**
==76== But now the blood of twenty thousand men
==77== Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
==78== And till so much blood thither come again,
==79== Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
==80== All souls that will be safe, fly from my side,
==81== For time hath set a blot upon my pride.

**AUM.**
==82== Comfort, my liege, remember who you are.

**K. RICH.**
==83== I had forgot myself, am I not king?
==84== Awake, thou coward majesty! Thou sleepest.
==85== Is not the king’s name twenty thousand names?
==86== Arm, arm, my name! A puny subject strikes
==87== At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
==88== Ye favorites of a king, are we not high?
==89== High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York
==90== Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?

*Enter Scroop.*

**SCROOP.**
==91== More health and happiness betide my liege
==92== Than can my care-tun’d tongue deliver him!

**K. RICH.**
==93== Mine ear is open, and my heart prepar’d,
==94== The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
==95== Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, ’twas my care,
==96== And what loss is it to be rid of care?
==97== Strives Bullingbrook to be as great as we?
==98== Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
==99== We’ll serve Him too, and be his fellow so.
==100== Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend,
==101== They break their faith to God as well as us.
==102== Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay:
==103== The worst is death, and death will have his day.

**SCROOP.**
==104== Glad am I that your Highness is so arm’d
==105== To bear the tidings of calamity.
==106== Like an unseasonable stormy day,
==107== Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
==108== As if the world were all dissolv’d to tears,
==109== So high above his limits swells the rage
==110== Of Bullingbrook, covering your fearful land
==111== With hard bright steel, and hearts harder than steel.
==112== White-beards have arm’d their thin and hairless scalps
==113== Against thy majesty; boys, with women’s voices,
==114== Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints
==115== In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;
==116== Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
==117== Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
==118== Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
==119== Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
==120== And all goes worse than I have power to tell.

**K. RICH.**
==121== Too well, too well thou tell’st a tale so ill.
==122== Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?
==123== What is become of Bushy? Where is Green?
==124== That they have let the dangerous enemy
==125== Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
==126== If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.
==127== I warrant they have made peace with Bullingbrook.

**SCROOP.**
==128== Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.

**K. RICH.**
==129== O villains, vipers, damn’d without redemption!
==130== Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
==131== Snakes, in my heart-blood warm’d, that sting my heart!
==132== Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
==133== Would they make peace? Terrible hell
==134== Make war upon their spotted souls for this!

**SCROOP.**
==135== Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
==136== Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.
==137== Again uncurse their souls, their peace is made
==138== With heads, and not with hands. Those whom you curse
==139== Have felt the worst of death’s destroying wound,
==140== And lie full low, grav’d in the hollow ground.

**AUM.**
==141== Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?

**SCROOP.**
==142== Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.

**AUM.**
==143== Where is the Duke my father with his power?

**K. RICH.**
==144== No matter where—of comfort no man speak:
==145== Let’s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs,
==146== Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes
==147== Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.
==148== Let’s choose executors and talk of wills;
==149== And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
==150== Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
==151== Our lands, our lives, and all are Bullingbrook’s,
==152== And nothing can we call our own but death,
==153== And that small model of the barren earth
==154== Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
==155== For God’s sake let us sit upon the ground
==156== And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
==157== How some have been depos’d, some slain in war,
==158== Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,
==159== Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping kill’d,
==160== All murdered—for within the hollow crown
==161== That rounds the mortal temples of a king
==162== Keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits,
==163== Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
==164== Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
==165== To monarchize, be fear’d, and kill with looks,
==166== Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
==167== As if this flesh which walls about our life
==168== Were brass impregnable; and humor’d thus,
==169== Comes at the last and with a little pin
==170== Bores thorough his castle wall, and farewell king!
==171== Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
==172== With solemn reverence, throw away respect,
==173== Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,
==174== For you have but mistook me all this while.
==175== I live with bread like you, feel want,
==176== Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
==177== How can you say to me I am a king?

**CAR.**
==178== My lord, wise men ne’er sit and wail their woes,
==179== But presently prevent the ways to wail;
==180== To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
==181== Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
==182== And so your follies fight against yourself.
==183== Fear, and be slain—no worse can come to fight,
==184== And fight and die is death destroying death,
==185== Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.

**AUM.**
==186== My father hath a power, inquire of him,
==187== And learn to make a body of a limb.

**K. RICH.**
==188== Thou chid’st me well. Proud Bullingbrook, I come
==189== To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
==190== This ague fit of fear is overblown,
==191== An easy task it is to win our own.
==192== Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
==193== Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.

**SCROOP.**
==194== Men judge by the complexion of the sky
==195== The state and inclination of the day;
==196== So may you by my dull and heavy eye:
==197== My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
==198== I play the torturer by small and small
==199== To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
==200== Your uncle York is join’d with Bullingbrook,
==201== And all your northern castles yielded up,
==202== And all your southern gentlemen in arms
==203== Upon his party.

**K. RICH.**
==203==         Thou hast said enough.
*(To Aumerle.)*
==204== Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
==205== Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
==206== What say you now? What comfort have we now?
==207== By heaven, I’ll hate him everlastingly
==208== That bids me be of comfort any more.
==209== Go to Flint castle, there I’ll pine away⁠—
==210== A king, woe’s slave, shall kingly woe obey.
==211== That power I have, discharge, and let them go
==212== To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
==213== For I have none. Let no man speak again
==214== To alter this, for counsel is but vain.

**AUM.**
==215== My liege, one word.

**K. RICH.**
==215==            He does me double wrong
==216== That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
==217== Discharge my followers, let them hence away,
==218== From Richard’s night to Bullingbrook’s fair day.

*Exeunt.*
