## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*A camp in Wales.*

*Enter Earl of Salisbury and a Welsh Captain.*

**CAP.**
==1==My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay’d ten days,
==2==And hardly kept our countrymen together,
==3==And yet we hear no tidings from the King,
==4==Therefore we will disperse ourselves. Farewell!

**SAL.**
==5==Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman.
==6==The King reposeth all his confidence in thee.

**CAP.**
==7==’Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay.
==8==The bay-trees in our country are all wither’d,
==9==And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven,
==10==The pale-fac’d moon looks bloody on the earth,
==11==And lean-look’d prophets whisper fearful change,
==12==Rich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap,
==13==The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
==14==The other to enjoy by rage and war.
==15==These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
==16==Farewell! Our countrymen are gone and fled,
==17==As well assured Richard their king is dead.

*Exit.*

**SAL.**
==18==Ah, Richard! With the eyes of heavy mind
==19==I see thy glory like a shooting star
==20==Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
==21==Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
==22==Witnessing storms to come, woe, and unrest.
==23==Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
==24==And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

*Exit.*
