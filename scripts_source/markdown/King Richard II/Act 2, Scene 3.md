## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Wilds in Gloucestershire.*

*Enter Bullingbrook, Duke of Herford, Northumberland, and forces.*

**BULL.**
==1==How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?

**NORTH.**
==2==Believe me, noble lord,
==3==I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.
==4==These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
==5==Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome,
==6==And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
==7==Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
==8==But I bethink me what a weary way
==9==From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found
==10==In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
==11==Which, I protest, hath very much beguil’d
==12==The tediousness and process of my travel.
==13==But theirs is sweet’ned with the hope to have
==14==The present benefit which I possess,
==15==And hope to joy is little less in joy
==16==Than hope enjoyed. By this the weary lords
==17==Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
==18==By sight of what I have, your noble company.

**BULL.**
==19==Of much less value is my company
==20==Than your good words. But who comes here?

*Enter Harry Percy.*

**NORTH.**
==21==It is my son, young Harry Percy,
==22==Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
==23==Harry, how fares your uncle?

**PERCY.**
==24==I had thought, my lord, to have learn’d his health of you.

**NORTH.**
==25==Why, is he not with the Queen?

**PERCY.**
==26==No, my good lord, he hath forsook the court,
==27==Broken his staff of office, and dispers’d
==28==The household of the King.

**NORTH.**
==28==              What was his reason?
==29==He was not so resolv’d when last we spake together.

**PERCY.**
==30==Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
==31==But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh
==32==To offer service to the Duke of Herford,
==33==And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
==34==What power the Duke of York had levied there,
==35==Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.

**NORTH.**
==36==Have you forgot the Duke of Herford, boy?

**PERCY.**
==37==No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
==38==Which ne’er I did remember. To my knowledge,
==39==I never in my life did look on him.

**NORTH.**
==40==Then learn to know him now, this is the Duke.

**PERCY.**
==41==My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
==42==Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young,
==43==Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
==44==To more approved service and desert.

**BULL.**
==45==I thank thee, gentle Percy, and be sure
==46==I count myself in nothing else so happy
==47==As in a soul rememb’ring my good friends,
==48==And as my fortune ripens with thy love,
==49==It shall be still thy true love’s recompense.
==50==My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.

**NORTH.**
==51==How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir
==52==Keeps good old York there with his men of war?

**PERCY.**
==53==There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
==54==Mann’d with three hundred men, as I have heard,
==55==And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour,
==56==None else of name and noble estimate.

*Enter Ross and Willoughby.*

**NORTH.**
==57==Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
==58==Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.

**BULL.**
==59==Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
==60==A banish’d traitor. All my treasury
==61==Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich’d
==62==Shall be your love and labor’s recompense.

**ROSS.**
==63==Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.

**WILLO.**
==64==And far surmounts our labor to attain it.

**BULL.**
==65==Evermore thank’s the exchequer of the poor,
==66==Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
==67==Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?

**NORTH.**
==68==It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.

*Enter Berkeley.*

**BERK.**
==69==My Lord of Herford, my message is to you.

**BULL.**
==70==My lord, my answer is to Lancaster,
==71==And I am come to seek that name in England,
==72==And I must find that title in your tongue,
==73==Before I make reply to aught you say.

**BERK.**
==74==Mistake me not, my lord, ’tis not my meaning
==75==To rase one title of your honor out.
==76==To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
==77==From the most gracious regent of this land,
==78==The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
==79==To take advantage of the absent time,
==80==And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.

*Enter York attended.*

**BULL.**
==81==I shall not need transport my words by you,
==82==Here comes his Grace in person. My noble uncle!

*Kneels.*

**YORK.**
==83==Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
==84==Whose duty is deceivable and false.

**BULL.**
==85==My gracious uncle⁠—

**YORK.**
==86==Tut, tut!
==87==Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.
==88==I am no traitor’s uncle, and that word “grace”
==89==In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
==90==Why have those banish’d and forbidden legs
==91==Dar’d once to touch a dust of England’s ground?
==92==But then more “why?”—why have they dar’d to march
==93==So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
==94==Frighting her pale-fac’d villages with war
==95==And ostentation of despised arms?
==96==Com’st thou because the anointed King is hence?
==97==Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind,
==98==And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
==99==Were I but now lord of such hot youth
==100==As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
==101==Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
==102==From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
==103==O then how quickly should this arm of mine,
==104==Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee,
==105==And minister correction to thy fault!

**BULL.**
==106==My gracious uncle, let me know my fault,
==107==On what condition stands it and wherein?

**YORK.**
==108==Even in condition of the worst degree,
==109==In gross rebellion and detested treason.
==110==Thou art a banish’d man, and here art come,
==111==Before the expiration of thy time,
==112==In braving arms against thy sovereign.

**BULL.**
==113==As I was banish’d, I was banish’d Herford,
==114==But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
==115==And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace
==116==Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.
==117==You are my father, for methinks in you
==118==I see old Gaunt alive. O then, my father,
==119==Will you permit that I shall stand condemn’d
==120==A wandering vagabond, my rights and royalties
==121==Pluck’d from my arms perforce—and given away
==122==To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
==123==If that my cousin king be King in England,
==124==It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
==125==You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin,
==126==Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
==127==He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father
==128==To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
==129==I am denied to sue my livery here,
==130==And yet my letters-patents give me leave.
==131==My father’s goods are all distrain’d and sold,
==132==And these, and all, are all amiss employed.
==133==What would you have me do? I am a subject,
==134==And I challenge law. Attorneys are denied me,
==135==And therefore personally I lay my claim
==136==To my inheritance of free descent.

**NORTH.**
==137==The noble Duke hath been too much abused.

**ROSS.**
==138==It stands your Grace upon to do him right.

**WILLO.**
==139==Base men by his endowments are made great.

**YORK.**
==140==My lords of England, let me tell you this:
==141==I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs,
==142==And labor’d all I could to do him right;
==143==But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
==144==Be his own carver and cut out his way,
==145==To find out right with wrong—it may not be;
==146==And you that do abet him in this kind
==147==Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

**NORTH.**
==148==The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is
==149==But for his own; and for the right of that
==150==We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
==151==And let him never see joy that breaks that oath!

**YORK.**
==152==Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.
==153==I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
==154==Because my power is weak and all ill left;
==155==But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
==156==I would attach you all, and make you stoop
==157==Unto the sovereign mercy of the King;
==158==But since I cannot, be it known unto you
==159==I do remain as neuter. So fare you well,
==160==Unless you please to enter in the castle,
==161==And there repose you for this night.

**BULL.**
==162==An offer, uncle, that we will accept,
==163==But we must win your Grace to go with us
==164==To Bristow castle, which they say is held
==165==By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,
==166==The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
==167==Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

**YORK.**
==168==It may be I will go with you, but yet I’ll pause,
==169==For I am loath to break our country’s laws.
==170==Nor friends, nor foes, to me welcome you are:
==171==Things past redress are now with me past care.

*Exeunt.*
