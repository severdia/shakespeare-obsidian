## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Windsor Castle.*

*Enter the Queen, Bushy, Bagot.*

**BUSHY.**
==1==Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.
==2==You promis’d, when you parted with the King,
==3==To lay aside life-harming heaviness
==4==And entertain a cheerful disposition.

**QUEEN.**
==5==To please the King I did, to please myself
==6==I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
==7==Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
==8==Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
==9==As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks
==10==Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune’s womb,
==11==Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
==12==With nothing trembles; at some thing it grieves,
==13==More than with parting from my lord the King.

**BUSHY.**
==14==Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
==15==Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
==16==For sorrow’s eyes, glazed with blinding tears,
==17==Divides one thing entire to many objects,
==18==Like perspectives, which rightly gaz’d upon
==19==Show nothing but confusion; ey’d awry
==20==Distinguish form; so your sweet Majesty,
==21==Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,
==22==Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail,
==23==Which, look’d on as it is, is nought but shadows
==24==Of what it is not; then, thrice-gracious Queen,
==25==More than your lord’s departure weep not—more is not seen,
==26==Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,
==27==Which for things true weeps things imaginary.

**QUEEN.**
==28==It may be so; but yet my inward soul
==29==Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe’er it be,
==30==I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad,
==31==As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
==32==Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.

**BUSHY.**
==33==’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.

**QUEEN.**
==34==’Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv’d
==35==From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
==36==For nothing hath begot my something grief,
==37==Or something hath the nothing that I grieve⁠—
==38==’Tis in reversion that I do possess⁠—
==39==But what it is that is not yet known what,
==40==I cannot name; ’tis nameless woe, I wot.

*Enter Green.*

**GREEN.**
==41==God save your Majesty! And well met, gentlemen.
==42==I hope the King is not yet shipp’d for Ireland.

**QUEEN.**
==43==Why hopest thou so? ’Tis better hope he is,
==44==For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.
==45==Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp’d?

**GREEN.**
==46==That he, our hope, might have retir’d his power,
==47==And driven into despair an enemy’s hope,
==48==Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
==49==The banish’d Bullingbrook repeals himself,
==50==And with uplifted arms is safe arriv’d
==51==At Ravenspurgh.

**QUEEN.**
==51==        Now God in heaven forbid!

**GREEN.**
==52==Ah, madam! ’Tis too true, and that is worse,
==53==The Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry Percy,
==54==The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
==55==With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.

**BUSHY.**
==56==Why have you not proclaim’d Northumberland
==57==And all the rest revolted faction traitors?

**GREEN.**
==58==We have, whereupon the Earl of Worcester
==59==Hath broken his staff, resign’d his stewardship,
==60==And all the household servants fled with him
==61==To Bullingbrook.

**QUEEN.**
==62==So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
==63==And Bullingbrook my sorrow’s dismal heir.
==64==Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
==65==And I, a gasping new-deliver’d mother,
==66==Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join’d.

**BUSHY.**
==67==Despair not, madam.

**QUEEN.**
==67==           Who shall hinder me?
==68==I will despair, and be at enmity
==69==With cozening hope. He is a flatterer,
==70==A parasite, a keeper-back of death,
==71==Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
==72==Which false hope lingers in extremity.

*Enter York.*

**GREEN.**
==73==Here comes the Duke of York.

**QUEEN.**
==74==With signs of war about his aged neck.
==75==O, full of careful business are his looks!
==76==Uncle, for God’s sake speak comfortable words.

**YORK.**
==77==Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.
==78==Comfort’s in heaven, and we are on the earth,
==79==Where nothing lives but crosses, cares, and grief.
==80==Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
==81==Whilst others come to make him lose at home.
==82==Here am I left to underprop his land,
==83==Who, weak with age, cannot support myself.
==84==Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made,
==85==Now shall he try his friends that flatter’d him.

*Enter a Servingman.*

**SERV.**
==86==My lord, your son was gone before I came.

**YORK.**
==87==He was—why, so go all which way it will!
==88==The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
==89==And will, I fear, revolt on Herford’s side.
==90==Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester,
==91==Bid her send me presently a thousand pound.
==92==Hold, take my ring.

**SERV.**
==93==My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship:
==94==Today, as I came by, I called there⁠—
==95==But I shall grieve you to report the rest.

**YORK.**
==96==What is’t, knave?

**SERV.**
==97==An hour before I came, the Duchess died.

**YORK.**
==98==God for his mercy, what a tide of woes
==99==Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
==100==I know not what to do. I would to God
==101==(So my untruth had not provok’d him to it) 
==102==The King had cut off my head with my brother’s.
==103==What, are there no posts disparch’d for Ireland?
==104==How shall we do for money for these wars?
==105==Come, sister—cousin, I would say—pray pardon me.
==106==Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts,
==107==And bring away the armor that is there.
*(Exit Servingman.)*
==108==Gentlemen, will you go muster men? If I
==109==Know how or which way to order these affairs
==110==Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,
==111==Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
==112==T’ one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
==113==And duty bids defend; t’ other again
==114==Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong’d,
==115==Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
==116==Well, somewhat we must do.
==117==Come, cousin, I’ll dispose of you.
==118==Gentlemen, go muster up your men,
==119==And meet me presently at Berkeley.
==120==I should to Plashy too,
==121==But time will not permit. All is uneven,
==122==And every thing is left at six and seven.

*Exeunt Duke of York, Queen. Manent Bushy, Green, Bagot.*

**BUSHY.**
==123==The wind sits fair for news to go for Ireland,
==124==But none returns. For us to levy power
==125==Proportionable to the enemy
==126==Is all unpossible.

**GREEN.**
==127==Besides, our nearness to the King in love
==128==Is near the hate of those love not the King.

**BAGOT.**
==129==And that is the wavering commons, for their love
==130==Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
==131==By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.

**BUSHY.**
==132==Wherein the King stands generally condemn’d.

**BAGOT.**
==133==If judgment lie in them, then so do we,
==134==Because we ever have been near the King.

**GREEN.**
==135==Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow castle:
==136==The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.

**BUSHY.**
==137==Thither will I with you, for little office
==138==Will the hateful commons perform for us,
==139==Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
==140==Will you go along with us?

**BAGOT.**
==141==No, I will to Ireland to his Majesty.
==142==Farewell! If heart’s presages be not vain,
==143==We three here part that ne’er shall meet again.

**BUSHY.**
==144==That’s as York thrives to beat back Bullingbrook.

**GREEN.**
==145==Alas, poor duke, the task he undertakes
==146==Is numb’ring sands and drinking oceans dry;
==147==Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
==148==Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.

**BUSHY.**
==149==Well, we may meet again.

**BAGOT.**
==149==              I fear me, never.

*Exeunt.*
