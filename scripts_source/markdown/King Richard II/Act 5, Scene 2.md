## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The Duke of York’s palace.*

*Enter Duke of York and the Duchess of York.*

**DUCH. YORK.**
==1==My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
==2==When weeping made you break the story off,
==3==Of our two cousins coming into London.

**YORK.**
==4==Where did I leave?

**DUCH. YORK.**
==4==           At that sad stop, my lord,
==5==Where rude misgoverned hands from windows’ tops
==6==Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard’s head.

**YORK.**
==7==Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bullingbrook,
==8==Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,
==9==Which his aspiring rider seem’d to know,
==10==With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
==11==Whilst all tongues cried, “God save thee, Bullingbrook!”
==12==You would have thought the very windows spake,
==13==So many greedy looks of young and old
==14==Through casements darted their desiring eyes
==15==Upon his visage, and that all the walls
==16==With painted imagery had said at once,
==17==“Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bullingbrook!”
==18==Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
==19==Bare-headed, lower than his proud steed’s neck,
==20==Bespake them thus: “I thank you, countrymen.”
==21==And thus still doing, thus he pass’d along.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==22==Alack, poor Richard, where rode he the whilst?

**YORK.**
==23==As in a theatre the eyes of men,
==24==After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
==25==Are idly bent on him that enters next,
==26==Thinking his prattle to be tedious,
==27==Even so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyes
==28==Did scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried “God save him!”
==29==No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,
==30==But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,
==31==Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
==32==His face still combating with tears and smiles,
==33==The badges of his grief and patience,
==34==That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel’d
==35==The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,
==36==And barbarism itself have pitied him.
==37==But heaven hath a hand in these events,
==38==To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
==39==To Bullingbrook are we sworn subjects now,
==40==Whose state and honor I for aye allow.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==41==Here comes my son Aumerle.

*Enter Aumerle.*

**YORK.**
==41==                Aumerle that was,
==42==But that is lost for being Richard’s friend;
==43==And, madam, you must call him Rutland now.
==44==I am in parliament pledge for his truth
==45==And lasting fealty to the new-made king.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==46==Welcome, my son! Who are the violets now
==47==That strew the green lap of the new-come spring?

**AUM.**
==48==Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not,
==49==God knows I had as lief be none as one.

**YORK.**
==50==Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
==51==Lest you be cropp’d before you come to prime.
==52==What news from Oxford? Do these justs and triumphs hold?

**AUM.**
==53==For aught I know, my lord, they do.

**YORK.**
==54==You will be there, I know.

**AUM.**
==55==If God prevent not, I purpose so.

**YORK.**
==56==What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
==57==Yea, look’st thou pale? Let me see the writing.

**AUM.**
==58==My lord, ’tis nothing.

**YORK.**
==58==           No matter then who see it.
==59==I will be satisfied, let me see the writing.

**AUM.**
==60==I do beseech your Grace to pardon me.
==61==It is a matter of small consequence,
==62==Which for some reasons I would not have seen.

**YORK.**
==63==Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
==64==I fear, I fear⁠—

**DUCH. YORK.**
==64==        What should you fear?
==65==’Tis nothing but some band that he is ent’red into
==66==For gay apparel ’gainst the triumph day.

**YORK.**
==67==Bound to himself! What doth he with a bond
==68==That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
==69==Boy, let me see the writing.

**AUM.**
==70==I do beseech you pardon me, I may not show it.

**YORK.**
==71==I will be satisfied, let me see it, I say.
*(He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it.)*
==72==Treason, foul treason! Villain, traitor, slave!

**DUCH. YORK.**
==73==What is the matter, my lord?

**YORK.**
==74==Ho, who is within there?
*(Enter a Servant.)*
==74==              Saddle my horse.
==75==God for his mercy! What treachery is here!

**DUCH. YORK.**
==76==Why, what is it, my lord?

**YORK.**
==77==Give me my boots, I say, saddle my horse.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==78==Now by mine honor, by my life, by my troth,
==79==I will appeach the villain.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==79==              What is the matter?

**YORK.**
==80==Peace, foolish woman.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==81==I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle?

**AUM.**
==82==Good mother, be content, it is no more
==83==Than my poor life must answer.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==83==                  Thy life answer?

**YORK.**
==84==Bring me my boots, I will unto the King.

*His Man enters with his boots.*

**DUCH. YORK.**
==85==Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amaz’d.
==86==Hence, villain! Never more come in my sight.

**YORK.**
==87==Give me my boots, I say.

*His Man helps him on with his boots and exit.*

**DUCH. YORK.**
==88==Why, York, what wilt thou do?
==89==Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
==90==Have we more sons? Or are we like to have?
==91==Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
==92==And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
==93==And rob me of a happy mother’s name?
==94==Is he not like thee? Is he not thine own?

**YORK.**
==95==Thou fond mad woman,
==96==Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
==97==A dozen of them here have ta’en the sacrament,
==98==And interchangeably set down their hands,
==99==To kill the King at Oxford.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==99==              He shall be none,
==100==We’ll keep him here, then what is that to him?

**YORK.**
==101==Away, fond woman, were he twenty times my son,
==102==I would appeach him.

**DUCH. YORK.**
==102==           Hadst thou groan’d for him
==103==As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
==104==But now I know thy mind, thou dost suspect
==105==That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
==106==And that he is a bastard, not thy son.
==107==Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind,
==108==He is as like thee as a man may be,
==109==Not like to me, or any of my kin,
==110==And yet I love him.

**YORK.**
==110==           Make way, unruly woman!

*Exit.*

**DUCH. YORK.**
==111==After, Aumerle! Mount thee upon his horse,
==112==Spur post, and get before him to the King,
==113==And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
==114==I’ll not be long behind; though I be old,
==115==I doubt not but to ride as fast as York.
==116==An’ never will I rise up from the ground
==117==Till Bullingbrook have pardoned thee. Away, be gone!

*Exeunt.*
