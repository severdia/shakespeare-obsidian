## Act 5, Scene 6
[[Act 5, Scene 5|← Act 5, Scene 5]]

*Windsor Castle.*

*Flourish. Enter Bullingbrook, now King Henry, with the Duke of York with other Lords and Attendants.*

**K. HEN.**
==1==Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
==2==Is that the rebels have consum’d with fire
==3==Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire,
==4==But whether they be ta’en or slain we hear not.
*(Enter Northumberland.)*
==5==Welcome, my lord, what is the news?

**NORTH.**
==6==First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
==7==The next news is, I have to London sent
==8==The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent.
==9==The manner of their taking may appear
==10==At large discoursed in this paper here.

**K. HEN.**
==11==We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains,
==12==And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.

*Enter Lord Fitzwater.*

**FITZ.**
==13==My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
==14==The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
==15==Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
==16==That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.

**K. HEN.**
==17==Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot,
==18==Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.

*Enter Harry Percy and the Bishop of Carlisle.*

**PERCY.**
==19==The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
==20==With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
==21==Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
==22==But here is Carlisle living, to abide
==23==Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.

**K. HEN.**
==24==Carlisle, this is your doom:
==25==Choose out some secret place, some reverent room,
==26==More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life.
==27==So as thou liv’st in peace, die free from strife,
==28==For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
==29==High sparks of honor in thee have I seen.

*Enter Exton with Attendants bearing the coffin.*

**EXTON.**
==30==Great King, within this coffin I present
==31==Thy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies
==32==The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
==33==Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.

**K. HEN.**
==34==Exton, I thank thee not, for thou hast wrought
==35==A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
==36==Upon my head and all this famous land.

**EXTON.**
==37==From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.

**K. HEN.**
==38==They love not poison that do poison need,
==39==Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead,
==40==I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
==41==The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labor,
==42==But neither my good word nor princely favor.
==43==With Cain go wander thorough shades of night,
==44==And never show thy head by day nor light.
==45==Lords, I protest my soul is full of woe
==46==That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.
==47==Come mourn with me for what I do lament,
==48==And put on sullen black incontinent.
==49==I’ll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
==50==To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.
==51==March sadly after, grace my mournings here,
==52==In weeping after this untimely bier.

*Exeunt.*
