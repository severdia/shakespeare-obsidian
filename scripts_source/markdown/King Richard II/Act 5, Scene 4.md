## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*A royal palace.*

*Enter Sir Pierce Exton and his Servants.*

**EXTON.**
Didst thou not mark the King, what words he spake?
“Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?”
Was it not so?

**1. EXT. SERV.**
        These were his very words.

**EXTON.**
“Have I no friend?” quoth he. He spake it twice,
And urg’d it twice together, did he not?

**2. EXT. SERV.**
He did.

**EXTON.**
And speaking it, he wishtly look’d on me
As who should say, “I would thou wert the man
That would divorce this terror from my heart”⁠—
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come let’s go.
I am the King’s friend, and will rid his foe.

*Exeunt.*
