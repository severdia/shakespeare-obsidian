## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 6|Act 5, Scene 6 →]]

*The dungeon of Pomfret Castle.*

*Enter Richard alone.*

**K. RICH.**
==1==I have been studying how I may compare
==2==This prison where I live unto the world;
==3==And for because the world is populous,
==4==And here is not a creature but myself,
==5==I cannot do it; yet I’ll hammer it out.
==6==My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,
==7==My soul the father, and these two beget
==8==A generation of still-breeding thoughts;
==9==And these some thoughts people this little world,
==10==In humors like the people of this world:
==11==For no thought is contented. The better sort,
==12==As thoughts of things divine, are intermix’d
==13==With scruples and do set the word itself
==14==Against the word,
==15==As thus: “Come, little ones,” and then again,
==16==“It is as hard to come as for a camel
==17==To thread the postern of a small needle’s eye.”
==18==Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
==19==Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
==20==May tear a passage thorough the flinty ribs
==21==Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
==22==And for they cannot, die in their own pride.
==23==Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
==24==That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,
==25==Nor shall not be the last—like seely beggars
==26==Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
==27==That many have and others must sit there;
==28==And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
==29==Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
==30==Of such as have before endur’d the like.
==31==Thus play I in one person many people,
==32==And none contented. Sometimes am I king;
==33==Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
==34==And so I am. Then crushing penury
==35==Persuades me I was better when a king;
==36==Then am I king’d again, and by and by
==37==Think that I am unking’d by Bullingbrook,
==38==And straight am nothing. But what e’er I be,
==39==Nor I, nor any man that but man is,
==40==With nothing shall be pleas’d, till he be eas’d
==41==With being nothing.
*(The music plays.)*
==41==              Music do I hear?
==42==Ha, ha, keep time! How sour sweet music is
==43==When time is broke, and no proportion kept!
==44==So is it in the music of men’s lives.
==45==And here have I the daintiness of ear
==46==To check time broke in a disordered string;
==47==But for the concord of my state and time
==48==Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
==49==I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
==50==For now hath time made me his numb’ring clock:
==51==My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar
==52==Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
==53==Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,
==54==Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
==55==Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
==56==Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
==57==Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans
==58==Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
==59==Runs posting on in Bullingbrook’s proud joy,
==60==While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.
==61==This music mads me, let it sound no more,
==62==For though it have help mad men to their wits,
==63==In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
==64==Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
==65==For ’tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
==66==Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.

*Enter a Groom of the Stable.*

**GROOM.**
==67==Hail, royal prince!

**K. RICH.**
==67==           Thanks, noble peer!
==68==The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
==69==What art thou? And how comest thou hither,
==70==Where no man never comes, but that sad dog
==71==That brings me food to make misfortune live?

**GROOM.**
==72==I was a poor groom of thy stable, King,
==73==When thou wert king; who, traveling towards York,
==74==With much ado (at length) have gotten leave
==75==To look upon my sometimes royal master’s face.
==76==O how it ern’d my heart when I beheld
==77==In London streets, that coronation-day,
==78==When Bullingbrook rode on roan Barbary,
==79==That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
==80==That horse that I so carefully have dress’d!

**K. RICH.**
==81==Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
==82==How went he under him?

**GROOM.**
==83==So proudly as if he disdain’d the ground.

**K. RICH.**
==84==So proud that Bullingbrook was on his back!
==85==That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand,
==86==This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
==87==Would he not stumble? Would he not fall down,
==88==Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
==89==Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
==90==Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,
==91==Since thou, created to be aw’d by man,
==92==Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse,
==93==And yet I bear a burden like an ass,
==94==Spurr’d, gall’d, and tir’d by jauncing Bullingbrook.

*Enter the Keeper to Richard with meat.*

**KEEP.**
==95==Fellow, give place, here is no longer stay.

**K. RICH.**
==96==If thou love me, ’tis time thou wert away.

**GROOM.**
==97==What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.

*Exit Groom.*

**KEEP.**
==98==My lord, will’t please you to fall to?

**K. RICH.**
==99==Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.

**KEEP.**
==100==My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton, who
==101==Lately came from the King, commands the contrary.

**K. RICH.**
==102==The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
==103==Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.

*Beats the Keeper.*

**KEEP.**
==104==Help, help, help!

*The murderers, Exton and Servants, rush in armed.*

**K. RICH.**
==105==How now, what means death in this rude assault?
==106==Villain, thy own hand yields thy death’s instrument,
*(Snatches an axe from a Servant and kills him.)*
==107==Go thou and fill another room in hell.
*(Kills another. Here Exton strikes him down.)*
==108==That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
==109==That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
==110==Hath with the King’s blood stain’d the King’s own land.
==111==Mount, mount, my soul! Thy seat is up on high,
==112==Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.

*Dies.*

**EXTON.**
==113==As full of valor as of royal blood!
==114==Both have I spill’d; O would the deed were good!
==115==For now the devil that told me I did well
==116==Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
==117==This dead king to the living king I’ll bear;
==118==Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.

*Exeunt.*
