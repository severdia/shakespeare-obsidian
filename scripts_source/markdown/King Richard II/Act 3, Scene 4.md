## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Langley. The Duke of York’s garden.*

*Enter the Queen with two Ladies, her attendants.*

**QUEEN.**
==1==What sport shall we devise here in this garden
==2==To drive away the heavy thought of care?

**1. LADY**
==3==Madam, we’ll play at bowls.

**QUEEN.**
==4==’Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
==5==And that my fortune runs against the bias.

**2. LADY**
==6==Madam, we’ll dance.

**QUEEN.**
==7==My legs can keep no measure in delight,
==8==When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief;
==9==Therefore no dancing, girl, some other sport.

**1. LADY**
==10==Madam, we’ll tell tales.

**QUEEN.**
==11==Of sorrow or of joy?

**1. LADY**
==11==           Of either, madam.

**QUEEN.**
==12==Of neither, girl;
==13==For if of joy, being altogether wanting,
==14==It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
==15==Or if of grief, being altogether had,
==16==It adds more sorrow to my want of joy;
==17==For what I have I need not to repeat,
==18==And what I want it boots not to complain.

**2. LADY**
==19==Madam, I’ll sing.

**QUEEN.**
==19==        ’Tis well that thou hast cause,
==20==But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.

**1. LADY**
==21==I could weep, madam, would it do you good.

**QUEEN.**
==22==And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
==23==And never borrow any tear of thee.
*(Enter a Gardener and two of his Men.)*
==24==But stay, here come the gardeners.
==25==Let’s step into the shadow of these trees.
==26==My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
==27==They will talk of state, for every one doth so
==28==Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.

*Queen and Ladies retire.*

**GARD.**
==29==Go bind thou up young dangling apricots,
==30==Which like unruly children make their sire
==31==Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight;
==32==Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
==33==Go thou, and like an executioner
==34==Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
==35==That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
==36==All must be even in our government.
==37==You thus employed, I will go root away
==38==The noisome weeds which without profit suck
==39==The soil’s fertility from wholesome flowers.

**1. GARD. MAN.**
==40==Why should we in the compass of a pale
==41==Keep law and form and due proportion,
==42==Showing as in a model our firm estate,
==43==When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
==44==Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers chok’d up,
==45==Her fruit-trees all unprun’d, her hedges ruin’d,
==46==Her knots disordered, and her wholesome herbs
==47==Swarming with caterpillars?

**GARD.**
==47==                Hold thy peace.
==48==He that hath suffered this disordered spring
==49==Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf.
==50==The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
==51==That seem’d in eating him to hold him up,
==52==Are pluck’d up root and all by Bullingbrook,
==53==I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.

**2. GARD. MAN.**
==54==What, are they dead?

**GARD.**
==54==           They are; and Bullingbrook
==55==Hath seiz’d the wasteful King. O, what pity is it
==56==That he had not so trimm’d and dress’d his land
==57==As we this garden! We at time of year
==58==Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
==59==Lest being over-proud in sap and blood,
==60==With too much riches it confound itself;
==61==Had he done so to great and growing men,
==62==They might have liv’d to bear and he to taste
==63==Their fruits of duty. Superfluous branches
==64==We lop away, that bearing boughs may live;
==65==Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
==66==Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.

**2. GARD. MAN.**
==67==What, think you the King shall be deposed?

**GARD.**
==68==Depress’d he is already, and depos’d
==69==’Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night
==70==To a dear friend of the good Duke of York’s
==71==That tell black tidings.

**QUEEN.**
==72==O, I am press’d to death through want of speaking!
*(Coming forward.)*
==73==Thou old Adam’s likeness, set to dress this garden,
==74==How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
==75==What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
==76==To make a second fall of cursed man?
==77==Why dost thou say King Richard is depos’d?
==78==Dar’st thou, thou little better thing than earth,
==79==Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
==80==Cam’st thou by this ill tidings? Speak, thou wretch.

**GARD.**
==81==Pardon me, madam, little joy have I
==82==To breathe this news, yet what I say is true:
==83==King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
==84==Of Bullingbrook; their fortunes both are weigh’d.
==85==In your lord’s scale is nothing but himself,
==86==And some few vanities that make him light;
==87==But in the balance of great Bullingbrook,
==88==Besides himself, are all the English peers,
==89==And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
==90==Post you to London and you will find it so,
==91==I speak no more than every one doth know.

**QUEEN.**
==92==Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
==93==Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
==94==And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest
==95==To serve me last that I may longest keep
==96==Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go
==97==To meet at London London’s king in woe.
==98==What, was I born to this, that my sad look
==99==Should grace the triumph of great Bullingbrook?
==100==Gard’ner, for telling me these news of woe,
==101==Pray God the plants thou graft’st may never grow.

*Exit with Ladies.*

**GARD.**
==102==Poor queen, so that thy state might be no worse,
==103==I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
==104==Here did she fall a tear, here in this place
==105==I’ll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace.
==106==Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
==107==In the remembrance of a weeping queen.

*Exeunt.*
