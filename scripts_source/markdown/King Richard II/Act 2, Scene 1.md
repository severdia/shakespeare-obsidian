## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Ely House.*

*Enter John of Gaunt, sick, with the Duke of York, etc.*

**GAUNT.**
==1==Will the King come, that I may breathe my last
==2==In wholesome counsel to his unstayed youth?

**YORK.**
==3==Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath,
==4==For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.

**GAUNT.**
==5==O but they say the tongues of dying men
==6==Enforce attention like deep harmony.
==7==Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
==8==For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
==9==He that no more must say is listened more
==10==Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose.
==11==More are men’s ends mark’d than their lives before.
==12==The setting sun, and music at the close,
==13==As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
==14==Writ in remembrance more than things long past.
==15==Though Richard my live’s counsel would not hear,
==16==My death’s sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

**YORK.**
==17==No, it is stopp’d with other flattering sounds,
==18==As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
==19==Lascivious meters, to whose venom sound
==20==The open ear of youth doth always listen;
==21==Report of fashions in proud Italy,
==22==Whose manners still our tardy, apish nation
==23==Limps after in base imitation.
==24==Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity⁠—
==25==So it be new, there’s no respect how vile⁠—
==26==That is not quickly buzz’d into his ears?
==27==Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
==28==Where will doth mutiny with wit’s regard.
==29==Direct not him whose way himself will choose,
==30==’Tis breath thou lack’st, and that breath wilt thou lose.

**GAUNT.**
==31==Methinks I am a prophet new inspir’d,
==32==And thus expiring do foretell of him:
==33==His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
==34==For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
==35==Small show’rs last long, but sudden storms are short;
==36==He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
==37==With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder;
==38==Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
==39==Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
==40==This royal throne of kings, this scepterd isle,
==41==This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
==42==This other Eden, demi-paradise,
==43==This fortress built by Nature for herself
==44==Against infection and the hand of war,
==45==This happy breed of men, this little world,
==46==This precious stone set in the silver sea,
==47==Which serves it in the office of a wall,
==48==Or as a moat defensive to a house,
==49==Against the envy of less happier lands;
==50==This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
==51==This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
==52==Fear’d by their breed, and famous by their birth,
==53==Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
==54==For Christian service and true chivalry,
==55==As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
==56==Of the world’s ransom, blessed Mary’s Son;
==57==This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
==58==Dear for her reputation through the world,
==59==Is now leas’d out—I die pronouncing it⁠—
==60==Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
==61==England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
==62==Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
==63==Of wat’ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
==64==With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;
==65==That England, that was wont to conquer others,
==66==Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
==67==Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
==68==How happy then were my ensuing death!

*Enter King and Queen, etc.—Aumerle, Bushy, Green, Bagot, Ross, and Willoughby.*

**YORK.**
==69==The King is come. Deal mildly with his youth,
==70==For young hot colts being rag’d do rage the more.

**QUEEN.**
==71==How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?

**K. RICH.**
==72==What comfort, man? How is’t with aged Gaunt?

**GAUNT.**
==73==O how that name befits my composition!
==74==Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old.
==75==Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
==76==And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
==77==For sleeping England long time have I watch’d,
==78==Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt.
==79==The pleasure that some fathers feed upon
==80==Is my strict fast—I mean, my children’s looks;
==81==And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.
==82==Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
==83==Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.

**K. RICH.**
==84==Can sick men play so nicely with their names?

**GAUNT.**
==85==No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
==86==Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
==87==I mock my name, great King, to flatter thee.

**K. RICH.**
==88==Should dying men flatter with those that live?

**GAUNT.**
==89==No, no, men living flatter those that die.

**K. RICH.**
==90==Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.

**GAUNT.**
==91==O no, thou diest, though I the sicker be.

**K. RICH.**
==92==I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.

**GAUNT.**
==93==Now He that made me knows I see thee ill,
==94==Ill in myself to see, and in thee, seeing ill.
==95==Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land,
==96==Wherein thou liest in reputation sick,
==97==And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
==98==Commit’st thy anointed body to the cure
==99==Of those physicians that first wounded thee.
==100==A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
==101==Whose compass is no bigger than thy head,
==102==And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
==103==The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
==104==O had thy grandsire with a prophet’s eye
==105==Seen how his son’s son should destroy his sons,
==106==From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
==107==Deposing thee before thou wert possess’d,
==108==Which art possess’d now to depose thyself.
==109==Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
==110==It were a shame to let this land by lease;
==111==But for thy world enjoying but this land,
==112==Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
==113==Landlord of England art thou now, not king,
==114==Thy state of law is bond-slave to the law,
==115==And thou⁠—

**K. RICH.**
==115==        A lunatic lean-witted fool,
==116==Presuming on an ague’s privilege,
==117==Darest with thy frozen admonition
==118==Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
==119==With fury from his native residence.
==120==Now by my seat’s right royal majesty,
==121==Wert thou not brother to great Edward’s son,
==122==This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
==123==Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.

**GAUNT.**
==124==O, spare me not, my brother Edward’s son,
==125==For that I was his father Edward’s son,
==126==That blood already, like the pelican,
==127==Hast thou tapp’d out and drunkenly carous’d.
==128==My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
==129==Whom fair befall in heaven ’mongst happy souls,
==130==May be a president and witness good
==131==That thou respect’st not spilling Edward’s blood.
==132==Join with the present sickness that I have,
==133==And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
==134==To crop at once a too long withered flower.
==135==Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
==136==These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
==137==Convey me to my bed, then to my grave;
==138==Love they to live that love and honor have.

*Exit, borne off by his Attendants.*

**K. RICH.**
==139==And let them die that age and sullens have,
==140==For both hast thou, and both become the grave.

**YORK.**
==141==I do beseech your Majesty, impute his words
==142==To wayward sickliness and age in him.
==143==He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
==144==As Harry Duke of Herford, were he here.

**K. RICH.**
==145==Right, you say true: as Herford’s love, so his,
==146==As theirs, so mine, and all be as it is.

*Enter Northumberland.*

**NORTH.**
==147==My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty.

**K. RICH.**
==148==What says he?

**NORTH.**
==148==        Nay, nothing, all is said.
==149==His tongue is now a stringless instrument,
==150==Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.

**YORK.**
==151==Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
==152==Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

**K. RICH.**
==153==The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
==154==His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
==155==So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
==156==We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
==157==Which live like venom where no venom else
==158==But only they have privilege to live.
==159==And, for these great affairs do ask some charge,
==160==Towards our assistance we do seize to us
==161==The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables
==162==Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess’d.

**YORK.**
==163==How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long
==164==Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
==165==Not Gloucester’s death, nor Herford’s banishment,
==166==Not Gaunt’s rebukes, nor England’s private wrongs,
==167==Nor the prevention of poor Bullingbrook
==168==About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
==169==Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
==170==Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign’s face.
==171==I am the last of noble Edward’s sons,
==172==Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.
==173==In war was never lion rag’d more fierce,
==174==In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
==175==Than was that young and princely gentleman.
==176==His face thou hast, for even so look’d he,
==177==Accomplish’d with the number of thy hours;
==178==But when he frowned it was against the French,
==179==And not against his friends. His noble hand
==180==Did win what he did spend, and spent not that
==181==Which his triumphant father’s hand had won.
==182==His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
==183==But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
==184==O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
==185==Or else he never would compare between.

**K. RICH.**
==186==Why, uncle, what’s the matter?

**YORK.**
==186==                  O my liege,
==187==Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleas’d
==188==Not to be pardoned, am content withal.
==189==Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
==190==The royalties and rights of banish’d Herford?
==191==Is not Gaunt dead? And doth not Herford live?
==192==Was not Gaunt just? And is not Harry true?
==193==Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
==194==Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
==195==Take Herford’s rights away, and take from Time
==196==His charters and his customary rights;
==197==Let not tomorrow then ensue today;
==198==Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
==199==But by fair sequence and succession?
==200==Now afore God—God forbid I say true!⁠—
==201==If you do wrongfully seize Herford’s rights,
==202==Call in the letters-patents that he hath
==203==By his attorneys-general to sue
==204==His livery, and deny his off’red homage,
==205==You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
==206==You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts,
==207==And prick my tender patience to those thoughts
==208==Which honor and allegiance cannot think.

**K. RICH.**
==209==Think what you will, we seize into our hands
==210==His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.

**YORK.**
==211==I’ll not be by the while. My liege, farewell!
==212==What will ensue hereof, there’s none can tell;
==213==But by bad courses may be understood
==214==That their events can never fall out good.

*Exit.*

**K. RICH.**
==215==Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight,
==216==Bid him repair to us to Ely House
==217==To see this business. Tomorrow next
==218==We will for Ireland, and ’tis time, I trow.
==219==And we create, in absence of ourself,
==220==Our uncle York lord governor of England;
==221==For he is just and always loved us well.
==222==Come on, our queen, tomorrow must we part.
==223==Be merry, for our time of stay is short.

*Flourish. Exeunt King and Queen with others. Manet Northumberland with Willoughby and Ross.*

**NORTH.**
==224==Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.

**ROSS.**
==225==And living too, for now his son is Duke.

**WILLO.**
==226==Barely in title, not in revenues.

**NORTH.**
==227==Richly in both, if justice had her right.

**ROSS.**
==228==My heart is great, but it must break with silence,
==229==Ere’t be disburdened with a liberal tongue.

**NORTH.**
==230==Nay, speak thy mind, and let him ne’er speak more
==231==That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!

**WILLO.**
==232==Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Herford?
==233==If it be so, out with it boldly, man,
==234==Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.

**ROSS.**
==235==No good at all that I can do for him,
==236==Unless you call it good to pity him,
==237==Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.

**NORTH.**
==238==Now, afore God, ’tis shame such wrongs are borne
==239==In him, a royal prince, and many more
==240==Of noble blood in this declining land.
==241==The King is not himself, but basely led
==242==By flatterers, and what they will inform,
==243==Merely in hate, ’gainst any of us all,
==244==That will the King severely prosecute
==245==’Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.

**ROSS.**
==246==The commons hath he pill’d with grievous taxes,
==247==And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he fin’d
==248==For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.

**WILLO.**
==249==And daily new exactions are devis’d,
==250==As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what.
==251==But what a’ God’s name doth become of this?

**NORTH.**
==252==Wars hath not wasted it, for warr’d he hath not,
==253==But basely yielded upon compromise
==254==That which his noble ancestors achiev’d with blows.
==255==More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.

**ROSS.**
==256==The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

**WILLO.**
==257==The King’s grown bankrupt, like a broken man.

**NORTH.**
==258==Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.

**ROSS.**
==259==He hath not money for these Irish wars,
==260==His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,
==261==But by the robbing of the banish’d Duke.

**NORTH.**
==262==His noble kinsman—most degenerate king!
==263==But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
==264==Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm;
==265==We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
==266==And yet we strike not, but securely perish.

**ROSS.**
==267==We see the very wrack that we must suffer,
==268==And unavoided is the danger now,
==269==For suffering so the causes of our wrack.

**NORTH.**
==270==Not so, even through the hollow eyes of death
==271==I spy life peering, but I dare not say
==272==How near the tidings of our comfort is.

**WILLO.**
==273==Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.

**ROSS.**
==274==Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
==275==We three are but thyself, and, speaking so,
==276==Thy words are but as thoughts, therefore be bold.

**NORTH.**
==277==Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc,
==278==A bay in Britain, receiv’d intelligence
==279==That Harry Duke of Herford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
==280==Thomas, son and heir to th’ Earl of Arundel,
==281==That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
==282==His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
==283==Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
==284==Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Coint⁠—
==285==All these, well furnished by the Duke of Britain
==286==With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
==287==Are making hither with all due expedience,
==288==And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.
==289==Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
==290==The first departing of the King for Ireland.
==291==If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
==292==Imp out our drooping country’s broken wing,
==293==Redeem from broking pawn the blemish’d crown,
==294==Wipe off the dust that hides our scepter’s gilt,
==295==And make high majesty look like itself,
==296==Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
==297==But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
==298==Stay, and be secret, and myself will go.

**ROSS.**
==299==To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.

**WILLO.**
==300==Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.

*Exeunt.*
