## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*London. The temple garden.*

*Enter Richard Plantagenet, Warwick, Somerset, Pole the Earl of Suffolk, and others; Vernon and a Lawyer.*

**PLAN.**
==1==Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?
==2==Dare no man answer in a case of truth?

**SUF.**
==3==Within the Temple Hall we were too loud,
==4==The garden here is more convenient.

**PLAN.**
==5==Then say at once if I maintain’d the truth;
==6==Or else was wrangling Somerset in th’ error?

**SUF.**
==7==Faith, I have been a truant in the law,
==8==And never yet could frame my will to it,
==9==And therefore frame the law unto my will.

**SOM.**
==10==Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then between us.

**WAR.**
==11==Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch,
==12==Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth,
==13==Between two blades, which bears the better temper,
==14==Between two horses, which doth bear him best,
==15==Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye⁠—
==16==I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment;
==17==But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
==18==Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.

**PLAN.**
==19==Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance.
==20==The truth appears so naked on my side
==21==That any purblind eye may find it out.

**SOM.**
==22==And on my side it is so well apparell’d,
==23==So clear, so shining, and so evident,
==24==That it will glimmer through a blindman’s eye.

**PLAN.**
==25==Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
==26==In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
==27==Let him that is a true-born gentleman
==28==And stands upon the honor of his birth,
==29==If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
==30==From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.

**SOM.**
==31==Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
==32==But dare maintain the party of the truth,
==33==Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.

**WAR.**
==34==I love no colors; and without all color
==35==Of base insinuating flattery,
==36==I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.

**SUF.**
==37==I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,
==38==And say withal, I think he held the right.

**VER.**
==39==Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,
==40==Till you conclude that he upon whose side
==41==The fewest roses are cropp’d from the tree
==42==Shall yield the other in the right opinion.

**SOM.**
==43==Good Master Vernon, it is well objected;
==44==If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.

**PLAN.**
==45==And I.

**VER.**
==46==Then for the truth and plainness of the case,
==47==I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
==48==Giving my verdict on the white rose side.

**SOM.**
==49==Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
==50==Lest, bleeding, you do paint the white rose red,
==51==And fall on my side so against your will.

**VER.**
==52==If I, my lord, for my opinion bleed,
==53==Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt,
==54==And keep me on the side where still I am.

**SOM.**
==55==Well, well, come on, who else?

**LAW.**
==56==Unless my study and my books be false,
==57==The argument you held was wrong in you;
*(To Somerset.)*
==58==In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.

**PLAN.**
==59==Now, Somerset, where is your argument?

**SOM.**
==60==Here in my scabbard, meditating that
==61==Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.

**PLAN.**
==62==Mean time your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;
==63==For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
==64==The truth on our side.

**SOM.**
==64==              No, Plantagenet;
==65==’Tis not for fear, but anger, that thy cheeks
==66==Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
==67==And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.

**PLAN.**
==68==Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?

**SOM.**
==69==Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?

**PLAN.**
==70==Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth,
==71==Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.

**SOM.**
==72==Well, I’ll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
==73==That shall maintain what I have said is true,
==74==Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.

**PLAN.**
==75==Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
==76==I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.

**SUF.**
==77==Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.

**PLAN.**
==78==Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.

**SUF.**
==79==I’ll turn my part thereof into thy throat.

**SOM.**
==80==Away, away, good William de la Pole!
==81==We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.

**WAR.**
==82==Now, by God’s will, thou wrong’st him, Somerset;
==83==His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,
==84==Third son to the third Edward, King of England.
==85==Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?

**PLAN.**
==86==He bears him on the place’s privilege,
==87==Or durst not for his craven heart say thus.

**SOM.**
==88==By Him that made me, I’ll maintain my words
==89==On any plot of ground in Christendom.
==90==Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,
==91==For treason executed in our late king’s days?
==92==And by his treason, stand’st not thou attainted,
==93==Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
==94==His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood,
==95==And till thou be restor’d, thou art a yeoman.

**PLAN.**
==96==My father was attached, not attainted,
==97==Condemn’d to die for treason, but no traitor;
==98==And that I’ll prove on better men than Somerset,
==99==Were growing time once ripened to my will.
==100==For your partaker Pole, and you yourself,
==101==I’ll note you in my book of memory,
==102==To scourge you for this apprehension.
==103==Look to it well, and say you are well warn’d.

**SOM.**
==104==Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;
==105==And know us by these colors for thy foes,
==106==For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.

**PLAN.**
==107==And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
==108==As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
==109==Will I forever and my faction wear,
==110==Until it wither with me to my grave,
==111==Or flourish to the height of my degree.

**SUF.**
==112==Go forward, and be chok’d with thy ambition!
==113==And so farewell until I meet thee next.

*Exit.*

**SOM.**
==114==Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.

*Exit.*

**PLAN.**
==115==How I am brav’d, and must perforce endure it!

**WAR.**
==116==This blot that they object against your house
==117==Shall be wip’d out in the next parliament,
==118==Call’d for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
==119==And if thou be not then created York,
==120==I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
==121==Mean time, in signal of my love to thee,
==122==Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
==123==Will I upon thy party wear this rose.
==124==And here I prophesy: this brawl today,
==125==Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden,
==126==Shall send between the Red Rose and the White
==127==A thousand souls to death and deadly night.

**PLAN.**
==128==Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you
==129==That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.

**VER.**
==130==In your behalf still will I wear the same.

**LAW.**
==131==And so will I.

**PLAN.**
==131==        Thanks, gentlemen.
==132==Come, let us four to dinner. I dare say
==133==This quarrel will drink blood another day.

*Exeunt.*
