## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*Anjou. Camp of the Duke of York.*

*Enter York, Warwick, Shepherd, Pucelle guarded.*

**YORK.**
==1==Bring forth that sorceress condemn’d to burn.

**SHEP.**
==2==Ah, Joan, this kills thy father’s heart outright!
==3==Have I sought every country far and near,
==4==And now it is my chance to find thee out,
==5==Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
==6==Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I’ll die with thee!

**PUC.**
==7==Decrepit miser! Base ignoble wretch!
==8==I am descended of a gentler blood.
==9==Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.

**SHEP.**
==10==Out, out! My lords, and please you, ’tis not so,
==11==I did beget her, all the parish knows.
==12==Her mother liveth yet, can testify
==13==She was the first fruit of my bach’lorship.

**WAR.**
==14==Graceless, wilt thou deny thy parentage?

**YORK.**
==15==This argues what her kind of life hath been,
==16==Wicked and vile, and so her death concludes.

**SHEP.**
==17==Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
==18==God knows thou art a collop of my flesh,
==19==And for thy sake have I shed many a tear.
==20==Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.

**PUC.**
==21==Peasant, avaunt!—You have suborn’d this man
==22==Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.

**SHEP.**
==23==’Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
==24==The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
==25==Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
==26==Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
==27==Of thy nativity! I would the milk
==28==Thy mother gave thee, when thou suck’st her breast,
==29==Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
==30==Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
==31==I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
==32==Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
==33==O, burn her, burn her! Hanging is too good.

*Exit.*

**YORK.**
==34==Take her away, for she hath liv’d too long,
==35==To fill the world with vicious qualities.

**PUC.**
==36==First let me tell you whom you have condemn’d:
==37==Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
==38==But issued from the progeny of kings;
==39==Virtuous and holy, chosen from above,
==40==By inspiration of celestial grace,
==41==To work exceeding miracles on earth.
==42==I never had to do with wicked spirits.
==43==But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
==44==Stain’d with the guiltless blood of innocents,
==45==Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
==46==Because you want the grace that others have,
==47==You judge it straight a thing impossible
==48==To compass wonders but by help of devils.
==49==No, misconceived! Joan of Aire hath been
==50==A virgin from her tender infancy,
==51==Chaste, and immaculate in very thought,
==52==Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effus’d,
==53==Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.

**YORK.**
==54==Ay, ay; away with her to execution!

**WAR.**
==55==And hark ye, sirs: because she is a maid,
==56==Spare for no faggots, let there be enow.
==57==Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,
==58==That so her torture may be shortened.

**PUC.**
==59==Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
==60==Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,
==61==That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
==62==I am with child, ye bloody homicides!
==63==Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
==64==Although ye hale me to a violent death.

**YORK.**
==65==Now heaven forfend, the holy maid with child?

**WAR.**
==66==The greatest miracle that e’er ye wrought!
==67==Is all your strict preciseness come to this?

**YORK.**
==68==She and the Dauphin have been juggling.
==69==I did imagine what would be her refuge.

**WAR.**
==70==Well, go to, we’ll have no bastards live,
==71==Especially since Charles must father it.

**PUC.**
==72==You are deceiv’d, my child is none of his,
==73==It was Alanson that enjoy’d my love.

**YORK.**
==74==Alanson, that notorious Machevile?
==75==It dies, and if it had a thousand lives.

**PUC.**
==76==O, give me leave, I have deluded you,
==77==’Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I nam’d,
==78==But Reignier, King of Naples, that prevail’d.

**WAR.**
==79==A married man! That’s most intolerable.

**YORK.**
==80==Why, here’s a girl! I think she knows not well
==81==(There were so many) whom she may accuse.

**WAR.**
==82==It’s sign she hath been liberal and free.

**YORK.**
==83==And yet forsooth she is a virgin pure.
==84==Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee.
==85==Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.

**PUC.**
==86==Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:
==87==May never glorious sun reflex his beams
==88==Upon the country where you make abode;
==89==But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
==90==Environ you, till mischief and despair
==91==Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!

*Exit guarded.*

**YORK.**
==92==Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,
==93==Thou foul accursed minister of hell!

*Enter Winchester, now Cardinal Beauford, attended.*

**CAR.**
==94==Lord Regent, I do greet your Excellence
==95==With letters of commission from the King.
==96==For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
==97==Mov’d with remorse of these outrageous broils,
==98==Have earnestly implor’d a general peace
==99==Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
==100==And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
==101==Approacheth, to confer about some matter.

**YORK.**
==102==Is all our travail turn’d to this effect?
==103==After the slaughter of so many peers,
==104==So many captains, gentlemen, and soldiers,
==105==That in this quarrel have been overthrown
==106==And sold their bodies for their country’s benefit,
==107==Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
==108==Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
==109==By treason, falsehood, and by treachery,
==110==Our great progenitors had conquered?
==111==O Warwick, Warwick, I foresee with grief
==112==The utter loss of all the realm of France.

**WAR.**
==113==Be patient, York. If we conclude a peace,
==114==It shall be with such strict and severe covenants,
==115==As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.

*Enter Charles, Alanson, Bastard, Reignier, and others.*

**CHAR.**
==116==Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
==117==That peaceful truce shall be proclaim’d in France,
==118==We come to be informed by yourselves
==119==What the conditions of that league must be.

**YORK.**
==120==Speak, Winchester, for boiling choler chokes
==121==The hollow passage of my poison’d voice,
==122==By sight of these our baleful enemies.

**CAR.**
==123==Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
==124==That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
==125==Of mere compassion and of lenity,
==126==To ease your country of distressful war
==127==And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
==128==You shall become true liegemen to his crown.
==129==And, Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
==130==To pay him tribute and submit thyself,
==131==Thou shalt be plac’d as viceroy under him,
==132==And still enjoy thy regal dignity.

**ALAN.**
==133==Must he be then as shadow of himself?
==134==Adorn his temples with a coronet,
==135==And yet, in substance and authority,
==136==Retain but privilege of a private man?
==137==This proffer is absurd and reasonless.

**CHAR.**
==138==’Tis known already that I am possess’d
==139==With more than half the Gallian territories,
==140==And therein reverenc’d for their lawful king.
==141==Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish’d,
==142==Detract so much from that prerogative
==143==As to be call’d but viceroy of the whole?
==144==No, lord ambassador, I’ll rather keep
==145==That which I have than, coveting for more,
==146==Be cast from possibility of all.

**YORK.**
==147==Insulting Charles, hast thou by secret means
==148==Us’d intercession to obtain a league,
==149==And, now the matter grows to compromise,
==150==Stand’st thou aloof upon comparison?
==151==Either accept the title thou usurp’st,
==152==Of benefit proceeding from our king,
==153==And not of any challenge of desert,
==154==Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.

**REIG.**
*(Aside to Charles.)*
==155==My lord, you do not well in obstinacy
==156==To cavil in the course of this contract.
==157==If once it be neglected, ten to one
==158==We shall not find like opportunity.

**ALAN.**
*(Aside to Charles.)*
==159==To say the truth, it is your policy
==160==To save your subjects from such massacre
==161==And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
==162==By our proceeding in hostility,
==163==And therefore take this compact of a truce,
==164==Although you break it when your pleasure serves.

**WAR.**
==165==How say’st thou, Charles? Shall our condition stand?

**CHAR.**
==166==It shall;
==167==Only reserv’d, you claim no interest
==168==In any of our towns of garrison.

**YORK.**
==169==Then swear allegiance to his Majesty,
==170==As thou art knight, never to disobey
==171==Nor be rebellious to the crown of England.
==172==Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.
*(Charles and his party give tokens of fealty.)*
==173==So, now dismiss your army when ye please;
==174==Hang up your ensigns, let your drums be still,
==175==For here we entertain a solemn peace.

*Exeunt.*
