## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*English camp near Bourdeaux.*

*Enter Talbot and his son, John.*

**TAL.**
==1== O young John Talbot, I did send for thee
==2== To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
==3== That Talbot’s name might be in thee reviv’d,
==4== When sapless age and weak unable limbs
==5== Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
==6== But O malignant and ill-boding stars!
==7== Now thou art come unto a feast of death,
==8== A terrible and unavoided danger;
==9== Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
==10== And I’ll direct thee how thou shalt escape
==11== By sudden flight. Come, dally not, be gone.

**JOHN.**
==12== Is my name Talbot? And am I your son?
==13== And shall I fly? O, if you love my mother,
==14== Dishonor not her honorable name
==15== To make a bastard and a slave of me!
==16== The world will say, he is not Talbot’s blood,
==17== That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.

**TAL.**
==18== Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.

**JOHN.**
==19== He that flies so will ne’er return again.

**TAL.**
==20== If we both stay, we both are sure to die.

**JOHN.**
==21== Then let me stay, and, father, do you fly.
==22== Your loss is great, so your regard should be;
==23== My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.
==24== Upon my death the French can little boast;
==25== In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.
==26== Flight cannot stain the honor you have won,
==27== But mine it will, that no exploit have done.
==28== You fled for vantage, every one will swear;
==29== But if I bow, they’ll say it was for fear.
==30== There is no hope that ever I will stay,
==31== If the first hour I shrink and run away.
==32== Here on my knee I beg mortality,
==33== Rather than life preserv’d with infamy.

**TAL.**
==34== Shall all thy mother’s hopes lie in one tomb?

**JOHN.**
==35== Ay, rather than I’ll shame my mother’s womb.

**TAL.**
==36== Upon my blessing I command thee go.

**JOHN.**
==37== To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.

**TAL.**
==38== Part of thy father may be sav’d in thee.

**JOHN.**
==39== No part of him but will be shame in me.

**TAL.**
==40== Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.

**JOHN.**
==41== Yes, your renowned name. Shall flight abuse it?

**TAL.**
==42== Thy father’s charge shall clear thee from that stain.

**JOHN.**
==43== You cannot witness for me, being slain.
==44== If death be so apparent, then both fly.

**TAL.**
==45== And leave my followers here to fight and die?
==46== My age was never tainted with such shame.

**JOHN.**
==47== And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
==48== No more can I be severed from your side
==49== Than can yourself yourself in twain divide.
==50== Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;
==51== For live I will not if my father die.

**TAL.**
==52== Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,
==53== Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.
==54== Come, side by side, together live and die,
==55== And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.

*Exeunt.*
