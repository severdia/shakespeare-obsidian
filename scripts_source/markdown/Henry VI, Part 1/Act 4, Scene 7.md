## Act 4, Scene 7
[[Act 4, Scene 6|← Act 4, Scene 6]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the battlefield.*

*Alarum. Excursions. Enter old Talbot led by his Servant.*

**TAL.**
==1==Where is my other life? Mine own is gone.
==2==O, where’s young Talbot? Where is valiant John?
==3==Triumphant Death, smear’d with captivity,
==4==Young Talbot’s valor makes me smile at thee.
==5==When he perceiv’d me shrink and on my knee,
==6==His bloody sword he brandish’d over me,
==7==And like a hungry lion did commence
==8==Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
==9==But when my angry guardant stood alone,
==10==Tend’ring my ruin and assail’d of none,
==11==Dizzy-ey’d fury and great rage of heart
==12==Suddenly made him from my side to start
==13==Into the clust’ring battle of the French;
==14==And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
==15==His overmounting spirit; and there died
==16==My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

*Enter Soldiers with John Talbot borne.*

**TAL. SERV.**
==17==O my dear lord, lo where your son is borne!

**TAL.**
==18==Thou antic Death, which laugh’st us here to scorn,
==19==Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,
==20==Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
==21==Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
==22==In thy despite shall scape mortality.
==23==O thou whose wounds become hard-favored Death,
==24==Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
==25==Brave Death by speaking, whether he will or no;
==26==Imagine him a Frenchman, and thy foe.
==27==Poor boy, he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
==28==Had Death been French, then Death had died today.
==29==Come, come, and lay him in his father’s arms,
==30==My spirit can no longer bear these harms.
==31==Soldiers, *adieu*! I have what I would have,
==32==Now my old arms are young John Talbot’s grave.

*Dies.*

*Enter Charles, Alanson, Burgundy, Bastard, and Pucelle with forces.*

**CHAR.**
==33==Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,
==34==We should have found a bloody day of this.

**BAST.**
==35==How the young whelp of Talbot’s, raging wood,
==36==Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen’s blood!

**PUC.**
==37==Once I encount’red him, and thus I said:
==38==“Thou maiden youth, be vanquish’d by a maid!”
==39==But with a proud majestical high scorn
==40==He answer’d thus: “Young Talbot was not born
==41==To be the pillage of a giglot wench.”
==42==So rushing in the bowels of the French,
==43==He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.

**BUR.**
==44==Doubtless he would have made a noble knight.
==45==See where he lies inhearsed in the arms
==46==Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!

**BAST.**
==47==Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder,
==48==Whose life was England’s glory, Gallia’s wonder.

**CHAR.**
==49==O no, forbear! For that which we have fled
==50==During the life, let us not wrong it dead.

*Enter Lucy attended, Herald of the French preceding.*

**LUCY.**
==51==Herald, conduct me to the Dauphin’s tent,
==52==To know who hath obtain’d the glory of the day.

**CHAR.**
==53==On what submissive message art thou sent?

**LUCY.**
==54==Submission, Dauphin? ’Tis a mere French word;
==55==We English warriors wot not what it means.
==56==I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta’en,
==57==And to survey the bodies of the dead.

**CHAR.**
==58==For prisoners ask’st thou? Hell our prison is.
==59==But tell me whom thou seek’st.

**LUCY.**
==60==But where’s the great Alcides of the field,
==61==Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,
==62==Created, for his rare success in arms,
==63==Great Earl of Washford, Waterford, and Valence,
==64==Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,
==65==Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdon of Alton,
==66==Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,
==67==The thrice-victorious Lord of Faulconbridge,
==68==Knight of the noble Order of Saint George,
==69==Worthy Saint Michael, and the Golden Fleece,
==70==Great marshal to Henry the Sixth
==71==Of all his wars within the realm of France?

**PUC.**
==72==Here’s a silly stately style indeed!
==73==The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,
==74==Writes not so tedious a style as this.
==75==Him that thou magnifi’st with all these titles
==76==Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.

**LUCY.**
==77==Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen’s only scourge,
==78==Your kingdom’s terror and black Nemesis?
==79==O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn’d,
==80==That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!
==81==O, that I could but call these dead to life,
==82==It were enough to fright the realm of France!
==83==Were but his picture left amongst you here,
==84==It would amaze the proudest of you all.
==85==Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence
==86==And give them burial as beseems their worth.

**PUC.**
==87==I think this upstart is old Talbot’s ghost,
==88==He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.
==89==For God’s sake let him have ’em; to keep them here,
==90==They would but stink, and putrefy the air.

**CHAR.**
==91==Go take their bodies hence.

**LUCY.**
==92==I’ll bear them hence; but from their ashes shall be rear’d
==93==A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.

**CHAR.**
==94==So we be rid of them, do with ’em what thou wilt.
==95==And now to Paris in this conquering vein,
==96==All will be ours, now bloody Talbot’s slain.

*Exeunt.*
