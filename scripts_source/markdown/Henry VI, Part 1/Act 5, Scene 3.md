## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*France. Before Angiers.*

*Alarum. Excursions. Enter Joan de Pucelle.*

**PUC.**
==1==The Regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly.
==2==Now help, ye charming spells and periapts,
==3==And ye choice spirits that admonish me
==4==And give me signs of future accidents.
*(Thunder.)*
==5==You speedy helpers, that are substitutes
==6==Under the lordly Monarch of the North,
==7==Appear, and aid me in this enterprise.
*(Enter Fiends.)*
==8==This speedy and quick appearance argues proof
==9==Of your accustom’d diligence to me.
==10==Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull’d
==11==Out of the powerful regions under earth,
==12==Help me this once, that France may get the field.
*(They walk, and speak not.)*
==13==O, hold me not with silence over-long!
==14==Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,
==15==I’ll lop a member off and give it you
==16==In earnest of a further benefit,
==17==So you do condescend to help me now.
*(They hang their heads.)*
==18==No hope to have redress? My body shall
==19==Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.
*(They shake their heads.)*
==20==Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice
==21==Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?
==22==Then take my soul—my body, soul, and all,
==23==Before that England give the French the foil.
*(They depart.)*
==24==See, they forsake me! Now the time is come
==25==That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest
==26==And let her head fall into England’s lap.
==27==My ancient incantations are too weak,
==28==And hell too strong for me to buckle with:
==29==Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.

*Exit.*

*Excursions. Burgundy and York enter and fight hand to hand.*

*French fly. Pucelle is brought in captive.*

**YORK.**
==30==Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:
==31==Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms,
==32==And try if they can gain your liberty.
==33==A goodly prize, fit for the devil’s grace!
==34==See how the ugly witch doth bend her brows,
==35==As if, with Circe, she would change my shape!

**PUC.**
==36==Chang’d to a worser shape thou canst not be.

**YORK.**
==37==O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man,
==38==No shape but his can please your dainty eye.

**PUC.**
==39==A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!
==40==And may ye both be suddenly surpris’d
==41==By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!

**YORK.**
==42==Fell banning hag, enchantress, hold thy tongue!

**PUC.**
==43==I prithee give me leave to curse a while.

**YORK.**
==44==Curse, miscreant, when thou com’st to the stake.

*Exeunt.*

*Alarum. Enter Suffolk with Margaret in his hand.*

**SUF.**
==45==Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.
*(Gazes on her.)*
==46==O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly,
==47==For I will touch thee but with reverend hands.
==48==I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,
==49==And lay them gently on thy tender side.
==50==Who art thou? Say, that I may honor thee.

**MARG.**
==51==Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,
==52==The King of Naples, whosoe’er thou art.

**SUF.**
==53==An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call’d.
==54==Be not offended, nature’s miracle,
==55==Thou art allotted to be ta’en by me;
==56==So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,
==57==Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.
==58==Yet, if this servile usage once offend,
==59==Go, and be free again, as Suffolk’s friend.
*(She is going.)*
==60==O, stay!
*(Aside.)*
==60==    I have no power to let her pass,
==61==My hand would free her, but my heart says no.
==62==As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,
==63==Twinkling another counterfeited beam,
==64==So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.
==65==Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:
==66==I’ll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.
==67==Fie, De la Pole, disable not thyself.
==68==Hast not a tongue? Is she not here?
==69==Wilt thou be daunted at a woman’s sight?
==70==Ay; beauty’s princely majesty is such,
==71==’Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.

**MARG.**
==72==Say, Earl of Suffolk—if thy name be so⁠—
==73==What ransom must I pay before I pass?
==74==For I perceive I am thy prisoner.

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==75==How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,
==76==Before thou make a trial of her love?

**MARG.**
==77==Why speak’st thou not? What ransom must I pay?

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==78==She’s beautiful; and therefore to be wooed:
==79==She is a woman; therefore to be won.

**MARG.**
==80==Wilt thou accept of ransom, yea or no?

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==81==Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife,
==82==Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?

**MARG.**
==83==I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==84==There all is marr’d; there lies a cooling card.

**MARG.**
==85==He talks at random; sure the man is mad.

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==86==And yet a dispensation may be had.

**MARG.**
==87==And yet I would that you would answer me.

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==88==I’ll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
==89==Why, for my king. Tush, that’s a wooden thing!

**MARG.**
==90==He talks of wood; it is some carpenter.

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==91==Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
==92==And peace established between these realms.
==93==But there remains a scruple in that too;
==94==For though her father be the King of Naples,
==95==Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
==96==And our nobility will scorn the match.

**MARG.**
==97==Hear ye, captain? Are you not at leisure?

**SUF.**
*(Aside.)*
==98==It shall be so, disdain they ne’er so much.
==99==Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.⁠—
==100==Madam, I have a secret to reveal.

**MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==101==What though I be enthrall’d, he seems a knight,
==102==And will not any way dishonor me.

**SUF.**
==103==Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.

**MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==104==Perhaps I shall be rescu’d by the French,
==105==And then I need not crave his courtesy.

**SUF.**
==106==Sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause.

**MARG.**
*(Aside.)*
==107==Tush, women have been captivate ere now.

**SUF.**
==108==Lady, wherefore talk you so?

**MARG.**
==109==I cry you mercy, ’tis but *quid* for *quo*.

**SUF.**
==110==Say, gentle Princess, would you not suppose
==111==Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?

**MARG.**
==112==To be a queen in bondage is more vile
==113==Than is a slave in base servility;
==114==For princes should be free.

**SUF.**
==114==              And so shall you,
==115==If happy England’s royal king be free.

**MARG.**
==116==Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?

**SUF.**
==117==I’ll undertake to make thee Henry’s queen,
==118==To put a golden scepter in thy hand,
==119==And set a precious crown upon thy head,
==120==If thou wilt condescend to be my⁠—

**MARG.**
==120==                  What?

**SUF.**
==121==His love.

**MARG.**
==122==I am unworthy to be Henry’s wife.

**SUF.**
==123==No, gentle madam, I unworthy am
==124==To woo so fair a dame to be his wife
==125==And have no portion in the choice myself.
==126==How say you, madam, are ye so content?

**MARG.**
==127==And if my father please, I am content.

**SUF.**
==128==Then call our captains and our colors forth,
==129==And, madam, at your father’s castle walls
==130==We’ll crave a parley, to confer with him.
*(Sound a parley. Enter Reignier on the walls.)*
==131==See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!

**REIG.**
==132==To whom?

**SUF.**
==132==        To me.

**REIG.**
==132==              Suffolk, what remedy?
==133==I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,
==134==Or to exclaim on fortune’s fickleness.

**SUF.**
==135==Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord.
==136==Consent, and for thy honor give consent,
==137==Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king,
==138==Whom I with pain have wooed and won thereto;
==139==And this her easy-held imprisonment
==140==Hath gain’d thy daughter princely liberty.

**REIG.**
==141==Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?

**SUF.**
==141==                Fair Margaret knows
==142==That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.

**REIG.**
==143==Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
==144==To give thee answer of thy just demand.

*Exit from the walls.*

**SUF.**
==145==And here I will expect thy coming.

*Trumpets sound. Enter Reignier below.*

**REIG.**
==146==Welcome, brave Earl, into our territories!
==147==Command in Anjou what your honor pleases.

**SUF.**
==148==Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
==149==Fit to be made companion with a king.
==150==What answer makes your Grace unto my suit?

**REIG.**
==151==Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
==152==To be the princely bride of such a lord,
==153==Upon condition I may quietly
==154==Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,
==155==Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
==156==My daughter shall be Henry’s, if he please.

**SUF.**
==157==That is her ransom; I deliver her,
==158==And those two counties I will undertake
==159==Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy.

**REIG.**
==160==And I again, in Henry’s royal name,
==161==As deputy unto that gracious king,
==162==Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.

**SUF.**
==163==Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
==164==Because this is in traffic of a king.
*(Aside.)*
==165==And yet methinks I could be well content
==166==To be mine own attorney in this case.⁠—
==167==I’ll over then to England with this news,
==168==And make this marriage to be solemniz’d.
==169==So farewell, Reignier! Set this diamond safe
==170==In golden palaces, as it becomes.

**REIG.**
==171==I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
==172==The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.

**MARG.**
==173==Farewell, my lord! Good wishes, praise, and prayers
==174==Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.

*She is going.*

**SUF.**
==175==Farewell, sweet madam! But hark you, Margaret,
==176==No princely commendations to my king?

**MARG.**
==177==Such commendations as becomes a maid,
==178==A virgin, and his servant, say to him.

**SUF.**
==179==Words sweetly plac’d and modestly directed.
==180==But, madam, I must trouble you again,
==181==No loving token to his Majesty?

**MARG.**
==182==Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,
==183==Never yet taint with love, I send the King.

**SUF.**
==184==And this withal.

*Kiss her.*

**MARG.**
==185==That for thyself; I will not so presume
==186==To send such peevish tokens to a king.

*Exeunt Reignier and Margaret.*

**SUF.**
==187==O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay,
==188==Thou mayest not wander in that labyrinth,
==189==There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
==190==Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise;
==191==Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,
==192==And natural graces that extinguish art;
==193==Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
==194==That, when thou com’st to kneel at Henry’s feet,
==195==Thou mayest bereave him of his wits with wonder.

*Exit.*
