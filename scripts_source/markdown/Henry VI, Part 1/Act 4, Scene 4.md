## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*France. Other plains in Gascony.*

*Enter Somerset with his army, a Captain of Talbot’s with him.*

**SOM.**
==1== It is too late, I cannot send them now.
==2== This expedition was by York and Talbot
==3== Too rashly plotted. All our general force
==4== Might with a sally of the very town
==5== Be buckled with. The over-daring Talbot
==6== Hath sullied all his gloss of former honor
==7== By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure.
==8== York set him on to fight and die in shame,
==9== That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.

**CAPT.**
==10== Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me
==11== Set from our o’ermatch’d forces forth for aid.

**SOM.**
==12== How now, Sir William, whither were you sent?

**LUCY.**
==13== Whither, my lord? From bought and sold Lord Talbot,
==14== Who, ring’d about with bold adversity,
==15== Cries out for noble York and Somerset
==16== To beat assailing death from his weak legions;
==17== And whiles the honorable captain there
==18== Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,
==19== And, in advantage ling’ring, looks for rescue,
==20== You, his false hopes, the trust of England’s honor,
==21== Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.
==22== Let not your private discord keep away
==23== The levied succors that should lend him aid,
==24== While he, renowned noble gentleman,
==25== Yield up his life unto a world of odds.
==26== Orléans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,
==27== Alanson, Reignier, compass him about,
==28== And Talbot perisheth by your default.

**SOM.**
==29== York set him on, York should have sent him aid.

**LUCY.**
==30== And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims,
==31== Swearing that you withhold his levied host,
==32== Collected for this expedition.

**SOM.**
==33== York lies; he might have sent, and had the horse.
==34== I owe him little duty, and less love,
==35== And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.

**LUCY.**
==36== The fraud of England, not the force of France,
==37== Hath now entrapp’d the noble-minded Talbot:
==38== Never to England shall he bear his life,
==39== But dies, betray’d to fortune by your strife.

**SOM.**
==40== Come go, I will dispatch the horsemen straight;
==41== Within six hours they will be at his aid.

**LUCY.**
==42== Too late comes rescue, he is ta’en or slain;
==43== For fly he could not, if he would have fled;
==44== And fly would Talbot never, though he might.

**SOM.**
==45== If he be dead, brave Talbot, then *adieu*!

**LUCY.**
==46== His fame lives in the world, his shame in you.

*Exeunt.*
