## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Auvergne. Court of the Countess’s castle.*

*Enter Countess of Auvergne and her Porter.*

**COUNT.**
==1==Porter, remember what I gave in charge,
==2==And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.

**PORT.**
==3==Madam, I will.

*Exit.*

**COUNT.**
==4==The plot is laid. If all things fall out right,
==5==I shall as famous be by this exploit
==6==As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus’ death.
==7==Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,
==8==And his achievements of no less account;
==9==Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears
==10==To give their censure of these rare reports.

*Enter Messenger of the Countess and Talbot.*

**MESS. COUNT.**
==11==Madam,
==12==According as your ladyship desir’d,
==13==By message crav’d, so is Lord Talbot come.

**COUNT.**
==14==And he is welcome. What? Is this the man?

**MESS. COUNT.**
==15==Madam, it is.

**COUNT.**
==15==        Is this the scourge of France?
==16==Is this the Talbot, so much fear’d abroad
==17==That with his name the mothers still their babes?
==18==I see report is fabulous and false.
==19==I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
==20==A second Hector, for his grim aspect
==21==And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
==22==Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
==23==It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
==24==Should strike such terror to his enemies.

**TAL.**
==25==Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;
==26==But since your ladyship is not at leisure,
==27==I’ll sort some other time to visit you.

*Going.*

**COUNT.**
==28==What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.

**MESS. COUNT.**
==29==Stay, my Lord Talbot, for my lady craves
==30==To know the cause of your abrupt departure.

**TAL.**
==31==Marry, for that she’s in a wrong belief,
==32==I go to certify her Talbot’s here.

*Enter Porter with keys.*

**COUNT.**
==33==If thou be he, then art thou prisoner.

**TAL.**
==34==Prisoner? To whom?

**COUNT.**
==34==           To me, blood-thirsty lord;
==35==And for that cause I train’d thee to my house.
==36==Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
==37==For in my gallery thy picture hangs;
==38==But now the substance shall endure the like,
==39==And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
==40==That hast by tyranny these many years
==41==Wasted our country, slain our citizens,
==42==And sent our sons and husbands captivate.

**TAL.**
==43==Ha, ha, ha!

**COUNT.**
==44==Laughest thou, wretch? Thy mirth shall turn to moan.

**TAL.**
==45==I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
==46==To think that you have aught but Talbot’s shadow
==47==Whereon to practice your severity.

**COUNT.**
==48==Why? Art not thou the man?

**TAL.**
==48==                I am indeed.

**COUNT.**
==49==Then have I substance too.

**TAL.**
==50==No, no, I am but shadow of myself.
==51==You are deceiv’d, my substance is not here;
==52==For what you see is but the smallest part
==53==And least proportion of humanity.
==54==I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
==55==It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
==56==Your roof were not sufficient to contain’t.

**COUNT.**
==57==This is a riddling merchant for the nonce:
==58==He will be here, and yet he is not here.
==59==How can these contrarieties agree?

**TAL.**
==60==That will I show you presently.
*(Winds his horn. Drums strike up; a peal of ordinance.)*
*(Enter Talbot’s Soldiers.)*
==61==How say you, madam? Are you now persuaded
==62==That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
==63==These are his substance, sinews, arms, and strength,
==64==With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
==65==Razeth your cities, and subverts your towns,
==66==And in a moment makes them desolate.

**COUNT.**
==67==Victorious Talbot, pardon my abuse.
==68==I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited,
==69==And more than may be gathered by thy shape.
==70==Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath,
==71==For I am sorry that with reverence
==72==I did not entertain thee as thou art.

**TAL.**
==73==Be not dismay’d, fair lady, nor misconster
==74==The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake
==75==The outward composition of his body.
==76==What you have done hath not offended me;
==77==Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
==78==But only, with your patience, that we may
==79==Taste of your wine and see what cates you have,
==80==For soldiers’ stomachs always serve them well.

**COUNT.**
==81==With all my heart, and think me honored
==82==To feast so great a warrior in my house.

*Exeunt.*
