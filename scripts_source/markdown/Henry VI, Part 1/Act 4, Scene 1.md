## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Paris. A hall of state.*

*Enter King, Gloucester, Winchester, York, Suffolk, Somerset, Warwick, Talbot, and Governor of Paris, Exeter, and others.*

**GLOU.**
==1== Lord Bishop, set the crown upon his head.

**WIN.**
==2== God save King Henry, of that name the sixt!

**GLOU.**
==3== Now, Governor of Paris, take your oath:
*(Governor kneels.)*
==4== That you elect no other king but him;
==5== Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,
==6== And none your foes but such as shall pretend
==7== Malicious practices against his state.
==8== This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!

*Exeunt Governor and Train.*

*Enter Falstaff.*

**FAL.**
==9== My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Callice,
==10== To haste unto your coronation,
==11== A letter was deliver’d to my hands,
==12== Writ to your Grace from th’ Duke of Burgundy.

*Presents it.*

**TAL.**
==13== Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
==14== I vow’d, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
==15== To tear the Garter from thy craven’s leg,
*(Plucking it off.)*
==16== Which I have done, because (unworthily) 
==17== Thou wast installed in that high degree.
==18== Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest.
==19== This dastard, at the battle of Poictiers,
==20== When (but in all) I was six thousand strong
==21== And that the French were almost ten to one,
==22== Before we met, or that a stroke was given,
==23== Like to a trusty squire did run away;
==24== In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
==25== Myself and diverse gentlemen beside
==26== Were there surpris’d and taken prisoners.
==27== Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;
==28== Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
==29== This ornament of knighthood, yea or no?

**GLOU.**
==30== To say the truth, this fact was infamous
==31== And ill beseeming any common man,
==32== Much more a knight, a captain, and a leader.

**TAL.**
==33== When first this order was ordain’d, my lords,
==34== Knights of the Garter were of noble birth,
==35== Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
==36== Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
==37== Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
==38== But always resolute in most extremes.
==39== He then, that is not furnish’d in this sort,
==40== Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
==41== Profaning this most honorable order,
==42== And should (if I were worthy to be judge) 
==43== Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
==44== That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.

**KING.**
==45== Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear’st thy doom!
==46== Be packing therefore, thou that wast a knight;
==47== Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.
*(Exit Falstaff.)*
==48== And now, Lord Protector, view the letter
==49== Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.

**GLOU.**
==50== What means his Grace, that he hath chang’d his style?
==51== No more but plain and bluntly “To the King”?
==52== Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
==53== Or doth this churlish superscription
==54== Pretend some alteration in good will?
==55== What’s here?
*(Reads.)*
==56== *“I have, upon especial cause,*
==57== *Mov’d with compassion of my country’s wrack,*
==58== *Together with the pitiful complaints*
==59== *Of such as your oppression feeds upon,*
==60== *Forsaken your pernicious faction*
==61== *And join’d with Charles, the rightful King of France.”*
==62== O monstrous treachery! Can this be so?
==63== That in alliance, amity, and oaths,
==64== There should be found such false dissembling guile?

**KING.**
==65== What? Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?

**GLOU.**
==66== He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.

**KING.**
==67== Is that the worst this letter doth contain?

**GLOU.**
==68== It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.

**KING.**
==69== Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with him,
==70== And give him chastisement for this abuse.
==71== How say you, my lord? Are you not content?

**TAL.**
==72== Content, my liege? Yes. But that I am prevented,
==73== I should have begg’d I might have been employ’d.

**KING.**
==74== Then gather strength and march unto him straight.
==75== Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason,
==76== And what offense it is to flout his friends.

**TAL.**
==77== I go, my lord, in heart desiring still
==78== You may behold confusion of your foes.

*Exit.*

*Enter Vernon and Basset.*

**VER.**
==79== Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.

**BAS.**
==80== And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.

**YORK.**
==81== This is my servant, hear him, noble prince.

**SOM.**
==82== And this is mine, sweet Henry, favor him.

**KING.**
==83== Be patient, lords, and give them leave to speak.
==84== Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?
==85== And wherefore crave you combat? Or with whom?

**VER.**
==86== With him, my lord, for he hath done me wrong.

**BAS.**
==87== And I with him, for he hath done me wrong.

**KING.**
==88== What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
==89== First let me know, and then I’ll answer you.

**BAS.**
==90== Crossing the sea from England into France,
==91== This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
==92== Upbraided me about the rose I wear,
==93== Saying the sanguine color of the leaves
==94== Did represent my master’s blushing cheeks,
==95== When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
==96== About a certain question in the law
==97== Argu’d betwixt the Duke of York and him;
==98== With other vile and ignominious terms:
==99== In confutation of which rude reproach,
==100== And in defense of my lord’s worthiness,
==101== I crave the benefit of law of arms.

**VER.**
==102== And that is my petition, noble lord.
==103== For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
==104== To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
==105== Yet know, my lord, I was provok’d by him,
==106== And he first took exceptions at this badge,
==107== Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
==108== Bewray’d the faintness of my master’s heart.

**YORK.**
==109== Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?

**SOM.**
==110== Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
==111== Though ne’er so cunningly you smother it.

**KING.**
==112== Good Lord, what madness rules in brain-sick men,
==113== When for so slight and frivolous a cause
==114== Such factious emulations shall arise!
==115== Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,
==116== Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.

**YORK.**
==117== Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
==118== And then your Highness shall command a peace.

**SOM.**
==119== The quarrel toucheth none but us alone,
==120== Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.

**YORK.**
==121== There is my pledge, accept it, Somerset.

**VER.**
==122== Nay, let it rest where it began at first.

**BAS.**
==123== Confirm it so, mine honorable lord.

**GLOU.**
==124== Confirm it so? Confounded be your strife,
==125== And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
==126== Presumptuous vassals, are you not asham’d
==127== With this immodest clamorous outrage
==128== To trouble and disturb the King and us?
==129== And you, my lords, methinks you do not well
==130== To bear with their perverse objections;
==131== Much less to take occasion from their mouths
==132== To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves.
==133== Let me persuade you take a better course.

**EXE.**
==134== It grieves his Highness. Good my lords, be friends.

**KING.**
==135== Come hither, you that would be combatants:
==136== Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favor,
==137== Quite to forget this quarrel, and the cause.
==138== And you, my lords: remember where we are⁠—
==139== In France, amongst a fickle, wavering nation.
==140== If they perceive dissension in our looks,
==141== And that within ourselves we disagree,
==142== How will their grudging stomachs be provok’d
==143== To willful disobedience, and rebel!
==144== Beside, what infamy will there arise,
==145== When foreign princes shall be certified
==146== That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
==147== King Henry’s peers and chief nobility
==148== Destroy’d themselves, and lost the realm of France!
==149== O, think upon the conquest of my father,
==150== My tender years, and let us not forgo
==151== That for a trifle that was bought with blood!
==152== Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
==153== I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
*(Putting on a red rose.)*
==154== That any one should therefore be suspicious
==155== I more incline to Somerset than York:
==156== Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both.
==157== As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
==158== Because, forsooth, the King of Scots is crown’d.
==159== But your discretions better can persuade
==160== Than I am able to instruct or teach;
==161== And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
==162== So let us still continue peace, and love.
==163== Cousin of York, we institute your Grace
==164== To be our regent in these parts of France;
==165== And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
==166== Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot,
==167== And like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
==168== Go cheerfully together and digest
==169== Your angry choler on your enemies.
==170== Ourself, my Lord Protector, and the rest,
==171== After some respite, will return to Callice;
==172== From thence to England, where I hope ere long
==173== To be presented, by your victories,
==174== With Charles, Alanson, and that traitorous rout.

*Flourish.*

*Exeunt. Manent York, Warwick, Exeter, Vernon.*

**WAR.**
==175== My Lord of York, I promise you, the King
==176== Prettily, methought, did play the orator.

**YORK.**
==177== And so he did, but yet I like it not,
==178== In that he wears the badge of Somerset.

**WAR.**
==179== Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not.
==180== I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.

**YORK.**
==181== And if I wist he did—but let it rest,
==182== Other affairs must now be managed.

*Exeunt. Manet Exeter.*

**EXE.**
==183== Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice,
==184== For had the passions of thy heart burst out,
==185== I fear we should have seen decipher’d there
==186== More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
==187== Than yet can be imagin’d or suppos’d.
==188== But howsoe’er, no simple man that sees
==189== This jarring discord of nobility,
==190== This shouldering of each other in the court,
==191== This factious bandying of their favorites,
==192== But that it doth presage some ill event.
==193== ’Tis much, when scepters are in children’s hands;
==194== But more, when envy breeds unkind division:
==195== There comes the ruin, there begins confusion.

*Exit.*
