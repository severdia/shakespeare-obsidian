## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Orléans. Within the town.*

*Enter Talbot, Bedford, Burgundy, a Captain, and others, their Drums beating a dead march.*

**BED.**
==1==The day begins to break, and night is fled,
==2==Whose pitchy mantle over-veil’d the earth.
==3==Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.

*Retreat.*

**TAL.**
==4==Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,
==5==And here advance it in the market-place,
==6==The middle centure of this cursed town.
==7==Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;
==8==For every drop of blood was drawn from him
==9==There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
==10==And that hereafter ages may behold
==11==What ruin happened in revenge of him,
==12==Within their chiefest temple I’ll erect
==13==A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr’d;
==14==Upon the which, that every one may read,
==15==Shall be engrav’d the sack of Orléans,
==16==The treacherous manner of his mournful death,
==17==And what a terror he had been to France.
==18==But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
==19==I muse we met not with the Dauphin’s grace,
==20==His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Aire,
==21==Nor any of his false confederates.

**BED.**
==22==’Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
==23==Rous’d on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
==24==They did amongst the troops of armed men
==25==Leap o’er the walls for refuge in the field.

**BUR.**
==26==Myself, as far as I could well discern
==27==For smoke and dusky vapors of the night,
==28==Am sure I scar’d the Dauphin and his trull,
==29==When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
==30==Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
==31==That could not live asunder day or night.
==32==After that things are set in order here,
==33==We’ll follow them with all the power we have.

*Enter Messenger of the Countess.*

**MESS. COUNT.**
==34==All hail, my lords! Which of this princely train
==35==Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts
==36==So much applauded through the realm of France?

**TAL.**
==37==Here is the Talbot, who would speak with him?

**MESS. COUNT.**
==38==The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
==39==With modesty admiring thy renown,
==40==By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
==41==To visit her poor castle where she lies,
==42==That she may boast she hath beheld the man
==43==Whose glory fills the world with loud report.

**BUR.**
==44==Is it even so? Nay, then I see our wars
==45==Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,
==46==When ladies crave to be encount’red with.
==47==You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.

**TAL.**
==48==Ne’er trust me then; for when a world of men
==49==Could not prevail with all their oratory,
==50==Yet hath a woman’s kindness overrul’d;
==51==And therefore tell her I return great thanks,
==52==And in submission will attend on her.
==53==Will not your honors bear me company?

**BED.**
==54==No, truly, ’tis more than manners will;
==55==And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
==56==Are often welcomest when they are gone.

**TAL.**
==57==Well then, alone (since there’s no remedy) 
==58==I mean to prove this lady’s courtesy.
==59==Come hither, captain.
*(Whispers.)*
==59==              You perceive my mind?

**CAPT.**
==60==I do, my lord, and mean accordingly.

*Exeunt.*
