## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*France. Before Rouen.*

*Enter Pucelle, disguis’d, with four Soldiers with sacks upon their backs.*

**PUC.**
==1== These are the city-gates, the gates of Roan,
==2== Through which our policy must make a breach.
==3== Take heed, be wary how you place your words,
==4== Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
==5== That come to gather money for their corn.
==6== If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
==7== And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
==8== I’ll by a sign give notice to our friends,
==9== That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.

**1. SOLD.**
==10== Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
==11== And we be lords and rulers over Roan,
==12== Therefore we’ll knock.

*Knock.*

**SOLD. WATCH.**
*(Within.)*
==13== *Qui là?*

**PUC.**
==14== *Paysans, la pauvre gens de France,*
==15== Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.

**SOLD. WATCH.**
==16== Enter, go in, the market bell is rung.

**PUC.**
==17== Now, Roan, I’ll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.

*Exeunt to the town.*

*Enter Charles, Bastard, Alanson, Reignier, and forces.*

**CHAR.**
==18== Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
==19== And once again we’ll sleep secure in Roan.

**BAST.**
==20== Here ent’red Pucelle and her practisants.
==21== Now she is there, how will she specify
==22== Here is the best and safest passage in?

**REIG.**
==23== By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower,
==24== Which once discern’d, shows that her meaning is,
==25== No way to that, for weakness, which she ent’red.

*Enter Pucelle on the top, thrusting out a torch burning.*

**PUC.**
==26== Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
==27== That joineth Roan unto her countrymen,
==28== But burning fatal to the Talbonites!

*Exit.*

**BAST.**
==29== See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend,
==30== The burning torch in yonder turret stands.

**CHAR.**
==31== Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
==32== A prophet to the fall of all our foes!

**REIG.**
==33== Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends,
==34== Enter and cry “The Dauphin!” presently,
==35== And then do execution on the watch.

*An alarum. Enter Talbot in an excursion.*

**TAL.**
==36== France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
==37== If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
==38== Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,
==39== Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,
==40== That hardly we escap’d the pride of France.

*Exit.*

*An alarum. Excursions. Bedford brought in sick in a chair. Enter Talbot and Burgundy without; within, Pucelle, Charles, Bastard, Alanson, and Reignier, on the walls.*

**PUC.**
==41== Good morrow, gallants, want ye corn for bread?
==42== I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
==43== Before he’ll buy again at such a rate.
==44== ’Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?

**BUR.**
==45== Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!
==46== I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own,
==47== And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.

**CHAR.**
==48== Your Grace may starve, perhaps, before that time.

**BED.**
==49== O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!

**PUC.**
==50== What will you do, good greybeard? Break a lance,
==51== And run a-tilt at Death within a chair?

**TAL.**
==52== Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,
==53== Encompass’d with thy lustful paramours!
==54== Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age,
==55== And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
==56== Damsel, I’ll have a bout with you again,
==57== Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.

**PUC.**
==58== Are ye so hot, sir? Yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace,
==59== If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.
*(They, the English, whisper together in council.)*
==60== God speed the parliament! Who shall be the speaker?

**TAL.**
==61== Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?

**PUC.**
==62== Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,
==63== To try if that our own be ours or no.

**TAL.**
==64== I speak not to that railing Hecate,
==65== But unto thee, Alanson, and the rest.
==66== Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?

**ALAN.**
==67== *Signior*, no.

**TAL.**
==68== *Signior*, hang! Base muleters of France!
==69== Like peasant footboys do they keep the walls,
==70== And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.

**PUC.**
==71== Away, captains, let’s get us from the walls,
==72== For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
==73== God buy, my lord, we came but to tell you
==74== That we are here.

*Exeunt from the walls.*

**TAL.**
==75== And there will we be too, ere it be long,
==76== Or else reproach be Talbot’s greatest fame!
==77== Vow, Burgundy, by honor of thy house,
==78== Prick’d on by public wrongs sustain’d in France,
==79== Either to get the town again, or die:
==80== And I, as sure as English Henry lives
==81== And as his father here was conqueror,
==82== As sure as in this late-betrayed town
==83== Great Coeur de Lion’s heart was buried,
==84== So sure I swear to get the town, or die.

**BUR.**
==85== My vows are equal partners with thy vows.

**TAL.**
==86== But ere we go, regard this dying prince,
==87== The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,
==88== We will bestow you in some better place,
==89== Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.

**BED.**
==90== Lord Talbot, do not so dishonor me:
==91== Here will I sit before the walls of Roan
==92== And will be partner of your weal or woe.

**BUR.**
==93== Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.

**BED.**
==94== Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
==95== That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
==96== Came to the field and vanquished his foes.
==97== Methinks I should revive the soldiers’ hearts,
==98== Because I ever found them as myself.

**TAL.**
==99== Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
==100== Then be it so. Heavens keep old Bedford safe!
==101== And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
==102== But gather we our forces out of hand,
==103== And set upon our boasting enemy.

*Exit with Burgundy and forces into the town.*

*An alarum. Excursions. Enter Sir John Falstaff and a Captain.*

**CAPT.**
==104== Whither away, Sir John Falstaff, in such haste?

**FAL.**
==105== Whither away? To save myself by flight.
==106== We are like to have the overthrow again.

**CAPT.**
==107== What? Will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?

**FAL.**
==107==                        Ay,
==108== All the Talbots in the world, to save my life.

*Exit.*

**CAPT.**
==109== Cowardly knight, ill fortune follow thee!

*Exit into the town.*

*Retreat. Excursions. Pucelle, Alanson, and Charles enter from the town and fly.*

**BED.**
==110== Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,
==111== For I have seen our enemies’ overthrow.
==112== What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
==113== They that of late were daring with their scoffs
==114== Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.

*Bedford dies, and is carried in by two in his chair.*

*An alarum. Enter Talbot, Burgundy, and the rest.*

**TAL.**
==115== Lost, and recovered in a day again!
==116== This is a double honor, Burgundy;
==117== Yet heavens have glory for this victory!

**BUR.**
==118== Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
==119== Enshrines thee in his heart, and there erects
==120== Thy noble deeds as valor’s monuments.

**TAL.**
==121== Thanks, gentle Duke. But where is Pucelle now?
==122== I think her old familiar is asleep.
==123== Now where’s the Bastard’s braves, and Charles his glikes?
==124== What, all amort? Roan hangs her head for grief
==125== That such a valiant company are fled.
==126== Now will we take some order in the town,
==127== Placing therein some expert officers,
==128== And then depart to Paris to the King,
==129== For there young Henry with his nobles lie.

**BUR.**
==130== What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.

**TAL.**
==131== But yet before we go, let’s not forget
==132== The noble Duke of Bedford late deceas’d,
==133== But see his exequies fulfill’d in Roan.
==134== A braver soldier never couched lance,
==135== A gentler heart did never sway in court;
==136== But kings and mightiest potentates must die,
==137== For that’s the end of human misery.

*Exeunt.*
