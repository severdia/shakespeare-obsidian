## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*France. Before Orléans.*

**CHAR.**
==1==Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens,
==2==So in the earth, to this day is not known.
==3==Late did he shine upon the English side;
==4==Now we are victors, upon us he smiles.
==5==What towns of any moment but we have?
==6==At pleasure here we lie near Orléans;
==7==Otherwhiles the famish’d English, like pale ghosts,
==8==Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.

**ALAN.**
==9==They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:
==10==Either they must be dieted like mules
==11==And have their provender tied to their mouths,
==12==Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.

**REIG.**
==13==Let’s raise the siege; why live we idly here?
==14==Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear;
==15==Remaineth none but mad-brain’d Salisbury,
==16==And he may well in fretting spend his gall⁠—
==17==Nor men nor money hath he to make war.

**CHAR.**
==18==Sound, sound alarum! We will rush on them.
==19==Now for the honor of the forlorn French!
==20==Him I forgive my death that killeth me,
==21==When he sees me go back one foot or fly.

*Exeunt.*

*Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English with great loss.*

*Enter Charles, Alanson, and Reignier.*

**CHAR.**
==22==Who ever saw the like? What men have I!
==23==Dogs! Cowards! Dastards! I would ne’er have fled,
==24==But that they left me midst my enemies.

**REIG.**
==25==Salisbury is a desperate homicide,
==26==He fighteth as one weary of his life.
==27==The other lords, like lions wanting food,
==28==Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.

**ALAN.**
==29==Froissard, a countryman of ours, records
==30==England all Olivers and Rolands bred
==31==During the time Edward the Third did reign.
==32==More truly now may this be verified,
==33==For none but Samsons and Goliases
==34==It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
==35==Lean raw-bon’d rascals! Who would e’er suppose
==36==They had such courage and audacity?

**CHAR.**
==37==Let’s leave this town, for they are hare-brain’d slaves,
==38==And hunger will enforce them to be more eager.
==39==Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
==40==The walls they’ll tear down than forsake the siege.

**REIG.**
==41==I think by some odd gimmors or device
==42==Their arms are set, like clocks, still to strike on;
==43==Else ne’er could they hold out so as they do.
==44==By my consent, we’ll even let them alone.

**ALAN.**
==45==Be it so.

*Enter the Bastard of Orléans.*

**BAST.**
==46==Where’s the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.

**CHAR.**
==47==Bastard of Orléans, thrice welcome to us.

**BAST.**
==48==Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appal’d.
==49==Hath the late overthrow wrought this offense?
==50==Be not dismay’d, for succor is at hand:
==51==A holy maid hither with me I bring,
==52==Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
==53==Ordained is to raise this tedious siege,
==54==And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
==55==The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
==56==Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
==57==What’s past and what’s to come she can descry.
==58==Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
==59==For they are certain and unfallible.

**CHAR.**
==60==Go call her in.
*(Exit Bastard.)*
==61==But first, to try her skill,
==62==Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place;
==63==Question her proudly, let thy looks be stern.
==64==By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.

*Enter Joan de Pucelle and Bastard.*

**REIG.**
==65==Fair maid, is’t thou wilt do these wondrous feats?

**PUC.**
==66==Reignier, is’t thou that thinkest to beguile me?
==67==Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind,
==68==I know thee well, though never seen before.
==69==Be not amaz’d, there’s nothing hid from me;
==70==In private will I talk with thee apart.
==71==Stand back, you lords, and give us leave a while.

**REIG.**
==72==She takes upon her bravely at first dash.

**PUC.**
==73==Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd’s daughter,
==74==My wit untrain’d in any kind of art.
==75==Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas’d
==76==To shine on my contemptible estate.
==77==Lo, whilest I waited on my tender lambs,
==78==And to sun’s parching heat display’d my cheeks,
==79==God’s Mother deigned to appear to me,
==80==And in a vision full of majesty
==81==Will’d me to leave my base vocation
==82==And free my country from calamity.
==83==Her aid she promis’d, and assur’d success;
==84==In complete glory she reveal’d herself;
==85==And whereas I was black and swart before,
==86==With those clear rays which she infus’d on me
==87==That beauty am I blest with which you may see.
==88==Ask me what question thou canst possible,
==89==And I will answer unpremeditated;
==90==My courage try by combat, if thou dar’st,
==91==And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
==92==Resolve on this: thou shalt be fortunate
==93==If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.

**CHAR.**
==94==Thou hast astonish’d me with thy high terms.
==95==Only this proof I’ll of thy valor make,
==96==In single combat thou shalt buckle with me;
==97==And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true,
==98==Otherwise I renounce all confidence.

**PUC.**
==99==I am prepar’d; here is my keen-edg’d sword,
==100==Deck’d with five flower-de-luces on each side,
==101==The which at Touraine, in Saint Katherine’s church-yard,
==102==Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.

**CHAR.**
==103==Then come a’ God’s name, I fear no woman.

**PUC.**
==104==And while I live, I’ll ne’er fly from a man.

*Here they fight, and Joan de Pucelle overcomes.*

**CHAR.**
==105==Stay, stay thy hands! Thou art an Amazon,
==106==And fightest with the sword of Deborah.

**PUC.**
==107==Christ’s Mother helps me, else I were too weak.

**CHAR.**
==108==Whoe’er helps thee, ’tis thou that must help me:
==109==Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
==110==My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu’d.
==111==Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
==112==Let me thy servant and not sovereign be.
==113==’Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.

**PUC.**
==114==I must not yield to any rites of love,
==115==For my profession’s sacred from above.
==116==When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
==117==Then will I think upon a recompense.

**CHAR.**
==118==Mean time look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.

**REIG.**
==119==My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.

**ALAN.**
==120==Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock,
==121==Else ne’er could he so long protract his speech.

**REIG.**
==122==Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?

**ALAN.**
==123==He may mean more than we poor men do know:
==124==These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.

**REIG.**
==125==My lord, where are you? What devise you on?
==126==Shall we give o’er Orléans, or no?

**PUC.**
==127==Why, no, I say. Distrustful recreants,
==128==Fight till the last gasp; I’ll be your guard.

**CHAR.**
==129==What she says I’ll confirm. We’ll fight it out.

**PUC.**
==130==Assign’d am I to be the English scourge.
==131==This night the siege assuredly I’ll raise:
==132==Expect Saint Martin’s summer, halcyons’ days,
==133==Since I have entered into these wars.
==134==Glory is like a circle in the water,
==135==Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself,
==136==Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
==137==With Henry’s death the English circle ends,
==138==Dispersed are the glories it included.
==139==Now am I like that proud insulting ship
==140==Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.

**CHAR.**
==141==Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
==142==Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
==143==Helen, the mother of great Constantine,
==144==Nor yet Saint Philip’s daughters, were like thee.
==145==Bright star of Venus, fall’n down on the earth,
==146==How may I reverently worship thee enough?

**ALAN.**
==147==Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.

**REIG.**
==148==Woman, do what thou canst to save our honors;
==149==Drive them from Orléans and be immortaliz’d.

**CHAR.**
==150==Presently we’ll try; come, let’s away about it.
==151==No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.

*Exeunt.*
