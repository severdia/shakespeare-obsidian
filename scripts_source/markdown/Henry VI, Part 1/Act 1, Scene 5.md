## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 1, Scene 6|Act 1, Scene 6 →]]

*France. Before Orléans.*

*Here an alarum again, and Talbot pursueth the Dauphin, and driveth him.*

*Then enter Joan De Pucelle, driving Englishmen before her, and exit after them.*

*Then enter Talbot.*

**TAL.**
==1==Where is my strength, my valor, and my force?
==2==Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them;
==3==A woman clad in armor chaseth them.
*(Enter Pucelle.)*
==4==Here, here she comes. I’ll have a bout with thee;
==5==Devil or devil’s dam, I’ll conjure thee.
==6==Blood will I draw on thee—thou art a witch⁠—
==7==And straightway give thy soul to him thou serv’st.

**PUC.**
==8==Come, come, ’tis only I that must disgrace thee.

*Here they fight.*

**TAL.**
==9==Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
==10==My breast I’ll burst with straining of my courage,
==11==And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder,
==12==But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.

**PUC.**
==13==Talbot, farewell, thy hour is not yet come.
==14==I must go victual Orléans forthwith.
*(A short alarum: then enter the town with soldiers.)*
==15==O’ertake me if thou canst, I scorn thy strength.
==16==Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men;
==17==Help Salisbury to make his testament.
==18==This day is ours, as many more shall be.

*Exit.*

**TAL.**
==19==My thoughts are whirled like a potter’s wheel,
==20==I know not where I am, nor what I do.
==21==A witch by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
==22==Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:
==23==So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
==24==Are from their hives and houses driven away.
==25==They call’d us for our fierceness English dogs,
==26==Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.
*(A short alarum.)*
==27==Hark, countrymen, either renew the fight,
==28==Or tear the lions out of England’s coat;
==29==Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions’ stead:
==30==Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
==31==Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
==32==As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.
*(Alarum. Here another skirmish.)*
==33==It will not be, retire into your trenches.
==34==You all consented unto Salisbury’s death,
==35==For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
==36==Pucelle is ent’red into Orléans
==37==In spite of us, or aught that we could do.
==38==O would I were to die with Salisbury!
==39==The shame hereof will make me hide my head.

*Exit Talbot. Alarum; retreat.*
