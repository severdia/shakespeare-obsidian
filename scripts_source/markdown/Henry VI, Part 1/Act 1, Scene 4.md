## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 1, Scene 5|Act 1, Scene 5 →]]

*France. Before Orléans.*

*Enter the Master Gunner of Orléans and his Boy.*

**M. GUN.**
==1==Sirrah, thou know’st how Orléans is besieg’d,
==2==And how the English have the suburbs won.

**M. GUN. BOY.**
==3==Father, I know, and oft have shot at them,
==4==Howe’er unfortunate I miss’d my aim.

**M. GUN.**
==5==But now thou shalt not. Be thou rul’d by me.
==6==Chief master gunner am I of this town,
==7==Something I must do to procure me grace.
==8==The Prince’s espials have informed me
==9==How the English, in the suburbs close intrench’d,
==10==Wont through a secret grate of iron bars
==11==In yonder tower to overpeer the city,
==12==And thence discover how with most advantage
==13==They may vex us with shot or with assault.
==14==To intercept this inconvenience,
==15==A piece of ord’nance ’gainst it I have plac’d,
==16==And even these three days have I watch’d
==17==If I could see them.
==18==Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.
==19==If thou spy’st any, run and bring me word,
==20==And thou shalt find me at the Governor’s.

*Exit.*

**M. GUN. BOY.**
==21==Father, I warrant you, take you no care,
==22==I’ll never trouble you, if I may spy them.

*Exit.*

*Enter Salisbury and Talbot, Sir William Glansdale, Sir Thomas Gargrave, on the turrets, with others.*

**SAL.**
==23==Talbot, my life, my joy, again return’d?
==24==How wert thou handled, being prisoner?
==25==Or by what means gots thou to be releas’d?
==26==Discourse, I prithee, on this turret’s top.

**TAL.**
==27==The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner
==28==Call’d the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles,
==29==For him was I exchang’d and ransomed.
==30==But with a baser man of arms by far
==31==Once in contempt they would have barter’d me;
==32==Which I, disdaining, scorn’d, and craved death
==33==Rather than I would be so pill’d esteem’d:
==34==In fine, redeem’d I was as I desir’d.
==35==But O, the treacherous Falstaff wounds my heart,
==36==Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
==37==If I now had him brought into my power.

**SAL.**
==38==Yet tell’st thou not how thou wert entertain’d.

**TAL.**
==39==With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
==40==In open market-place produc’d they me
==41==To be a public spectacle to all:
==42==Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
==43==The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
==44==Then broke I from the officers that led me,
==45==And with my nails digg’d stones out of the ground
==46==To hurl at the beholders of my shame.
==47==My grisly countenance made others fly,
==48==None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
==49==In iron walls they deem’d me not secure;
==50==So great fear of my name ’mongst them were spread
==51==That they suppos’d I could rend bars of steel,
==52==And spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
==53==Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had
==54==That walk’d about me every minute while;
==55==And if I did but stir out of my bed,
==56==Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

*Enter the Boy with a linstock.*

**SAL.**
==57==I grieve to hear what torments you endur’d,
==58==But we will be reveng’d sufficiently.
==59==Now it is supper-time in Orléans:
==60==Here, through this grate, I count each one,
==61==And view the Frenchmen how they fortify.
==62==Let us look in, the sight will much delight thee.
==63==Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,
==64==Let me have your express opinions,
==65==Where is best place to make our batt’ry next?

**GAR.**
==66==I think at the North Gate, for there stands lords.

**GLAN.**
==67==And I here, at the bulwark of the bridge.

**TAL.**
==68==For aught I see, this city must be famish’d,
==69==Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.

*Here they shoot, and Salisbury falls down together with Gargrave.*

**SAL.**
==70==O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!

**GAR.**
==71==O Lord, have mercy on me, woeful man!

**TAL.**
==72==What chance is this that suddenly hath cross’d us?
==73==Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst, speak.
==74==How far’st thou, mirror of all martial men?
==75==One of thy eyes and thy cheek’s side struck off!
==76==Accursed tower! Accursed fatal hand
==77==That hath contriv’d this woeful tragedy!
==78==In thirteen battles Salisbury o’ercame;
==79==Henry the Fifth he first train’d to the wars;
==80==Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,
==81==His sword did ne’er leave striking in the field.
==82==Yet liv’st thou, Salisbury? Though thy speech doth fail,
==83==One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace;
==84==The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
==85==Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
==86==If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
==87==Bear hence his body, I will help to bury it.
==88==Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
==89==Speak unto Talbot, nay, look up to him.
==90==Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
==91==Thou shalt not die whiles⁠—
==92==He beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
==93==As who should say, “When I am dead and gone,
==94==Remember to avenge me on the French.”
==95==Plantagenet, I will, and like thee, Nero,
==96==Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
==97==Wretched shall France be only in my name.
*(Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens.)*
==98==What stir is this? What tumult’s in the heavens?
==99==Whence cometh this alarum, and the noise?

*Enter a Messenger.*

**4. MESS.**
==100==My lord, my lord, the French have gather’d head.
==101==The Dauphin, with one Joan de Pucelle join’d,
==102==A holy prophetess new risen up,
==103==Is come with a great power to raise the siege.

*Here Salisbury lifteth himself up and groans.*

**TAL.**
==104==Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
==105==It irks his heart he cannot be reveng’d.
==106==Frenchmen, I’ll be a Salisbury to you.
==107==Pucelle or puzzle, dolphin or dogfish,
==108==Your hearts I’ll stamp out with my horse’s heels,
==109==And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
==110==Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
==111==And then we’ll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.

*Alarum. Exeunt bearing out the bodies.*
