## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*France. Plains in Anjou.*

*Enter Charles, Burgundy, Alanson, Bastard, Reignier, and Joan de Pucelle, with forces.*

**CHAR.**
==1==These news, my lords, may cheer our drooping spirits:
==2==’Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt,
==3==And turn again unto the warlike French.

**ALAN.**
==4==Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
==5==And keep not back your powers in dalliance.

**PUC.**
==6==Peace be amongst them if they turn to us,
==7==Else ruin combat with their palaces!

*Enter Scout.*

**SCOUT.**
==8==Success unto our valiant general,
==9==And happiness to his accomplices!

**CHAR.**
==10==What tidings send our scouts? I prithee speak.

**SCOUT.**
==11==The English army, that divided was
==12==Into two parties, is now conjoin’d in one,
==13==And means to give you battle presently.

**CHAR.**
==14==Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is,
==15==But we will presently provide for them.

**BUR.**
==16==I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there.
==17==Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.

**PUC.**
==18==Of all base passions, fear is most accurs’d.
==19==Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
==20==Let Henry fret, and all the world repine.

**CHAR.**
==21==Then on, my lords, and France be fortunate!

*Exeunt.*
