## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*France. Plains in Anjou.*

*Enter Charles, Burgundy, Alanson, Bastard, Reignier, and Joan de Pucelle, with forces.*

**CHAR.**
These news, my lords, may cheer our drooping spirits:
’Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt,
And turn again unto the warlike French.

**ALAN.**
Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.

**PUC.**
Peace be amongst them if they turn to us,
Else ruin combat with their palaces!

*Enter Scout.*

**SCOUT.**
Success unto our valiant general,
And happiness to his accomplices!

**CHAR.**
What tidings send our scouts? I prithee speak.

**SCOUT.**
The English army, that divided was
Into two parties, is now conjoin’d in one,
And means to give you battle presently.

**CHAR.**
Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is,
But we will presently provide for them.

**BUR.**
I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there.
Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.

**PUC.**
Of all base passions, fear is most accurs’d.
Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
Let Henry fret, and all the world repine.

**CHAR.**
Then on, my lords, and France be fortunate!

*Exeunt.*
