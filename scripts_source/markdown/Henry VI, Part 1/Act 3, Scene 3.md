## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*France. The plains near Rouen.*

*Enter Charles, Bastard, Alanson, Pucelle, and forces.*

**PUC.**
==1==Dismay not, princes, at this accident,
==2==Nor grieve that Roan is so recovered:
==3==Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,
==4==For things that are not to be remedied.
==5==Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while,
==6==And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
==7==We’ll pull his plumes and take away his train,
==8==If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul’d.

**CHAR.**
==9==We have been guided by thee hitherto,
==10==And of thy cunning had no diffidence;
==11==One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.

**BAST.**
==12==Search out thy wit for secret policies,
==13==And we will make thee famous through the world.

**ALAN.**
==14==We’ll set thy statue in some holy place,
==15==And have thee reverenc’d like a blessed saint.
==16==Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.

**PUC.**
==17==Then thus it must be, this doth Joan devise:
==18==By fair persuasions, mix’d with sug’red words,
==19==We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
==20==To leave the Talbot and to follow us.

**CHAR.**
==21==Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
==22==France were no place for Henry’s warriors,
==23==Nor should that nation boast it so with us,
==24==But be extirped from our provinces.

**ALAN.**
==25==Forever should they be expuls’d from France,
==26==And not have title of an earldom here.

**PUC.**
==27==Your honors shall perceive how I will work
==28==To bring this matter to the wished end.
*(Drum sounds afar off.)*
==29==Hark, by the sound of drum you may perceive
==30==Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.
*(Here sound an English march.)*
==31==There goes the Talbot, with his colors spread,
==32==And all the troops of English after him.
*(French march.)*
==33==Now in the rearward comes the Duke and his.
==34==Fortune in favor makes him lag behind.
==35==Summon a parley, we will talk with him.

*Trumpets sound a parley.*

*Enter the Duke of Burgundy and forces.*

**CHAR.**
==36==A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!

**BUR.**
==37==Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?

**PUC.**
==38==The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.

**BUR.**
==39==What say’st thou, Charles? For I am marching hence.

**CHAR.**
==40==Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.

**PUC.**
==41==Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France,
==42==Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.

**BUR.**
==43==Speak on, but be not over-tedious.

**PUC.**
==44==Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
==45==And see the cities and the towns defac’d
==46==By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
==47==As looks the mother on her lowly babe
==48==When death doth close his tender-dying eyes,
==49==See, see the pining malady of France!
==50==Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
==51==Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast.
==52==O, turn the edged sword another way,
==53==Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.
==54==One drop of blood drawn from thy country’s bosom
==55==Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore.
==56==Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
==57==And wash away thy country’s stained spots.

**BUR.**
==58==Either she hath bewitch’d me with her words,
==59==Or nature makes me suddenly relent.

**PUC.**
==60==Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
==61==Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
==62==Who join’st thou with, but with a lordly nation
==63==That will not trust thee but for profit’s sake?
==64==When Talbot hath set footing once in France
==65==And fashion’d thee that instrument of ill,
==66==Who then but English Henry will be lord,
==67==And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
==68==Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof:
==69==Was not the Duke of Orléans thy foe?
==70==And was he not in England prisoner?
==71==But when they heard he was thine enemy,
==72==They set him free without his ransom paid,
==73==In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
==74==See then, thou fight’st against thy countrymen
==75==And join’st with them will be thy slaughter-men.
==76==Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord!
==77==Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.

**BUR.**
*(Aside.)*
==78==I am vanquished. These haughty words of hers
==79==Have batt’red me like roaring cannon-shot,
==80==And made me almost yield upon my knees.⁠—
==81==Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,
==82==And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace.
==83==My forces and my power of men are yours.
==84==So farewell, Talbot, I’ll no longer trust thee.

**PUC.**
*(Aside.)*
==85==Done like a Frenchman—turn and turn again!

**CHAR.**
==86==Welcome, brave Duke, thy friendship makes us fresh.

**BAST.**
==87==And doth beget new courage in our breasts.

**ALAN.**
==88==Pucelle hath bravely play’d her part in this,
==89==And doth deserve a coronet of gold.

**CHAR.**
==90==Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,
==91==And seek how we may prejudice the foe.

*Exeunt.*
