## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]]

*London. A room in the palace.*

*Enter Suffolk in conference with the King, Gloucester, and Exeter.*

**KING.**
==1==Your wondrous rare description, noble Earl,
==2==Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish’d me.
==3==Her virtues, graced with external gifts,
==4==Do breed love’s settled passions in my heart,
==5==And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
==6==Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
==7==So am I driven by breath of her renown,
==8==Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive
==9==Where I may have fruition of her love.

**SUF.**
==10==Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
==11==Is but a preface of her worthy praise.
==12==The chief perfections of that lovely dame
==13==(Had I sufficient skill to utter them) 
==14==Would make a volume of enticing lines,
==15==Able to ravish any dull conceit;
==16==And, which is more, she is not so divine,
==17==So full replete with choice of all delights,
==18==But with as humble lowliness of mind
==19==She is content to be at your command⁠—
==20==Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
==21==To love and honor Henry as her lord.

**KING.**
==22==And otherwise will Henry ne’er presume.
==23==Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent
==24==That Marg’ret may be England’s royal queen.

**GLOU.**
==25==So should I give consent to flatter sin.
==26==You know, my lord, your Highness is betroth’d
==27==Unto another lady of esteem.
==28==How shall we then dispense with that contract,
==29==And not deface your honor with reproach?

**SUF.**
==30==As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,
==31==Or one that at a triumph, having vow’d
==32==To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
==33==By reason of his adversary’s odds.
==34==A poor earl’s daughter is unequal odds,
==35==And therefore may be broke without offense.

**GLOU.**
==36==Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
==37==Her father is no better than an earl,
==38==Although in glorious titles he excel.

**SUF.**
==39==Yes, my lord, her father is a king,
==40==The King of Naples and Jerusalem,
==41==And of such great authority in France
==42==As his alliance will confirm our peace,
==43==And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.

**GLOU.**
==44==And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
==45==Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.

**EXE.**
==46==Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
==47==Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.

**SUF.**
==48==A dow’r, my lords? Disgrace not so your king,
==49==That he should be so abject, base, and poor,
==50==To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
==51==Henry is able to enrich his queen,
==52==And not to seek a queen to make him rich:
==53==So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
==54==As market men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
==55==Marriage is a matter of more worth
==56==Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.
==57==Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,
==58==Must be companion of his nuptial bed.
==59==And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
==60==Most of all these reasons bindeth us
==61==In our opinions she should be preferr’d.
==62==For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,
==63==An age of discord and continual strife?
==64==Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
==65==And is a pattern of celestial peace.
==66==Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
==67==But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
==68==Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
==69==Approves her fit for none but for a king.
==70==Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit
==71==(More than in women commonly is seen) 
==72==Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
==73==For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
==74==Is likely to beget more conquerors,
==75==If with a lady of so high resolve
==76==(As is fair Margaret) he be link’d in love.
==77==Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me
==78==That Margaret shall be Queen, and none but she.

**KING.**
==79==Whether it be through force of your report,
==80==My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that
==81==My tender youth was never yet attaint
==82==With any passion of inflaming love,
==83==I cannot tell; but this I am assur’d,
==84==I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
==85==Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
==86==As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
==87==Take therefore shipping, post, my lord, to France,
==88==Agree to any covenants, and procure
==89==That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
==90==To cross the seas to England and be crown’d
==91==King Henry’s faithful and anointed queen.
==92==For your expenses and sufficient charge,
==93==Among the people gather up a tenth.
==94==Be gone, I say, for till you do return,
==95==I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
==96==And you, good uncle, banish all offense.
==97==If you do censure me by what you were,
==98==Not what you are, I know it will excuse
==99==This sudden execution of my will.
==100==And so conduct me where, from company,
==101==I may revolve and ruminate my grief.

*Exit.*

**GLOU.**
==102==Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.

*Exit Gloucester with Exeter.*

**SUF.**
==103==Thus Suffolk hath prevail’d, and thus he goes,
==104==As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,
==105==With hope to find the like event in love,
==106==But prosper better than the Troyan did.
==107==Margaret shall now be Queen, and rule the King;
==108==But I will rule both her, the King, and realm.

*Exit.*
