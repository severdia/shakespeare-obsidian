## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Paris. A room in the palace.*

*Enter the King, Gloucester, Winchester, Richard Plantagenet, now Duke of York, Suffolk, Somerset, Warwick, Exeter, Vernon, Basset, and others. To them, with his Soldiers, Talbot.*

**TAL.**
==1==My gracious prince, and honorable peers,
==2==Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
==3==I have a while given truce unto my wars,
==4==To do my duty to my sovereign;
==5==In sign whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim’d
==6==To your obedience fifty fortresses,
==7==Twelve cities, and seven walled towns of strength,
==8==Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,
==9==Lets fall his sword before your Highness’ feet,
==10==And with submissive loyalty of heart
==11==Ascribes the glory of his conquest got
==12==First to my God and next unto your Grace.

*Kneels.*

**KING.**
==13==Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,
==14==That hath so long been resident in France?

**GLOU.**
==15==Yes, if it please your Majesty, my liege.

**KING.**
==16==Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!
==17==When I was young (as yet I am not old),
==18==I do remember how my father said
==19==A stouter champion never handled sword.
==20==Long since we were resolved of your truth,
==21==Your faithful service, and your toil in war;
==22==Yet never have you tasted our reward,
==23==Or been reguerdon’d with so much as thanks,
==24==Because till now we never saw your face.
==25==Therefore stand up, and for these good deserts
==26==We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury,
==27==And in our coronation take your place.

*Sennet. Flourish.*

*Exeunt. Manent Vernon and Basset.*

**VER.**
==28==Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,
==29==Disgracing of these colors that I wear
==30==In honor of my noble Lord of York,
==31==Dar’st thou maintain the former words thou spak’st?

**BAS.**
==32==Yes, sir, as well as you dare patronage
==33==The envious barking of your saucy tongue
==34==Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.

**VER.**
==35==Sirrah, thy lord I honor as he is.

**BAS.**
==36==Why, what is he? As good a man as York.

**VER.**
==37==Hark ye; not so; in witness, take ye that.

*Strikes him.*

**BAS.**
==38==Villain, thou knowest the law of arms is such
==39==That whoso draws a sword, ’tis present death,
==40==Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
==41==But I’ll unto his Majesty, and crave
==42==I may have liberty to venge this wrong,
==43==When thou shalt see I’ll meet thee to thy cost.

**VER.**
==44==Well, miscreant, I’ll be there as soon as you,
==45==And after meet you, sooner than you would.

*Exeunt.*
