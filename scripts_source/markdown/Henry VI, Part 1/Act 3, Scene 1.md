## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*London. The Parliament House.*

*Flourish. Enter King, Exeter, Gloucester, Winchester, Warwick, Somerset, Suffolk, Richard Plantagenet, and others.*

*Gloucester offers to put up a bill; Winchester snatches it, tears it.*

**WIN.**
==1==Com’st thou with deep premeditated lines,
==2==With written pamphlets studiously devis’d?
==3==Humphrey of Gloucester, if thou canst accuse,
==4==Or aught intend’st to lay unto my charge,
==5==Do it without invention, suddenly,
==6==As I with sudden and extemporal speech
==7==Purpose to answer what thou canst object.

**GLOU.**
==8==Presumptuous priest, this place commands my patience,
==9==Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonor’d me.
==10==Think not, although in writing I preferr’d
==11==The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,
==12==That therefore I have forg’d, or am not able
==13==Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen.
==14==No, prelate, such is thy audacious wickedness,
==15==Thy lewd, pestiferous, and dissentious pranks,
==16==As very infants prattle of thy pride.
==17==Thou art a most pernicious usurer,
==18==Froward by nature, enemy to peace,
==19==Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems
==20==A man of thy profession and degree;
==21==And for thy treachery, what’s more manifest?
==22==In that thou laidst a trap to take my life,
==23==As well at London Bridge as at the Tower.
==24==Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
==25==The King, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
==26==From envious malice of thy swelling heart.

**WIN.**
==27==Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe
==28==To give me hearing what I shall reply.
==29==If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse,
==30==As he will have me, how am I so poor?
==31==Or how haps it I seek not to advance
==32==Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
==33==And for dissension, who preferreth peace
==34==More than I do, except I be provok’d?
==35==No, my good lords, it is not that offends,
==36==It is not that that hath incens’d the Duke:
==37==It is because no one should sway but he,
==38==No one, but he, should be about the King;
==39==And that engenders thunder in his breast,
==40==And makes him roar these accusations forth.
==41==But he shall know I am as good⁠—

**GLOU.**
==41==                  As good?
==42==Thou bastard of my grandfather!

**WIN.**
==43==Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
==44==But one imperious in another’s throne?

**GLOU.**
==45==Am I not Protector, saucy priest?

**WIN.**
==46==And am not I a prelate of the Church?

**GLOU.**
==47==Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
==48==And useth it to patronage his theft.

**WIN.**
==49==Unreverent Gloucester!

**GLOU.**
==49==              Thou art reverent
==50==Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.

**WIN.**
==51==Rome shall remedy this.

**GLOU.**
==51==              Roam thither then.

**WAR.**
*(To Winchester)*
==52==My lord, it were your duty to forbear.

**SOM.**
==53==Ay, so the Bishop be not overborne.
==54==Methinks my lord should be religious,
==55==And know the office that belongs to such.

**WAR.**
==56==Methinks his lordship should be humbler,
==57==It fitteth not a prelate so to plead.

**SOM.**
==58==Yes, when his holy state is touch’d so near.

**WAR.**
==59==State holy or unhallow’d, what of that?
==60==Is not his Grace Protector to the King?

**PLAN.**
*(Aside.)*
==61==Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,
==62==Lest it be said, “Speak, sirrah, when you should;
==63==Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?”
==64==Else would I have a fling at Winchester.

**KING.**
==65==Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,
==66==The special watchmen of our English weal,
==67==I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,
==68==To join your hearts in love and amity.
==69==O, what a scandal is it to our crown
==70==That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
==71==Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell,
==72==Civil dissension is a viperous worm
==73==That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
*(A noise within.)*
==74==“Down with the tawny-coats!”
==75==What tumult’s this?

**WAR.**
==75==           An uproar, I dare warrant,
==76==Begun through malice of the Bishop’s men.
*(A noise again.)*
==76==                       “Stones! Stones!”

*Enter Mayor of London, attended.*

**MAY.**
==77==O my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
==78==Pity the city of London, pity us!
==79==The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester’s men,
==80==Forbidden late to carry any weapon,
==81==Have fill’d their pockets full of pebble stones;
==82==And, banding themselves in contrary parts,
==83==Do pelt so fast at one another’s pate
==84==That many have their giddy brains knock’d out;
==85==Our windows are broke down in every street,
==86==And we, for fear, compell’d to shut our shops.

*Enter Servingmen of both parties, in skirmish, with bloody pates.*

**KING.**
==87==We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,
==88==To hold your slaught’ring hands and keep the peace.
==89==Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.

**WIN. SERV. ATT.**
==90==Nay, if we be forbidden stones, we’ll fall to it with our teeth.

**1. GLOU. SERV. ATT.**
==91==Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.

*Skirmish again.*

**GLOU.**
==92==You of my household, leave this peevish broil,
==93==And set this unaccustom’d fight aside.

**2. GLOU. SERV. ATT.**
==94==My lord, we know your Grace to be a man
==95==Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,
==96==Inferior to none but to his Majesty;
==97==And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
==98==So kind a father of the commonweal,
==99==To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
==100==We and our wives and children all will fight,
==101==And have our bodies slaught’red by thy foes.

**WIN. SERV. ATT.**
==102==Ay, and the very parings of our nails
==103==Shall pitch a field when we are dead.

*Begin again.*

**GLOU.**
==103==                     Stay, stay, I say!
==104==And if you love me, as you say you do,
==105==Let me persuade you to forbear a while.

**KING.**
==106==O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!
==107==Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold
==108==My sighs and tears, and will not once relent?
==109==Who should be pitiful, if you be not?
==110==Or who should study to prefer a peace,
==111==If holy churchmen take delight in broils?

**WAR.**
==112==Yield, my Lord Protector, yield, Winchester,
==113==Except you mean with obstinate repulse
==114==To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
==115==You see what mischief, and what murder too,
==116==Hath been enacted through your enmity.
==117==Then be at peace, except ye thirst for blood.

**WIN.**
==118==He shall submit, or I will never yield.

**GLOU.**
==119==Compassion on the King commands me stoop,
==120==Or I would see his heart out ere the priest
==121==Should ever get that privilege of me.

**WAR.**
==122==Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the Duke
==123==Hath banish’d moody discontented fury,
==124==As by his smoothed brows it doth appear.
==125==Why look you still so stern and tragical?

**GLOU.**
==126==Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.

**KING.**
==127==Fie, uncle Beauford, I have heard you preach
==128==That malice was a great and grievous sin;
==129==And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
==130==But prove a chief offender in the same?

**WAR.**
==131==Sweet King! The Bishop hath a kindly gird.
==132==For shame, my Lord of Winchester, relent!
==133==What, shall a child instruct you what to do?

**WIN.**
==134==Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;
==135==Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside.)*
==136==Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.⁠—
==137==See here, my friends and loving countrymen,
==138==This token serveth for a flag of truce
==139==Betwixt ourselves and all our followers.
==140==So help me God, as I dissemble not!

**WIN.**
*(Aside.)*
==141==So help me God, as I intend it not!

**KING.**
==142==O loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,
==143==How joyful am I made by this contract!
==144==Away, my masters, trouble us no more,
==145==But join in friendship, as your lords have done.

**WIN. SERV. ATT.**
==146==Content, I’ll to the surgeon’s.

**1. GLOU. SERV. ATT.**
==146==                And so will I.

**2. GLOU. SERV. ATT.**
==147==And I will see what physic the tavern affords.

*Exeunt Servingmen, Mayor, etc.*

**WAR.**
==148==Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,
==149==Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
==150==We do exhibit to your Majesty.

**GLOU.**
==151==Well urg’d, my Lord of Warwick; for, sweet prince,
==152==And if your Grace mark every circumstance,
==153==You have great reason to do Richard right,
==154==Especially for those occasions
==155==At Eltam Place I told your Majesty.

**KING.**
==156==And those occasions, uncle, were of force:
==157==Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is
==158==That Richard be restored to his blood.

**WAR.**
==159==Let Richard be restored to his blood,
==160==So shall his father’s wrongs be recompens’d.

**WIN.**
==161==As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.

**KING.**
==162==If Richard will be true, not that alone
==163==But all the whole inheritance I give
==164==That doth belong unto the house of York,
==165==From whence you spring by lineal descent.

**PLAN.**
==166==Thy humble servant vows obedience
==167==And humble service till the point of death.

**KING.**
==168==Stoop then and set your knee against my foot,
==169==And in reguerdon of that duty done,
==170==I girt thee with the valiant sword of York:
==171==Rise, Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
==172==And rise created princely Duke of York.

**PLAN.**
==173==And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
==174==And as my duty springs, so perish they
==175==That grudge one thought against your Majesty!

**ALL.**
==176==Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!

**SOM.**
*(Aside.)*
==177==Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!

**GLOU.**
==178==Now will it best avail your Majesty
==179==To cross the seas and to be crown’d in France.
==180==The presence of a king engenders love
==181==Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
==182==As it disanimates his enemies.

**KING.**
==183==When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes,
==184==For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.

**GLOU.**
==185==Your ships already are in readiness.

*Sennet. Flourish.*

*Exeunt. Manet Exeter.*

**EXE.**
==186==Ay, we may march in England, or in France,
==187==Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
==188==This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
==189==Burns under feigned ashes of forg’d love,
==190==And will at last break out into a flame:
==191==As fest’red members rot but by degree,
==192==Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
==193==So will this base and envious discord breed.
==194==And now I fear that fatal prophecy
==195==Which in the time of Henry nam’d the Fifth
==196==Was in the mouth of every sucking babe,
==197==That Henry born at Monmouth should win all,
==198==And Henry born at Windsor lose all:
==199==Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
==200==His days may finish ere that hapless time.

*Exit.*
