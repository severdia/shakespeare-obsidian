## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*London. A room in the Tower of London.*

*Enter Mortimer, brought in a chair, and Keepers.*

**MORT.**
==1==Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
==2==Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
==3==Even like a man new haled from the rack,
==4==So fare my limbs with long imprisonment;
==5==And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
==6==Nestor-like aged, in an age of care,
==7==Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
==8==These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
==9==Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
==10==Weak shoulders, overborne with burdening grief,
==11==And pithless arms, like to a withered vine
==12==That droops his sapless branches to the ground.
==13==Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb
==14==(Unable to support this lump of clay),
==15==Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
==16==As witting I no other comfort have.
==17==But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?

**1. KEEPER.**
==18==Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come.
==19==We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber,
==20==And answer was return’d that he will come.

**MORT.**
==21==Enough; my soul shall then be satisfied.
==22==Poor gentleman, his wrong doth equal mine.
==23==Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
==24==Before whose glory I was great in arms,
==25==This loathsome sequestration have I had;
==26==And even since then hath Richard been obscur’d,
==27==Depriv’d of honor and inheritance.
==28==But now, the arbitrator of despairs,
==29==Just Death, kind umpire of men’s miseries,
==30==With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence.
==31==I would his troubles likewise were expir’d,
==32==That so he might recover what was lost.

*Enter Richard Plantagenet.*

**1. KEEPER.**
==33==My lord, your loving nephew now is come.

**MORT.**
==34==Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?

**PLAN.**
==35==Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly us’d,
==36==Your nephew, late-despised Richard, comes.

**MORT.**
==37==Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
==38==And in his bosom spend my latter gasp.
==39==O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
==40==That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
==41==And now declare, sweet stem from York’s great stock,
==42==Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despis’d?

**PLAN.**
==43==First, lean thine aged back against mine arm,
==44==And in that ease, I’ll tell thee my disease.
==45==This day, in argument upon a case,
==46==Some words there grew ’twixt Somerset and me;
==47==Among which terms he us’d his lavish tongue
==48==And did upbraid me with my father’s death;
==49==Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
==50==Else with the like I had requited him.
==51==Therefore, good uncle, for my father’s sake,
==52==In honor of a true Plantagenet,
==53==And for alliance sake, declare the cause
==54==My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.

**MORT.**
==55==That cause, fair nephew, that imprison’d me
==56==And hath detain’d me all my flow’ring youth
==57==Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
==58==Was cursed instrument of his decease.

**PLAN.**
==59==Discover more at large what cause that was,
==60==For I am ignorant and cannot guess.

**MORT.**
==61==I will, if that my fading breath permit
==62==And death approach not ere my tale be done.
==63==Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
==64==Depos’d his nephew Richard, Edward’s son,
==65==The first begotten, and the lawful heir
==66==Of Edward king, the third of that descent;
==67==During whose reign the Percies of the north,
==68==Finding his usurpation most unjust,
==69==Endeavor’d my advancement to the throne.
==70==The reason mov’d these warlike lords to this
==71==Was, for that (young Richard thus remov’d,
==72==Leaving no heir begotten of his body) 
==73==I was the next by birth and parentage;
==74==For by my mother I derived am
==75==From Lionel Duke of Clarence, third son
==76==To King Edward the Third; whereas he
==77==From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
==78==Being but fourth of that heroic line.
==79==But mark: as in this haughty great attempt
==80==They labored to plant the rightful heir,
==81==I lost my liberty, and they their lives.
==82==Long after this, when Henry the Fifth
==83==(Succeeding his father Bullingbrook) did reign,
==84==Thy father, Earl of Cambridge then, deriv’d
==85==From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
==86==Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
==87==Again, in pity of my hard distress,
==88==Levied an army, weening to redeem
==89==And have install’d me in the diadem.
==90==But as the rest, so fell that noble earl,
==91==And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
==92==In whom the title rested, were suppress’d.

**PLAN.**
==93==Of which, my lord, your honor is the last.

**MORT.**
==94==True; and thou seest that I no issue have,
==95==And that my fainting words do warrant death.
==96==Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather;
==97==But yet be wary in thy studious care.

**PLAN.**
==98==Thy grave admonishments prevail with me.
==99==But yet methinks, my father’s execution
==100==Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.

**MORT.**
==101==With silence, nephew, be thou politic.
==102==Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster,
==103==And like a mountain, not to be remov’d.
==104==But now thy uncle is removing hence,
==105==As princes do their courts, when they are cloy’d
==106==With long continuance in a settled place.

**PLAN.**
==107==O uncle, would some part of my young years
==108==Might but redeem the passage of your age!

**MORT.**
==109==Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth
==110==Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
==111==Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good,
==112==Only give order for my funeral.
==113==And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes,
==114==And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!

*Dies.*

**PLAN.**
==115==And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!
==116==In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage,
==117==And like a hermit overpass’d thy days.
==118==Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast,
==119==And what I do imagine, let that rest.
==120==Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
==121==Will see his burial better than his life.
*(Exeunt Keepers, bearing out the body of Mortimer.)*
==122==Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,
==123==Chok’d with ambition of the meaner sort;
==124==And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
==125==Which Somerset hath offer’d to my house,
==126==I doubt not but with honor to redress.
==127==And therefore haste I to the parliament,
==128==Either to be restored to my blood,
==129==Or make my will th’ advantage of my good.

*Exit.*
