## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 7|Act 4, Scene 7 →]]

*A field of battle.*

*Alarum. Excursions, wherein Talbot’s son, John, is hemm’d about, and Talbot rescues him.*

**TAL.**
==1==Saint George and victory! Fight, soldiers, fight!
==2==The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word,
==3==And left us to the rage of France his sword.
==4==Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;
==5==I gave thee life, and rescu’d thee from death.

**JOHN.**
==6==O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
==7==The life thou gav’st me first was lost and done,
==8==Till with thy warlike sword, despite of fate,
==9==To my determin’d time thou gav’st new date.

**TAL.**
==10==When from the Dauphin’s crest thy sword struck fire,
==11==It warm’d thy father’s heart with proud desire
==12==Of bold-fac’d victory. Then leaden age,
==13==Quicken’d with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
==14==Beat down Alanson, Orléans, Burgundy,
==15==And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
==16==The ireful Bastard Orléans, that drew blood
==17==From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
==18==Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,
==19==And interchanging blows I quickly shed
==20==Some of his bastard blood, and in disgrace
==21==Bespoke him thus: “Contaminated, base,
==22==And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
==23==Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
==24==Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy.”
==25==Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
==26==Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father’s care:
==27==Art thou not weary, John? How dost thou fare?
==28==Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
==29==Now thou art seal’d the son of chivalry?
==30==Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead;
==31==The help of one stands me in little stead.
==32==O, too much folly is it, well I wot,
==33==To hazard all our lives in one small boat!
==34==If I today die not with Frenchmen’s rage,
==35==Tomorrow I shall die with mickle age.
==36==By me they nothing gain and if I stay,
==37==’Tis but the short’ning of my life one day.
==38==In thee thy mother dies, our household’s name,
==39==My death’s revenge, thy youth, and England’s fame:
==40==All these, and more, we hazard by thy stay;
==41==All these are sav’d if thou wilt fly away.

**JOHN.**
==42==The sword of Orléans hath not made me smart;
==43==These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart.
==44==On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
==45==To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
==46==Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly
==47==The coward horse that bears me fall and die!
==48==And like me to the peasant boys of France,
==49==To be shame’s scorn and subject of mischance!
==50==Surely, by all the glory you have won,
==51==And if I fly, I am not Talbot’s son.
==52==Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;
==53==If son to Talbot, die at Talbot’s foot.

**TAL.**
==54==Then follow thou thy desp’rate sire of Crete,
==55==Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet.
==56==If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father’s side,
==57==And commendable prov’d, let’s die in pride.

*Exeunt.*
