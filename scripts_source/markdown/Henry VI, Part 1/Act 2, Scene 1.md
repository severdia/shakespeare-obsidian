## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 6|← Act 1, Scene 6]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*France. Before Orléans.*

*Enter a French Sergeant of a band, with two Sentinels.*

**FR. SERG.**
==1==Sirs, take your places and be vigilant.
==2==If any noise or soldier you perceive
==3==Near to the walls, by some apparent sign
==4==Let us have knowledge at the court of guard.

**1. SENT.**
==5==Sergeant, you shall.
*(Exit Sergeant.)*
==5==           Thus are poor servitors,
==6==When others sleep upon their quiet beds,
==7==Constrain’d to watch in darkness, rain, and cold.

*Enter Talbot, Bedford, and Burgundy, and forces with scaling-ladders.*

**TAL.**
==8==Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,
==9==By whose approach the regions of Artois,
==10==Wallon, and Picardy are friends to us,
==11==This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,
==12==Having all day carous’d and banqueted:
==13==Embrace we then this opportunity
==14==As fitting best to quittance their deceit
==15==Contriv’d by art and baleful sorcery.

**BED.**
==16==Coward of France, how much he wrongs his fame,
==17==Despairing of his own arm’s fortitude,
==18==To join with witches and the help of hell!

**BUR.**
==19==Traitors have never other company.
==20==But what’s that Pucelle whom they term so pure?

**TAL.**
==21==A maid, they say.

**BED.**
==21==           A maid? And be so martial?

**BUR.**
==22==Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,
==23==If underneath the standard of the French
==24==She carry armor as she hath begun.

**TAL.**
==25==Well, let them practice and converse with spirits.
==26==God is our fortress, in whose conquering name
==27==Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.

**BED.**
==28==Ascend, brave Talbot, we will follow thee.

**TAL.**
==29==Not all together. Better far, I guess,
==30==That we do make our entrance several ways;
==31==That, if it chance the one of us do fail,
==32==The other yet may rise against their force.

**BED.**
==33==Agreed. I’ll to yond corner.

**BUR.**
==33==                And I to this.

**TAL.**
==34==And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.
==35==Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right
==36==Of English Henry, shall this night appear
==37==How much in duty I am bound to both.

*Cry: “Saint George!” “A Talbot!” *

*The English scale the walls.*

**1. SENT.**
==38==Arm, arm! The enemy doth make assault!

*The French leap o’er the walls in their shirts. Enter, several ways, Bastard, Alanson, Reignier, half ready and half unready.*

**ALAN.**
==39==How now, my lords? What, all unready so?

**BAST.**
==40==Unready? Ay, and glad we scap’d so well.

**REIG.**
==41==’Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,
==42==Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.

**ALAN.**
==43==Of all exploits since first I follow’d arms,
==44==Ne’er heard I of a warlike enterprise
==45==More venturous or desperate than this.

**BAST.**
==46==I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.

**REIG.**
==47==If not of hell, the heavens sure favor him.

**ALAN.**
==48==Here cometh Charles, I marvel how he sped.

*Enter Charles and Joan de Pucelle.*

**BAST.**
==49==Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.

**CHAR.**
==50==Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
==51==Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,
==52==Make us partakers of a little gain,
==53==That now our loss might be ten times so much?

**PUC.**
==54==Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend?
==55==At all times will you have my power alike?
==56==Sleeping or waking, must I still prevail,
==57==Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
==58==Improvident soldiers, had your watch been good,
==59==This sudden mischief never could have fall’n.

**CHAR.**
==60==Duke of Alanson, this was your default,
==61==That, being captain of the watch tonight,
==62==Did look no better to that weighty charge.

**ALAN.**
==63==Had all your quarters been as safely kept
==64==As that whereof I had the government,
==65==We had not been thus shamefully surpris’d.

**BAST.**
==66==Mine was secure.

**REIG.**
==66==           And so was mine, my lord.

**CHAR.**
==67==And for myself, most part of all this night,
==68==Within her quarter and mine own precinct
==69==I was employ’d in passing to and fro,
==70==About relieving of the sentinels.
==71==Then how, or which way, should they first break in?

**PUC.**
==72==Question, my lords, no further of the case,
==73==How or which way. ’Tis sure they found some place
==74==But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
==75==And now there rests no other shift but this,
==76==To gather our soldiers, scatter’d and dispers’d,
==77==And lay new platforms to endamage them.

*Alarum. Enter an English Soldier crying, “A Talbot! A Talbot!”*

*They fly, leaving their clothes behind.*

**ENG. SOLD.**
==78==I’ll be so bold to take what they have left.
==79==The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword,
==80==For I have loaden me with many spoils,
==81==Using no other weapon but his name.

*Exit.*
