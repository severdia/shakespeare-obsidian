## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*France. Before Bourdeaux.*

*Enter Talbot with Trump and Drum before Bordeaux.*

**TAL.**
==1==Go to the gates of Bordeaux, trumpeter,
==2==Summon their general unto the wall.
*(Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others aloft.)*
==3==English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
==4==Servant in arms to Harry King of England,
==5==And thus he would: Open your city-gates,
==6==Be humble to us, call my sovereign yours,
==7==And do him homage as obedient subjects,
==8==And I’ll withdraw me and my bloody power.
==9==But if you frown upon this proffer’d peace,
==10==You tempt the fury of my three attendants,
==11==Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire,
==12==Who in a moment even with the earth
==13==Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,
==14==If you forsake the offer of their love.

**GEN.**
==15==Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,
==16==Our nation’s terror and their bloody scourge!
==17==The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
==18==On us thou canst not enter but by death;
==19==For I protest we are well fortified,
==20==And strong enough to issue out and fight.
==21==If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,
==22==Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee.
==23==On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch’d,
==24==To wall thee from the liberty of flight;
==25==And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,
==26==But death doth front thee with apparent spoil,
==27==And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
==28==Ten thousand French have ta’en the sacrament
==29==To rive their dangerous artillery
==30==Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.
==31==Lo, there thou stand’st, a breathing valiant man,
==32==Of an invincible unconquer’d spirit!
==33==This is the latest glory of thy praise
==34==That I thy enemy due thee withal;
==35==For ere the glass, that now begins to run,
==36==Finish the process of his sandy hour,
==37==These eyes, that see thee now well colored,
==38==Shall see thee withered, bloody, pale, and dead.
*(Drum afar off.)*
==39==Hark, hark, the Dauphin’s drum, a warning bell,
==40==Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul,
==41==And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.

*Exit with others above.*

**TAL.**
==42==He fables not, I hear the enemy.
==43==Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
==44==O negligent and heedless discipline!
==45==How are we park’d and bounded in a pale,
==46==A little herd of England’s timorous deer,
==47==Maz’d with a yelping kennel of French curs!
==48==If we be English deer, be then in blood,
==49==Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,
==50==But rather, moody-mad; and, desperate stags,
==51==Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel,
==52==And make the cowards stand aloof at bay.
==53==Sell every man his life as dear as mine,
==54==And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.
==55==God and Saint George, Talbot and England’s right,
==56==Prosper our colors in this dangerous fight!

*Exeunt.*
