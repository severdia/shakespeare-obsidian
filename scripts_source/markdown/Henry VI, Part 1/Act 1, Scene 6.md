## Act 1, Scene 6
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*France. Before Orléans.*

*Flourish. Enter on the walls Pucelle, Charles the Dauphin, Reignier, Alanson, and Soldiers.*

**PUC.**
Advance our waving colors on the walls,
Rescu’d is Orléans from the English!
Thus Joan de Pucelle hath perform’d her word.

**CHAR.**
Divinest creature, Astraea’s daughter,
How shall I honor thee for this success?
Thy promises are like Adonis’ garden,
That one day bloom’d and fruitful were the next.
France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!
Recover’d is the town of Orléans.
More blessed hap did ne’er befall our state.

**REIG.**
Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?
Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires,
And feast and banquet in the open streets,
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.

**ALAN.**
All France will be replete with mirth and joy,
When they shall hear how we have play’d the men.

**CHAR.**
’Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;
For which I will divide my crown with her,
And all the priests and friars in my realm
Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
A statelier pyramis to her I’ll rear
Than Rhodope’s of Memphis ever was.
In memory of her when she is dead,
Her ashes, in an urn more precious
Than the rich-jewell’d coffer of Darius,
Transported shall be at high festivals
Before the kings and queens of France.
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
But Joan de Pucelle shall be France’s saint.
Come in, and let us banquet royally,
After this golden day of victory.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
