## Act 1, Scene 6
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*France. Before Orléans.*

*Flourish. Enter on the walls Pucelle, Charles the Dauphin, Reignier, Alanson, and Soldiers.*

**PUC.**
==1==Advance our waving colors on the walls,
==2==Rescu’d is Orléans from the English!
==3==Thus Joan de Pucelle hath perform’d her word.

**CHAR.**
==4==Divinest creature, Astraea’s daughter,
==5==How shall I honor thee for this success?
==6==Thy promises are like Adonis’ garden,
==7==That one day bloom’d and fruitful were the next.
==8==France, triumph in thy glorious prophetess!
==9==Recover’d is the town of Orléans.
==10==More blessed hap did ne’er befall our state.

**REIG.**
==11==Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?
==12==Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires,
==13==And feast and banquet in the open streets,
==14==To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.

**ALAN.**
==15==All France will be replete with mirth and joy,
==16==When they shall hear how we have play’d the men.

**CHAR.**
==17==’Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;
==18==For which I will divide my crown with her,
==19==And all the priests and friars in my realm
==20==Shall in procession sing her endless praise.
==21==A statelier pyramis to her I’ll rear
==22==Than Rhodope’s of Memphis ever was.
==23==In memory of her when she is dead,
==24==Her ashes, in an urn more precious
==25==Than the rich-jewell’d coffer of Darius,
==26==Transported shall be at high festivals
==27==Before the kings and queens of France.
==28==No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,
==29==But Joan de Pucelle shall be France’s saint.
==30==Come in, and let us banquet royally,
==31==After this golden day of victory.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
