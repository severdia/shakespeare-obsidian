## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*France. Plains in Gascony.*

*Enter a Messenger that meets York. Enter York with Trumpet and many Soldiers.*

**YORK.**
==1== Are not the speedy scouts return’d again
==2== That dogg’d the mighty army of the Dauphin?

**5. MESS.**
==3== They are return’d, my lord, and give it out
==4== That he is march’d to Bordeaux with his power
==5== To fight with Talbot. As he march’d along,
==6== By your espials were discovered
==7== Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,
==8== Which join’d with him and made their march for Bordeaux.

*Exit.*

**YORK.**
==9== A plague upon that villain Somerset,
==10== That thus delays my promised supply
==11== Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!
==12== Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid,
==13== And I am louted by a traitor villain
==14== And cannot help the noble chevalier.
==15== God comfort him in this necessity!
==16== If he miscarry, farewell wars in France!

*Enter another Messenger, Sir William Lucy.*

**LUCY.**
==17== Thou princely leader of our English strength,
==18== Never so needful on the earth of France,
==19== Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,
==20== Who now is girdled with a waist of iron
==21== And hemm’d about with grim destruction.
==22== To Bordeaux, warlike Duke! To Bordeaux, York!
==23== Else farewell Talbot, France, and England’s honor!

**YORK.**
==24== O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart
==25== Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot’s place!
==26== So should we save a valiant gentleman
==27== By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.
==28== Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,
==29== That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.

**LUCY.**
==30== O, send some succor to the distress’d lord!

**YORK.**
==31== He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
==32== We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;
==33== All long of this vile traitor Somerset.

**LUCY.**
==34== Then God take mercy on brave Talbot’s soul,
==35== And on his son young John, who two hours since
==36== I met in travel toward his warlike father!
==37== This seven years did not Talbot see his son,
==38== And now they meet where both their lives are done.

**YORK.**
==39== Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have
==40== To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
==41== Away! Vexation almost stops my breath,
==42== That sund’red friends greet in the hour of death.
==43== Lucy, farewell, no more my fortune can,
==44== But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.
==45== Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,
==46== Long all of Somerset and his delay.

*Exit with his Soldiers.*

**LUCY.**
==47== Thus while the vulture of sedition
==48== Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders,
==49== Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss
==50== The conquest of our scarce-cold conqueror,
==51== That ever-living man of memory,
==52== Henry the Fifth. Whiles they each other cross,
==53== Lives, honors, lands, and all, hurry to loss.

*Exit Sir William Lucy*
