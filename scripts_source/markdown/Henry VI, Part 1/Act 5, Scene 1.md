## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 7|← Act 4, Scene 7]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*London. A room in the palace.*

*Sennet. Enter King, Gloucester, and Exeter.*

**KING.**
==1== Have you perus’d the letters from the Pope,
==2== The Emperor, and the Earl of Armagnac?

**GLOU.**
==3== I have, my lord, and their intent is this:
==4== They humbly sue unto your Excellence
==5== To have a godly peace concluded of
==6== Between the realms of England and of France.

**KING.**
==7== How doth your Grace affect their motion?

**GLOU.**
==8== Well, my good lord, and as the only means
==9== To stop effusion of our Christian blood,
==10== And stablish quietness on every side.

**KING.**
==11== Ay, marry, uncle, for I always thought
==12== It was both impious and unnatural
==13== That such immanity and bloody strife
==14== Should reign among professors of one faith.

**GLOU.**
==15== Beside, my lord, the sooner to effect
==16== And surer bind this knot of amity,
==17== The Earl of Armagnac, near knit to Charles,
==18== A man of great authority in France,
==19== Proffers his only daughter to your Grace
==20== In marriage, with a large and sumptuous dowry.

**KING.**
==21== Marriage, uncle? Alas, my years are young;
==22== And fitter is my study and my books
==23== Than wanton dalliance with a paramour.
==24== Yet call th’ ambassadors, and as you please,
==25== So let them have their answers every one.
==26== I shall be well content with any choice
==27== Tends to God’s glory and my country’s weal.

*Enter Winchester in cardinal’s habit and three Ambassadors, one of them a Papal Legate.*

**EXE.**
==28== What, is my Lord of Winchester install’d,
==29== And call’d unto a cardinal’s degree?
==30== Then I perceive that will be verified
==31== Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy:
==32== “If once he come to be a cardinal,
==33== He’ll make his cap co-equal with the crown.”

**KING.**
==34== My lords ambassadors, your several suits
==35== Have been consider’d and debated on.
==36== Your purpose is both good and reasonable;
==37== And therefore are we certainly resolv’d
==38== To draw conditions of a friendly peace,
==39== Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean
==40== Shall be transported presently to France.

**GLOU.**
*(To the Ambassador from Armagnac.)*
==41== And for the proffer of my lord your master,
==42== I have inform’d his Highness so at large,
==43== As liking of the lady’s virtuous gifts,
==44== Her beauty, and the value of her dower,
==45== He doth intend she shall be England’s queen.

**KING.**
==46== In argument and proof of which contract,
==47== Bear her this jewel, pledge of my affection.
==48== And so, my Lord Protector, see them guarded
==49== And safely brought to Dover, wherein shipp’d,
==50== Commit them to the fortune of the sea.

*Exeunt all but Winchester and Legate.*

**WIN.**
==51== Stay, my lord legate, you shall first receive
==52== The sum of money which I promised
==53== Should be delivered to his Holiness
==54== For clothing me in these grave ornaments.

**PAP.**
==55== I will attend upon your lordship’s leisure.

*Exit.*

**WIN.**
==56== Now Winchester will not submit, I trow,
==57== Or be inferior to the proudest peer.
==58== Humphrey of Gloucester, thou shalt well perceive
==59== That neither in birth, or for authority,
==60== The Bishop will be overborne by thee.
==61== I’ll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee,
==62== Or sack this country with a mutiny.

*Exit.*
