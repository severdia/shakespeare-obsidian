## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*London. Gloucester’s Garden.*

*Enter the witch, Margery Jourdain, the two priests—Hume and Southwell—and Bolingbrook.*

**HUME.**
==1==Come, my masters, the Duchess, I tell you, expects performance of your promises.

**BOLING.**
==2==Master Hume, we are therefore provided. Will her ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?

**HUME.**
==3==Ay, what else? Fear you not her courage.

**BOLING.**
==4==I have heard her reported to be a woman of an invincible spirit; but it shall be convenient, Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we be busy below; and so I pray you go in God’s name, and leave us.
*(Exit Hume.)*
==5==Mother Jourdain, be you prostrate and grovel on the earth.
*(She lies down upon her face.)*
==6==John Southwell, read you; and let us to our work.

*Enter Eleanor the Duchess aloft, Hume following.*

**DUCH.**
==7==Well said, my masters, and welcome all.
==8==To this gear, the sooner the better.

**BOLING.**
==9==Patience, good lady, wizards know their times.
==10==Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
==11==The time of night when Troy was set on fire,
==12==The time when screech owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
==13==And spirits walk, and ghosts break up their graves,
==14==That time best fits the work we have in hand.
==15==Madam, sit you and fear not. Whom we raise,
==16==We will make fast within a hallow’d verge.

*Here do the ceremonies belonging, and make the circle; Bolingbrook or Southwell reads, “Conjuro te, etc.” It thunders and lightens terribly; then the Spirit riseth.*

**SPIR.**
==17==*Adsum.*

**M. JORD.**
==18==Asmath,
==19==By the eternal God, whose name and power
==20==Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
==21==For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.

**SPIR.**
==22==Ask what thou wilt. That I had said, and done!

**BOLING.**
==23==“First of the King: what shall of him become?”

*Reading out of a paper.*

**SPIR.**
==24==The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
==25==But him out-live, and die a violent death.

*As the Spirit speaks, Bolingbrook writes the answer.*

**BOLING.**
==26==“Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?”

**SPIR.**
==27==By water shall he die, and take his end.

**BOLING.**
==28==“What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?”

**SPIR.**
==29==Let him shun castles.
==30==Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
==31==Than where castles mounted stand.
==32==Have done, for more I hardly can endure.

**BOLING.**
==33==Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
==34==False fiend, avoid!

*Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit sinking down again.*

*Enter the Duke of York and the Duke of Buckingham with their Guard, Sir Humphrey Stafford as Captain, and break in.*

**YORK.**
==35==Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
==36==Beldam, I think we watch’d you at an inch.
==37==What, madam, are you there? The King and commonweal
==38==Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains.
==39==My Lord Protector will, I doubt it not,
==40==See you well guerdon’d for these good deserts.

**DUCH.**
==41==Not half so bad as thine to England’s king,
==42==Injurious duke, that threatest where’s no cause.

**BUCK.**
==43==True, madam, none at all. What call you this?
==44==Away with them, let them be clapp’d up close,
==45==And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
==46==Stafford, take her to thee.
*(Exeunt, above, Duchess and Hume guarded.)*
==47==We’ll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
==48==All away!

*Exit Guard with Jourdain, Southwell, etc.*

**YORK.**
==49==Lord Buckingham, methinks you watch’d her well.
==50==A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
==51==Now pray, my lord, let’s see the devil’s writ.
==52==What have we here?
*(Reads.)*
==53==*“The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;*
==54==*But him out-live, and die a violent death.”*
==55==Why, this is just
==56==*“Aio te, Aeacida, Romanos vincere posse.”*
==57==Well, to the rest:
==58==*“Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?”*
==59==*“By water shall he die, and take his end.”*
==60==*“What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?”*
==61==*“Let him shun castles;*
==62==*Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains*
==63==*Than where castles mounted stand.”*
==64==Come, come, my lords, these oracles
==65==Are hardly attain’d, and hardly understood.
==66==The King is now in progress towards Saint Albans,
==67==With him the husband of this lovely lady.
==68==Thither goes these news, as fast as horse can carry them⁠—
==69==A sorry breakfast for my Lord Protector.

**BUCK.**
==70==Your Grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
==71==To be the post, in hope of his reward.

**YORK.**
==72==At your pleasure, my good lord. Who’s within there, ho?
*(Enter Gloucester’s Servingman.)*
==73==Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
==74==To sup with me tomorrow night. Away!

*Exeunt.*
