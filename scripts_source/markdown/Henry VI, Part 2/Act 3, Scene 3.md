## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*London. The Cardinal’s bedchamber.*

*Enter the King, Salisbury, and Warwick to the Cardinal in bed, raving and staring as if he were mad.*

**KING.**
==1== How fares my lord? Speak, Beauford, to thy sovereign.

**CAR.**
==2== If thou beest death, I’ll give thee England’s treasure,
==3== Enough to purchase such another island,
==4== So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.

**KING.**
==5== Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,
==6== Where death’s approach is seen so terrible!

**WAR.**
==7== Beauford, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.

**CAR.**
==8== Bring me unto my trial when you will.
==9== Died he not in his bed? Where should he die?
==10== Can I make men live, whe’er they will or no?
==11== O, torture me no more, I will confess.
==12== Alive again? Then show me where he is,
==13== I’ll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
==14== He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
==15== Comb down his hair; look, look, it stands upright,
==16== Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
==17== Give me some drink, and bid the apothecary
==18== Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.

**KING.**
==19== O thou eternal Mover of the heavens,
==20== Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
==21== O, beat away the busy meddling fiend
==22== That lays strong siege unto this wretch’s soul,
==23== And from his bosom purge this black despair!

**WAR.**
==24== See how the pangs of death do make him grin!

**SAL.**
==25== Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably.

**KING.**
==26== Peace to his soul, if God’s good pleasure be!
==27== Lord Card’nal, if thou think’st on heaven’s bliss,
==28== Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
*(The Cardinal dies.)*
==29== He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!

**WAR.**
==30== So bad a death argues a monstrous life.

**KING.**
==31== Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
==32== Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close,
==33== And let us all to meditation.

*Exeunt.*
