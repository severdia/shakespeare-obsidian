## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*London. The Cardinal’s bedchamber.*

*Enter the King, Salisbury, and Warwick to the Cardinal in bed, raving and staring as if he were mad.*

**KING.**
How fares my lord? Speak, Beauford, to thy sovereign.

**CAR.**
If thou beest death, I’ll give thee England’s treasure,
Enough to purchase such another island,
So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.

**KING.**
Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,
Where death’s approach is seen so terrible!

**WAR.**
Beauford, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.

**CAR.**
Bring me unto my trial when you will.
Died he not in his bed? Where should he die?
Can I make men live, whe’er they will or no?
O, torture me no more, I will confess.
Alive again? Then show me where he is,
I’ll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
Comb down his hair; look, look, it stands upright,
Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
Give me some drink, and bid the apothecary
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.

**KING.**
O thou eternal Mover of the heavens,
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
O, beat away the busy meddling fiend
That lays strong siege unto this wretch’s soul,
And from his bosom purge this black despair!

**WAR.**
See how the pangs of death do make him grin!

**SAL.**
Disturb him not, let him pass peaceably.

**KING.**
Peace to his soul, if God’s good pleasure be!
Lord Card’nal, if thou think’st on heaven’s bliss,
Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
*(The Cardinal dies.)*
He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!

**WAR.**
So bad a death argues a monstrous life.

**KING.**
Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.
Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close,
And let us all to meditation.

*Exeunt.*
