## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*A hall of justice.*

*Sound trumpets. Enter the King and State: the Queen, Gloucester, York, Suffolk, and Salisbury, with Guard, to banish the Duchess. Enter, guarded, the Duchess of Gloucester, Margery Jourdain, Southwell, Hume, and Bolingbrook.*

**KING.**
==1==Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester’s wife:
==2==In sight of God and us, your guilt is great;
==3==Receive the sentence of the law for sins
==4==Such as by God’s book are adjudg’d to death.
==5==You four, from hence to prison back again;
==6==From thence, unto the place of execution.
==7==The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes,
==8==And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
==9==You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
==10==Despoiled of your honor in your life,
==11==Shall, after three days’ open penance done,
==12==Live in your country here in banishment,
==13==With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.

**DUCH.**
==14==Welcome is banishment, welcome were my death.

**GLOU.**
==15==Eleanor, the law, thou seest, hath judged thee;
==16==I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
*(Exeunt Duchess and other prisoners, guarded.)*
==17==Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
==18==Ah, Humphrey, this dishonor in thine age
==19==Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!
==20==I beseech your Majesty give me leave to go;
==21==Sorrow would solace, and mine age would ease.

**KING.**
==22==Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester! Ere thou go,
==23==Give up thy staff. Henry will to himself
==24==Protector be, and God shall be my hope,
==25==My stay, my guide, and lantern to my feet;
==26==And go in peace, Humphrey, no less belov’d
==27==Than when thou wert Protector to thy king.

**Q. MARG.**
==28==I see no reason why a king of years
==29==Should be to be protected like a child.
==30==God and King Henry govern England’s realm.
==31==Give up your staff, sir, and the King his realm.

**GLOU.**
==32==My staff? Here, noble Henry, is my staff.
==33==As willingly do I the same resign
==34==As ere thy father Henry made it mine;
==35==And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
==36==As others would ambitiously receive it.
==37==Farewell, good King; when I am dead and gone,
==38==May honorable peace attend thy throne!

*Exit Gloucester.*

**Q. MARG.**
==39==Why, now is Henry king and Margaret queen,
==40==And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,
==41==That bears so shrewd a maim: two pulls at once⁠—
==42==His lady banish’d, and a limb lopp’d off.
==43==This staff of honor raught, there let it stand,
==44==Where it best fits to be, in Henry’s hand.

**SUF.**
==45==Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays,
==46==Thus Eleanor’s pride dies in her youngest days.

**YORK.**
==47==Lords, let him go. Please it your Majesty,
==48==This is the day appointed for the combat,
==49==And ready are the appellant and defendant,
==50==The armorer and his man, to enter the lists,
==51==So please your Highness to behold the fight.

**Q. MARG.**
==52==Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore
==53==Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.

**KING.**
==54==A’ God’s name see the lists and all things fit;
==55==Here let them end it, and God defend the right!

**YORK.**
==56==I never saw a fellow worse bestead,
==57==Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,
==58==The servant of this armorer, my lords.

*Enter at one door Horner the armorer and his Neighbors, drinking to him so much that he is drunk; and he enters with a Drum before him and his staff with a sandbag fastened to it; and at the other door Peter, his man, with a Drum and sandbag, and Prentices drinking to him.*

**1. NEIGH.**
==59==Here, neighbor Horner, I drink to you in a cup of sack; and fear not, neighbor, you shall do well enough.

**2. NEIGH.**
==60==And here, neighbor, here’s a cup of charneco.

**3. NEIGH.**
==61==And here’s a pot of good double beer, neighbor. Drink, and fear not your man.

**HOR.**
==62==Let it come, i’faith, and I’ll pledge you all, and a fig for Peter!

**1. PREN.**
==63==Here, Peter, I drink to thee, and be not afraid.

**2. PREN.**
==64==Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master. Fight for credit of the prentices.

**PET.**
==65==I thank you all. Drink, and pray for me, I pray you, for I think I have taken my last draught in this world. Here, Robin, and if I die, I give thee my apron; and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer; and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O Lord bless me, I pray God, for I am never able to deal with my master, he hath learnt so much fence already.

**SAL.**
==66==Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows. Sirrah, what’s thy name?

**PET.**
==67==Peter, forsooth.

**SAL.**
==68==Peter? What more?

**PET.**
==69==Thump.

**SAL.**
==70==Thump? Then see thou thump thy master well.

**HOR.**
==71==Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man’s instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an honest man; and touching the Duke of York, I will take my death, I never meant him any ill, nor the King, nor the Queen; and therefore, Peter, have at thee with a downright blow!

**YORK.**
==72==Dispatch. This knave’s tongue begins to double.
==73==Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!

*Alarum. They fight, and Peter hits him on the head and strikes him down.*

**HOR.**
==74==Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.

*He dies.*

**YORK.**
==75==Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the good wine in thy master’s way.

**PET.**
*(He kneels down.)*
==76==O God, have I overcome mine enemies in this presence? O Peter, thou hast prevail’d in right!

**KING.**
==77==Go, take hence that traitor from our sight,
==78==For by his death we do perceive his guilt,
==79==And God in justice hath reveal’d to us
==80==The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
==81==Which he had thought to have murder’d wrongfully.
==82==Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.

*Sound a flourish. Exeunt.*
