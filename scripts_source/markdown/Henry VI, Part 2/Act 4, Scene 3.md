## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Another part of Blackheath.*

*Alarums to the fight, wherein both the Staffords are slain.*

*Enter Cade and the rest.*

**CADE.**
==1==Where’s Dick, the butcher of Ashford?

**DICK.**
==2==Here, sir.

**CADE.**
==3==They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughter-house; therefore thus will I reward thee: the Lent shall be as long again as it is, and thou shalt have a license to kill for a hundred lacking one.

**DICK.**
==4==I desire no more.

**CADE.**
==5==And, to speak truth, thou deserv’st no less. This monument of the victory will I bear,
*(Putting on Stafford’s armor.)*
==6==and the bodies shall be dragg’d at my horse heels till I do come to London, where we will have the Mayor’s sword borne before us.

**DICK.**
==7==If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the jails and let out the prisoners.

**CADE.**
==8==Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let’s march towards London.

*Exeunt.*
