## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*London. A room in the palace.*

*Enter the King with a supplication and the Queen with Suffolk’s head, the Duke of Buckingham and the Lord Say.*

**Q. MARG.**
==1==Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,
==2==And makes it fearful and degenerate;
==3==Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
==4==But who can cease to weep and look on this?
==5==Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast;
==6==But where’s the body that I should embrace?

**BUCK.**
==7==What answer makes your Grace to the rebels’ supplication?

**KING.**
==8==I’ll send some holy bishop to entreat;
==9==For God forbid so many simple souls
==10==Should perish by the sword! And I myself,
==11==Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
==12==Will parley with Jack Cade their general.
==13==But stay, I’ll read it over once again.

**Q. MARG.**
==14==Ah, barbarous villains! Hath this lovely face
==15==Rul’d like a wandering planet over me,
==16==And could it not enforce them to relent,
==17==That were unworthy to behold the same?

**KING.**
==18==Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.

**SAY.**
==19==Ay, but I hope your Highness shall have his.

**KING.**
==20==How now, madam?
==21==Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk’s death?
==22==I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
==23==Thou wouldst not have mourn’d so much for me.

**Q. MARG.**
==24==No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.

*Enter Second Royal Messenger.*

**KING.**
==25==How now? What news? Why com’st thou in such haste?

**2. ROYAL MESS.**
==26==The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!
==27==Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,
==28==Descended from the Duke of Clarence’ house,
==29==And calls your Grace usurper, openly,
==30==And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
==31==His army is a ragged multitude
==32==Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless.
==33==Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother’s death
==34==Hath given them heart and courage to proceed.
==35==All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,
==36==They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.

**KING.**
==37==O graceless men! They know not what they do.

**BUCK.**
==38==My gracious lord, retire to Killingworth,
==39==Until a power be rais’d to put them down.

**Q. MARG.**
==40==Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,
==41==These Kentish rebels would be soon appeas’d!

**KING.**
==42==Lord Say, the traitors hateth thee,
==43==Therefore away with us to Killingworth.

**SAY.**
==44==So might your Grace’s person be in danger.
==45==The sight of me is odious in their eyes;
==46==And therefore in this city will I stay
==47==And live alone as secret as I may.

*Enter Third Royal Messenger.*

**3. ROYAL MESS.**
==48==Jack Cade hath gotten London Bridge:
==49==The citizens fly and forsake their houses;
==50==The rascal people, thirsting after prey,
==51==Join with the traitor, and they jointly swear
==52==To spoil the city and your royal court.

**BUCK.**
==53==Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.

**KING.**
==54==Come, Margaret, God, our hope, will succor us.

**Q. MARG.**
==55==My hope is gone, now Suffolk is deceas’d.

**KING.**
==56==Farewell, my lord, trust not the Kentish rebels.

**BUCK.**
==57==Trust nobody, for fear you be betray’d.

**SAY.**
==58==The trust I have is in mine innocence,
==59==And therefore am I bold and resolute.

*Exeunt.*
