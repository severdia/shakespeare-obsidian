## Act 4, Scene 9
[[Act 4, Scene 8|← Act 4, Scene 8]] | [[Act 4, Scene 10|Act 4, Scene 10 →]]

*Kenilworth Castle.*

*Sound trumpets. Enter King, Queen, and Somerset on the tarras.*

**KING.**
==1== Was ever king that joy’d an earthly throne
==2== And could command no more content than I?
==3== No sooner was I crept out of my cradle
==4== But I was made a king, at nine months old.
==5== Was never subject long’d to be a king
==6== As I do long and wish to be a subject.

*Enter Buckingham and old Clifford.*

**BUCK.**
==7== Health and glad tidings to your Majesty!

**KING.**
==8== Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surpris’d?
==9== Or is he but retir’d to make him strong?

*Enter, below, multitudes with halters about their necks.*

**CLIF.**
==10== He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield,
==11== And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,
==12== Expect your Highness’ doom, of life or death.

**KING.**
==13== Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates
==14== To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!
==15== Soldiers, this day have you redeem’d your lives,
==16== And show’d how well you love your prince and country:
==17== Continue still in this so good a mind,
==18== And Henry, though he be infortunate,
==19== Assure yourselves, will never be unkind.
==20== And so with thanks and pardon to you all,
==21== I do dismiss you to your several countries.

**CADE. FOLL.**
==22== God save the King! God save the King!

*Enter Fourth Royal Messenger.*

**4. ROYAL MESS.**
==23== Please it your Grace to be advertised
==24== The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,
==25== And with a puissant and a mighty power
==26== Of gallowglasses and stout kerns
==27== Is marching hitherward in proud array,
==28== And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,
==29== His arms are only to remove from thee
==30== The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms a traitor.

**KING.**
==31== Thus stands my state, ’twixt Cade and York distress’d,
==32== Like to a ship that, having scap’d a tempest,
==33== Is straightway calm’d and boarded with a pirate.
==34== But now is Cade driven back, his men dispers’d,
==35== And now is York in arms to second him.
==36== I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,
==37== And ask him what’s the reason of these arms.
==38== Tell him I’ll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;
==39== And, Somerset, we will commit thee thither,
==40== Until his army be dismiss’d from him.

**SOM.**
==41== My lord,
==42== I’ll yield myself to prison willingly,
==43== Or unto death, to do my country good.

**KING.**
==44== In any case, be not too rough in terms,
==45== For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.

**BUCK.**
==46== I will, my lord, and doubt not so to deal
==47== As all things shall redound unto your good.

**KING.**
==48== Come, wife, let’s in, and learn to govern better,
==49== For yet may England curse my wretched reign.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
