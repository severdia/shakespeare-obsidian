## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*London. A room in the palace.*

*Enter three or four Petitioners, Peter the Armorer’s man being one.*

**1. PETIT.**
==1==My masters, let’s stand close. My Lord Protector will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill.

**2. PETIT.**
==2==Marry, the Lord protect him, for he’s a good man! Jesu bless him!

*Enter Suffolk and Queen.*

**PET.**
==3==Here ’a comes, methinks, and the Queen with him. I’ll be the first, sure.

**2. PETIT.**
==4==Come back, fool. This is the Duke of Suffolk and not my Lord Protector.

**SUF.**
==5==How now, fellow? Wouldst any thing with me?

**1. PETIT.**
==6==I pray, my lord, pardon me, I took ye for my Lord Protector.

**Q. MARG.**
*(Reading.)*
==7==*“To my Lord Protector”?*
==8==Are your supplications to his lordship? Let me see them. What is thine?

**1. PETIT.**
==9==Mine is, and’t please your Grace, against John Goodman, my Lord Cardinal’s man, for keeping my house, and lands, and wife and all, from me.

**SUF.**
==10==Thy wife too? That’s some wrong indeed. What’s yours? What’s here?
*(Reads.)*
==11==*“Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the commons of Melford.” How now, sir knave?*

**2. PETIT.**
==12==Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.

**PET.**
*(Giving his petition.)*
==13==Against my master, Thomas Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown.

**Q. MARG.**
==14==What say’st thou? Did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown?

**PET.**
==15==That my master was? No, forsooth; my master said that he was, and that the King was an usurper.

**SUF.**
==16==Who is there?
*(Enter Servant.)*
==17==Take this fellow in, and send for his master with a pursuivant presently. We’ll hear more of your matter before the King.

*Exit Servant with Peter.*

**Q. MARG.**
==18==And as for you, that love to be protected
==19==Under the wings of our Protector’s grace,
==20==Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.
*(Tear the supplication.)*
==21==Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.

**ALL PETITIONERS.**
==22==Come, let’s be gone.

*Exeunt.*

**Q. MARG.**
==23==My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
==24==Is this the fashions in the court of England?
==25==Is this the government of Britain’s isle,
==26==And this the royalty of Albion’s king?
==27==What, shall King Henry be a pupil still
==28==Under the surly Gloucester’s governance?
==29==Am I a queen in title and in style,
==30==And must be made a subject to a duke?
==31==I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
==32==Thou ran’st a-tilt in honor of my love
==33==And stol’st away the ladies’ hearts of France,
==34==I thought King Henry had resembled thee
==35==In courage, courtship, and proportion;
==36==But all his mind is bent to holiness,
==37==To number Ave-Maries on his beads;
==38==His champions are the prophets and apostles,
==39==His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
==40==His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
==41==Are brazen images of canonized saints.
==42==I would the college of the Cardinals
==43==Would choose him Pope and carry him to Rome,
==44==And set the triple crown upon his head⁠—
==45==That were a state fit for his holiness.

**SUF.**
==46==Madam, be patient. As I was cause
==47==Your Highness came to England, so will I
==48==In England work your Grace’s full content.

**Q. MARG.**
==49==Beside the haughty Protector, have we Beauford
==50==The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
==51==And grumbling York; and not the least of these
==52==But can do more in England than the King.

**SUF.**
==53==And he of these that can do most of all
==54==Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
==55==Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.

**Q. MARG.**
==56==Not all these lords do vex me half so much
==57==As that proud dame, the Lord Protector’s wife:
==58==She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,
==59==More like an empress than Duke Humphrey’s wife.
==60==Strangers in court do take her for the Queen.
==61==She bears a duke’s revenues on her back,
==62==And in her heart she scorns our poverty.
==63==Shall I not live to be aveng’d on her?
==64==Contemptuous base-born callot as she is,
==65==She vaunted ’mongst her minions t’ other day,
==66==The very train of her worst wearing gown
==67==Was better worth than all my father’s lands,
==68==Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.

**SUF.**
==69==Madam, myself have lim’d a bush for her,
==70==And plac’d a choir of such enticing birds
==71==That she will light to listen to the lays,
==72==And never mount to trouble you again.
==73==So let her rest; and, madam, list to me,
==74==For I am bold to counsel you in this.
==75==Although we fancy not the Cardinal,
==76==Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
==77==Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
==78==As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
==79==Will make but little for his benefit.
==80==So one by one we’ll weed them all at last,
==81==And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.

*Sound a sennet. Enter the King, Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, Cardinal, Buckingham, York, Somerset, Salisbury, Warwick, and the Duchess of Gloucester.*

**KING.**
==82==For my part, noble lords, I care not which,
==83==Or Somerset or York, all’s one to me.

**YORK.**
==84==If York have ill demean’d himself in France,
==85==Then let him be denay’d the regentship.

**SOM.**
==86==If Somerset be unworthy of the place,
==87==Let York be Regent, I will yield to him.

**WAR.**
==88==Whether your Grace be worthy, yea or no,
==89==Dispute not that; York is the worthier.

**CAR.**
==90==Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.

**WAR.**
==91==The Cardinal’s not my better in the field.

**BUCK.**
==92==All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.

**WAR.**
==93==Warwick may live to be the best of all.

**SAL.**
==94==Peace, son, and show some reason, Buckingham,
==95==Why Somerset should be preferr’d in this.

**Q. MARG.**
==96==Because the King, forsooth, will have it so.

**GLOU.**
==97==Madam, the King is old enough himself
==98==To give his censure. These are no women’s matters.

**Q. MARG.**
==99==If he be old enough, what needs your Grace
==100==To be Protector of his Excellence?

**GLOU.**
==101==Madam, I am Protector of the realm,
==102==And at his pleasure will resign my place.

**SUF.**
==103==Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
==104==Since thou wert king—as who is king but thou?⁠—
==105==The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack,
==106==The Dauphin hath prevail’d beyond the seas,
==107==And all the peers and nobles of the realm
==108==Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.

**CAR.**
==109==The commons hast thou rack’d, the clergy’s bags
==110==Are lank and lean with thy extortions.

**SOM.**
==111==Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wive’s attire
==112==Have cost a mass of public treasury.

**BUCK.**
==113==Thy cruelty in execution
==114==Upon offenders hath exceeded law,
==115==And left thee to the mercy of the law.

**Q. MARG.**
==116==Thy sale of offices and towns in France,
==117==If they were known, as the suspect is great,
==118==Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.
*(Exit Humphrey. The Queen lets fall her fan.)*
==119==Give me my fan. What, minion, can ye not?
*(She gives the Duchess a box on the ear.)*
==120==I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?

**DUCH.**
==121==Was’t I? Yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman.
==122==Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
==123==I could set my ten commandments in your face.

**KING.**
==124==Sweet aunt, be quiet, ’twas against her will.

**DUCH.**
==125==Against her will, good king? Look to’t in time,
==126==She’ll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby.
==127==Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
==128==She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng’d.

*Exit Eleanor.*

**BUCK.**
==129==Lord Cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
==130==And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds.
==131==She’s tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,
==132==She’ll gallop far enough to her destruction.

*Exit Buckingham.*

*Enter Humphrey of Gloucester.*

**GLOU.**
==133==Now, lords, my choler being overblown
==134==With walking once about the quadrangle,
==135==I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
==136==As for your spiteful false objections,
==137==Prove them, and I lie open to the law;
==138==But God in mercy so deal with my soul
==139==As I in duty love my king and country!
==140==But to the matter that we have in hand.
==141==I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man
==142==To be your Regent in the realm of France.

**SUF.**
==143==Before we make election, give me leave
==144==To show some reason, of no little force,
==145==That York is most unmeet of any man.

**YORK.**
==146==I’ll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
==147==First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
==148==Next, if I be appointed for the place,
==149==My Lord of Somerset will keep me here
==150==Without discharge, money, or furniture,
==151==Till France be won into the Dauphin’s hands.
==152==Last time, I danc’d attendance on his will
==153==Till Paris was besieg’d, famish’d, and lost.

**WAR.**
==154==That can I witness, and a fouler fact
==155==Did never traitor in the land commit.

**SUF.**
==156==Peace, headstrong Warwick!

**WAR.**
==157==Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?

*Enter Horner the armorer and his man Peter, guarded.*

**SUF.**
==158==Because here is a man accused of treason.
==159==Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!

**YORK.**
==160==Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?

**KING.**
==161==What mean’st thou, Suffolk? Tell me, what are these?

**SUF.**
==162==Please it your Majesty, this is the man
==163==That doth accuse his master of high treason.
==164==His words were these: that Richard Duke of York
==165==Was rightful heir unto the English crown
==166==And that your Majesty was an usurper.

**KING.**
==167==Say, man, were these thy words?

**HOR.**
==168==And’t shall please your Majesty, I never said nor thought any such matter. God is my witness, I am falsely accus’d by the villain.

**PET.**
==169==By these ten bones, my lords
*(Holding up his hands.)*
==170==he did speak them to me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my Lord of York’s armor.

**YORK.**
==171==Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
==172==I’ll have thy head for this thy traitor’s speech.
==173==I do beseech your royal Majesty,
==174==Let him have all the rigor of the law.

**HOR.**
==175==Alas, my lord, hang me if ever I spake the words. My accuser is my prentice, and when I did correct him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me. I have good witness of this; therefore I beseech your Majesty, do not cast away an honest man for a villain’s accusation.

**KING.**
==176==Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?

**GLOU.**
==177==This doom, my lord, if I may judge:
==178==Let Somerset be Regent o’er the French,
==179==Because in York this breeds suspicion;
==180==And let these have a day appointed them
==181==For single combat in convenient place,
==182==For he hath witness of his servant’s malice.
==183==This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey’s doom.

**SOM.**
==184==I humbly thank your royal Majesty.

**HOR.**
==185==And I accept the combat willingly.

**PET.**
==186==Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God’s sake pity my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!

**GLOU.**
==187==Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang’d.

**KING.**
==188==Away with them to prison; and the day of combat shall be the last of the next month. Come, Somerset, we’ll see thee sent away.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
