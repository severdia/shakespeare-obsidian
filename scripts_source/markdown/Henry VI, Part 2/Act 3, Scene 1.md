## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*The Abbey at Bury Saint Edmunds.*

*Sound a sennet. Enter two Heralds before. Then enter King, Queen, Cardinal, Suffolk, York, Buckingham, Salisbury, and Warwick to the parliament.*

**KING.**
==1==I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come;
==2==’Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
==3==What e’er occasion keeps him from us now.

**Q. MARG.**
==4==Can you not see? Or will ye not observe
==5==The strangeness of his alter’d countenance?
==6==With what a majesty he bears himself,
==7==How insolent of late he is become,
==8==How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
==9==We know the time since he was mild and affable,
==10==And if we did but glance a far-off look,
==11==Immediately he was upon his knee,
==12==That all the court admir’d him for submission;
==13==But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
==14==When every one will give the time of day,
==15==He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
==16==And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
==17==Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
==18==Small curs are not regarded when they grin,
==19==But great men tremble when the lion roars,
==20==And Humphrey is no little man in England.
==21==First note that he is near you in descent,
==22==And should you fall, he is the next will mount.
==23==Me seemeth then it is no policy,
==24==Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
==25==And his advantage following your decease,
==26==That he should come about your royal person,
==27==Or be admitted to your Highness’ Council.
==28==By flattery hath he won the commons’ hearts;
==29==And when he please to make commotion,
==30==’Tis to be fear’d they all will follow him.
==31==Now ’tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
==32==Suffer them now, and they’ll o’ergrow the garden,
==33==And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
==34==The reverent care I bear unto my lord
==35==Made me collect these dangers in the Duke.
==36==If it be fond, call it a woman’s fear;
==37==Which fear, if better reasons can supplant,
==38==I will subscribe, and say I wrong’d the Duke.
==39==My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
==40==Reprove my allegation if you can,
==41==Or else conclude my words effectual.

**SUF.**
==42==Well hath your Highness seen into this duke;
==43==And, had I first been put to speak my mind,
==44==I think I should have told your Grace’s tale.
==45==The Duchess by his subornation,
==46==Upon my life, began her devilish practices;
==47==Or if he were not privy to those faults,
==48==Yet, by reputing of his high descent,
==49==As next the King he was successive heir,
==50==And such high vaunts of his nobility,
==51==Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick Duchess
==52==By wicked means to frame our sovereign’s fall.
==53==Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,
==54==And in his simple show he harbors treason.
==55==The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
==56==No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man
==57==Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.

**CAR.**
==58==Did he not, contrary to form of law,
==59==Devise strange deaths for small offenses done?

**YORK.**
==60==And did he not, in his protectorship,
==61==Levy great sums of money through the realm
==62==For soldiers’ pay in France, and never sent it,
==63==By means whereof the towns each day revolted?

**BUCK.**
==64==Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown,
==65==Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey.

**KING.**
==66==My lords, at once: the care you have of us
==67==To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot
==68==Is worthy praise; but shall I speak my conscience,
==69==Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
==70==From meaning treason to our royal person
==71==As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove.
==72==The Duke is virtuous, mild, and too well given
==73==To dream on evil or to work my downfall.

**Q. MARG.**
==74==Ah, what’s more dangerous than this fond affiance!
==75==Seems he a dove? His feathers are but borrow’d,
==76==For he’s disposed as the hateful raven.
==77==Is he a lamb? His skin is surely lent him,
==78==For he’s inclin’d as is the ravenous wolves.
==79==Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
==80==Take heed, my lord, the welfare of us all
==81==Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.

*Enter Somerset.*

**SOM.**
==82==All health unto my gracious sovereign!

**KING.**
==83==Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?

**SOM.**
==84==That all your interest in those territories
==85==Is utterly bereft you: all is lost.

**KING.**
==86==Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God’s will be done!

**YORK.**
*(Aside.)*
==87==Cold news for me; for I had hope of France
==88==As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
==89==Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud,
==90==And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
==91==But I will remedy this gear ere long,
==92==Or sell my title for a glorious grave.

*Enter Gloucester.*

**GLOU.**
==93==All happiness unto my lord the King!
==94==Pardon, my liege, that I have stay’d so long.

**SUF.**
==95==Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
==96==Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art.
==97==I do arrest thee of high treason here.

**GLOU.**
==98==Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush
==99==Nor change my countenance for this arrest;
==100==A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
==101==The purest spring is not so free from mud
==102==As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.
==103==Who can accuse me? Wherein am I guilty?

**YORK.**
==104==’Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,
==105==And being Protector, stay’d the soldiers’ pay,
==106==By means whereof his Highness hath lost France.

**GLOU.**
==107==Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?
==108==I never robb’d the soldiers of their pay,
==109==Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
==110==So help me God, as I have watch’d the night,
==111==Ay, night by night, in studying good for England.
==112==That doit that e’er I wrested from the King,
==113==Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
==114==Be brought against me at my trial day!
==115==No; many a pound of mine own proper store,
==116==Because I would not tax the needy commons,
==117==Have I dispursed to the garrisons,
==118==And never ask’d for restitution.

**CAR.**
==119==It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.

**GLOU.**
==120==I say no more than truth, so help me God!

**YORK.**
==121==In your protectorship you did devise
==122==Strange tortures for offenders, never heard of,
==123==That England was defam’d by tyranny.

**GLOU.**
==124==Why, ’tis well known that, whiles I was Protector,
==125==Pity was all the fault that was in me;
==126==For I should melt at an offender’s tears,
==127==And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
==128==Unless it were a bloody murderer,
==129==Or foul felonious thief that fleec’d poor passengers,
==130==I never gave them condign punishment.
==131==Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortur’d
==132==Above the felon or what trespass else.

**SUF.**
==133==My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answer’d;
==134==But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,
==135==Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
==136==I do arrest you in his Highness’ name,
==137==And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal
==138==To keep, until your further time of trial.

**KING.**
==139==My Lord of Gloucester, ’tis my special hope
==140==That you will clear yourself from all suspense.
==141==My conscience tells me you are innocent.

**GLOU.**
==142==Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:
==143==Virtue is chok’d with foul ambition,
==144==And charity chas’d hence by rancor’s hand;
==145==Foul subornation is predominant,
==146==And equity exil’d your Highness’ land.
==147==I know their complot is to have my life;
==148==And if my death might make this island happy,
==149==And prove the period of their tyranny,
==150==I would expend it with all willingness.
==151==But mine is made the prologue to their play;
==152==For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
==153==Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
==154==Beauford’s red sparkling eyes blab his heart’s malice,
==155==And Suffolk’s cloudy brow his stormy hate;
==156==Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue
==157==The envious load that lies upon his heart;
==158==And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
==159==Whose overweening arm I have pluck’d back,
==160==By false accuse doth level at my life.
==161==And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
==162==Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
==163==And with your best endeavor have stirr’d up
==164==My liefest liege to be mine enemy.
==165==Ay, all of you have laid your heads together⁠—
==166==Myself had notice of your conventicles⁠—
==167==And all to make away my guiltless life.
==168==I shall not want false witness to condemn me,
==169==Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt.
==170==The ancient proverb will be well effected:
==171==“A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.”

**CAR.**
==172==My liege, his railing is intolerable.
==173==If those that care to keep your royal person
==174==From treason’s secret knife and traitors’ rage
==175==Be thus upbraided, chid, and rated at,
==176==And the offender granted scope of speech,
==177==’Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace.

**SUF.**
==178==Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
==179==With ignominious words, though clerkly couch’d,
==180==As if she had suborned some to swear
==181==False allegations to o’erthrow his state?

**Q. MARG.**
==182==But I can give the loser leave to chide.

**GLOU.**
==183==Far truer spoke than meant. I lose indeed;
==184==Beshrew the winners, for they play’d me false!
==185==And well such losers may have leave to speak.

**BUCK.**
==186==He’ll wrest the sense and hold us here all day.
==187==Lord Cardinal, he is your prisoner.

**CAR.**
==188==Sirs, take away the Duke, and guard him sure.

**GLOU.**
==189==Ah, thus King Henry throws away his crutch
==190==Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
==191==Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
==192==And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
==193==Ah, that my fear were false, ah, that it were!
==194==For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.

*Exit Gloucester with the Cardinal’s Men.*

**KING.**
==195==My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,
==196==Do or undo, as if ourself were here.

**Q. MARG.**
==197==What, will your Highness leave the parliament?

**KING.**
==198==Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown’d with grief,
==199==Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes;
==200==My body round engirt with misery⁠—
==201==For what’s more miserable than discontent?
==202==Ah, uncle Humphrey, in thy face I see
==203==The map of honor, truth, and loyalty;
==204==And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
==205==That e’er I prov’d thee false or fear’d thy faith.
==206==What low’ring star now envies thy estate,
==207==That these great lords, and Margaret our queen,
==208==Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
==209==Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
==210==And as the butcher takes away the calf,
==211==And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
==212==Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
==213==Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;
==214==And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
==215==Looking the way her harmless young one went,
==216==And can do nought but wail her darling’s loss,
==217==Even so myself bewails good Gloucester’s case
==218==With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm’d eyes
==219==Look after him, and cannot do him good,
==220==So mighty are his vowed enemies.
==221==His fortunes I will weep, and ’twixt each groan
==222==Say, “Who’s a traitor, Gloucester he is none.”

*Exit with Buckingham, Salisbury, and Warwick.*

**Q. MARG.**
==223==Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun’s hot beams:
==224==Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,
==225==Too full of foolish pity; and Gloucester’s show
==226==Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
==227==With sorrow snares relenting passengers;
==228==Or as the snake roll’d in a flow’ring bank,
==229==With shining checker’d slough, doth sting a child
==230==That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
==231==Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I⁠—
==232==And yet herein I judge mine own wit good⁠—
==233==This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,
==234==To rid us from the fear we have of him.

**CAR.**
==235==That he should die is worthy policy,
==236==But yet we want a color for his death.
==237==’Tis meet he be condemn’d by course of law.

**SUF.**
==238==But, in my mind, that were no policy:
==239==The King will labor still to save his life,
==240==The commons haply rise, to save his life;
==241==And yet we have but trivial argument,
==242==More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.

**YORK.**
==243==So that, by this, you would not have him die.

**SUF.**
==244==Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!

**YORK.**
==245==’Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
==246==But, my Lord Cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,
==247==Say as you think, and speak it from your souls:
==248==Were’t not all one, an empty eagle were set
==249==To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,
==250==As place Duke Humphrey for the King’s Protector?

**Q. MARG.**
==251==So the poor chicken should be sure of death.

**SUF.**
==252==Madam, ’tis true; and were’t not madness then,
==253==To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
==254==Who being accus’d a crafty murderer,
==255==His guilt should be but idly posted over,
==256==Because his purpose is not executed.
==257==No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
==258==By nature prov’d an enemy to the flock,
==259==Before his chaps be stain’d with crimson blood,
==260==As Humphrey, prov’d by reasons, to my liege.
==261==And do not stand on quillets how to slay him;
==262==Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,
==263==Sleeping, or waking, ’tis no matter how,
==264==So he be dead; for that is good deceit
==265==Which mates him first that first intends deceit.

**Q. MARG.**
==266==Thrice-noble Suffolk, ’tis resolutely spoke.

**SUF.**
==267==Not resolute, except so much were done,
==268==For things are often spoke and seldom meant;
==269==But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,
==270==Seeing the deed is meritorious,
==271==And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
==272==Say but the word, and I will be his priest.

**CAR.**
==273==But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,
==274==Ere you can take due orders for a priest.
==275==Say you consent, and censure well the deed,
==276==And I’ll provide his executioner,
==277==I tender so the safety of my liege.

**SUF.**
==278==Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.

**Q. MARG.**
==279==And so say I.

**YORK.**
==280==And I; and now we three have spoke it,
==281==It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.

*Enter a Post.*

**POST.**
==282==Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,
==283==To signify that rebels there are up
==284==And put the Englishmen unto the sword.
==285==Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,
==286==Before the wound do grow uncurable;
==287==For being green, there is great hope of help.

*Exit.*

**CAR.**
==288==A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
==289==What counsel give you in this weighty cause?

**YORK.**
==290==That Somerset be sent as Regent thither:
==291==’Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ’d⁠—
==292==Witness the fortune he hath had in France.

**SOM.**
==293==If York, with all his far-fet policy,
==294==Had been the Regent there in stead of me,
==295==He never would have stay’d in France so long.

**YORK.**
==296==No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done.
==297==I rather would have lost my life betimes
==298==Than bring a burden of dishonor home
==299==By staying there so long till all were lost.
==300==Show me one scar character’d on thy skin:
==301==Men’s flesh preserv’d so whole do seldom win.

**Q. MARG.**
==302==Nay then, this spark will prove a raging fire,
==303==If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with.
==304==No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still.
==305==Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been Regent there,
==306==Might happily have prov’d far worse than his.

**YORK.**
==307==What, worse than nought? Nay, then a shame take all!

**SOM.**
==308==And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!

**CAR.**
==309==My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.
==310==Th’ uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms,
==311==And temper clay with blood of Englishmen.
==312==To Ireland will you lead a band of men,
==313==Collected choicely, from each county some,
==314==And try your hap against the Irishmen?

**YORK.**
==315==I will, my lord, so please his Majesty.

**SUF.**
==316==Why, our authority is his consent,
==317==And what we do establish he confirms.
==318==Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.

**YORK.**
==319==I am content. Provide me soldiers, lords,
==320==Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.

**SUF.**
==321==A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform’d.
==322==But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.

**CAR.**
==323==No more of him; for I will deal with him
==324==That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
==325==And so break off, the day is almost spent;
==326==Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.

**YORK.**
==327==My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days
==328==At Bristow I expect my soldiers,
==329==For there I’ll ship them all for Ireland.

**SUF.**
==330==I’ll see it truly done, my Lord of York.

*Exeunt. Manet York.*

**YORK.**
==331==Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
==332==And change misdoubt to resolution;
==333==Be that thou hop’st to be, or what thou art
==334==Resign to death; it is not worth th’ enjoying.
==335==Let pale-fac’d fear keep with the mean-born man,
==336==And find no harbor in a royal heart.
==337==Faster than spring-time show’rs comes thought on thought,
==338==And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
==339==My brain, more busy than the laboring spider,
==340==Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
==341==Well, nobles, well; ’tis politicly done,
==342==To send me packing with an host of men:
==343==I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
==344==Who, cherish’d in your breasts, will sting your hearts.
==345==’Twas men I lack’d, and you will give them me;
==346==I take it kindly. Yet be well assur’d
==347==You put sharp weapons in a madman’s hands.
==348==Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
==349==I will stir up in England some black storm
==350==Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
==351==And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
==352==Until the golden circuit on my head,
==353==Like to the glorious sun’s transparent beams,
==354==Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
==355==And for a minister of my intent,
==356==I have seduc’d a headstrong Kentishman,
==357==John Cade of Ashford,
==358==To make commotion, as full well he can,
==359==Under the title of John Mortimer.
==360==In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
==361==Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
==362==And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
==363==Were almost like a sharp-quill’d porpentine;
==364==And in the end being rescued, I have seen
==365==Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
==366==Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
==367==Full often, like a shag-hair’d crafty kern,
==368==Hath he conversed with the enemy,
==369==And undiscover’d come to me again,
==370==And given me notice of their villainies.
==371==This devil here shall be my substitute;
==372==For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
==373==In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble.
==374==By this I shall perceive the commons’ mind,
==375==How they affect the house and claim of York.
==376==Say he be taken, rack’d, and tortured,
==377==I know no pain they can inflict upon him
==378==Will make him say I mov’d him to those arms.
==379==Say that he thrive, as ’tis great like he will,
==380==Why then from Ireland come I with my strength,
==381==And reap the harvest which that rascal sow’d.
==382==For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
==383==And Henry put apart, the next for me.

*Exit.*
