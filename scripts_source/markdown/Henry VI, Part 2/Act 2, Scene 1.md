## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Saint Albans.*

*Enter the King, Queen with her hawk on her fist, Protector Gloucester, Cardinal, and Suffolk, with Falc’ners hallowing.*

**Q. MARG.**
==1==Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
==2==I saw not better sport these seven years’ day;
==3==Yet by your leave, the wind was very high,
==4==And ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.

**KING.**
==5==But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
==6==And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
==7==To see how God in all his creatures works!
==8==Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.

**SUF.**
==9==No marvel, and it like your Majesty,
==10==My Lord Protector’s hawks do tow’r so well;
==11==They know their master loves to be aloft,
==12==And bears his thoughts above his falcon’s pitch.

**GLOU.**
==13==My lord, ’tis but a base ignoble mind
==14==That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.

**CAR.**
==15==I thought as much, he would be above the clouds.

**GLOU.**
==16==Ay, my Lord Cardinal, how think you by that?
==17==Were it not good your Grace could fly to heaven?

**KING.**
==18==The treasury of everlasting joy.

**CAR.**
==19==Thy heaven is on earth, thine eyes and thoughts
==20==Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart,
==21==Pernicious Protector, dangerous peer,
==22==That smooth’st it so with king and commonweal!

**GLOU.**
==23==What, Cardinal? Is your priesthood grown peremptory?
==24==*Tantaene animis caelestibus irae?*
==25==Churchmen so hot? Good uncle, hide such malice;
==26==With such holiness can you do it?

**SUF.**
==27==No malice, sir, no more than well becomes
==28==So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.

**GLOU.**
==29==As who, my lord?

**SUF.**
==29==           Why, as you, my lord,
==30==An’t like your lordly Lord’s Protectorship.

**GLOU.**
==31==Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.

**Q. MARG.**
==32==And thy ambition, Gloucester.

**KING.**
==32==                I prithee peace,
==33==Good queen, and whet not on these furious peers,
==34==For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.

**CAR.**
==35==Let me be blessed for the peace I make
==36==Against this proud Protector with my sword!

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Cardinal)*
==37==Faith, holy uncle, would’t were come to that!

**CAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==38==Marry, when thou dar’st.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Cardinal)*
==39==Make up no factious numbers for the matter,
==40==In thine own person answer thy abuse.

**CAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==41==Ay, where thou dar’st not peep. And if thou dar’st,
==42==This evening, on the east side of the grove.

**KING.**
==43==How now, my lords?

**CAR.**
==43==           Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
==44==Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
==45==We had had more sport.
*(Aside to Gloucester.)*
==45==              Come with thy two-hand sword.

**GLOU.**
==46==True, uncle.

**CAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester)*
==47==Are ye advis’d? The east side of the grove.

**GLOU.**
*(Aside to Cardinal)*
==48==Cardinal, I am with you.

**KING.**
==48==              Why, how now, uncle Gloucester?

**GLOU.**
==49==Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.
*(Aside to Cardinal.)*
==50==Now by God’s Mother, priest,
==51==I’ll shave your crown for this,
==52==Or all my fence shall fail.

**CAR.**
*(Aside to Gloucester.)*
==52==              *Medice, teipsum*⁠—
==53==Protector, see to’t well, protect yourself.

**KING.**
==54==The winds grow high, so do your stomachs, lords.
==55==How irksome is this music to my heart!
==56==When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
==57==I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.

*Enter one crying, “A miracle!” *

**GLOU.**
==58==What means this noise?
==59==Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?

**ONE. CIT.**
==60==A miracle, a miracle!

**SUF.**
==61==Come to the King and tell him what miracle.

**ONE. CIT.**
==62==Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban’s shrine,
==63==Within this half hour, hath receiv’d his sight,
==64==A man that ne’er saw in his life before.

**KING.**
==65==Now God be prais’d, that to believing souls
==66==Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!

*Enter the Mayor of Saint Albans and his Brethren, with music, bearing the man Simpcox between two in a chair, Simpcox’s Wife and others following.*

**CAR.**
==67==Here comes the townsmen on procession,
==68==To present your Highness with the man.

**KING.**
==69==Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
==70==Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.

**GLOU.**
==71==Stand by, my masters. Bring him near the King,
==72==His Highness’ pleasure is to talk with him.

**KING.**
==73==Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
==74==That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
==75==What, hast thou been long blind and now restor’d?

**SIMP.**
==76==Born blind, and’t please your Grace.

**SIMP. WIFE.**
==77==Ay indeed was he.

**SUF.**
==78==What woman is this?

**SIMP. WIFE.**
==79==His wife, and’t like your worship.

**GLOU.**
==80==Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better told.

**KING.**
==81==Where wert thou born?

**SIMP.**
==82==At Berwick in the north, and’t like your Grace.

**KING.**
==83==Poor soul, God’s goodness hath been great to thee.
==84==Let never day nor night unhallowed pass,
==85==But still remember what the Lord hath done.

**Q. MARG.**
==86==Tell me, good fellow, cam’st thou here by chance
==87==Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?

**SIMP.**
==88==God knows, of pure devotion, being call’d
==89==A hundred times and oft’ner, in my sleep,
==90==By good Saint Alban, who said, “Simon, come;
==91==Come offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.”

**SIMP. WIFE.**
==92==Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
==93==Myself have heard a voice to call him so.

**CAR.**
==94==What, art thou lame?

**SIMP.**
==94==           Ay, God Almighty help me!

**SUF.**
==95==How cam’st thou so?

**SIMP.**
==95==           A fall off of a tree.

**SIMP. WIFE.**
==96==A plum-tree, master.

**GLOU.**
==96==           How long hast thou been blind?

**SIMP.**
==97==O, born so, master.

**GLOU.**
==97==        What, and wouldst climb a tree?

**SIMP.**
==98==But that in all my life, when I was a youth.

**SIMP. WIFE.**
==99==Too true, and bought his climbing very dear.

**GLOU.**
==100==Mass, thou lov’dst plums well, that wouldst venture so.

**SIMP.**
==101==Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,
==102==And made me climb, with danger of my life.

**GLOU.**
==103==A subtile knave, but yet it shall not serve.
==104==Let me see thine eyes. Wink now; now open them.
==105==In my opinion yet thou seest not well.

**SIMP.**
==106==Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.

**GLOU.**
==107==Say’st thou me so? What color is this cloak of?

**SIMP.**
==108==Red, master, red as blood.

**GLOU.**
==109==Why, that’s well said. What color is my gown of?

**SIMP.**
==110==Black, forsooth, coal-black as jet.

**KING.**
==111==Why then, thou know’st what color jet is of?

**SUF.**
==112==And yet, I think, jet did he never see.

**GLOU.**
==113==But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.

**SIMP. WIFE.**
==114==Never, before this day, in all his life.

**GLOU.**
==115==Tell me, sirrah, what’s my name?

**SIMP.**
==116==Alas, master, I know not.

**GLOU.**
==117==What’s his name?

**SIMP.**
==118==I know not.

**GLOU.**
==119==Nor his?

**SIMP.**
==120==No indeed, master.

**GLOU.**
==121==What’s thine own name?

**SIMP.**
==122==Saunder Simpcox, and if it please you, master.

**GLOU.**
==123==Then, Saunder, sit there, the lying’st knave
==124==In Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind,
==125==Thou mightst as well have known all our names, as thus
==126==To name the several colors we do wear.
==127==Sight may distinguish colors; but suddenly
==128==To nominate them all, it is impossible.
==129==My lords, Saint Alban here hath done a miracle;
==130==And would ye not think his cunning to be great,
==131==That could restore this cripple to his legs again?

**SIMP.**
==132==O master, that you could!

**GLOU.**
==133==My masters of Saint Albans, have you not
==134==Beadles in your town, and things call’d whips?

**MAY.**
==135==Yes, my lord, if it please your Grace.

**GLOU.**
==136==Then send for one presently.

**MAY.**
==137==Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.

*Exit One Citizen.*

**GLOU.**
==138==Now fetch me a stool hither by and by.
*(A stool brought.)*
==139==Now, sirrah, if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me over this stool and run away.

**SIMP.**
==140==Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone;
==141==You go about to torture me in vain.

*Enter a Beadle with whips.*

**GLOU.**
==142==Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.

**BEAD.**
==143==I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah, off with your doublet quickly.

**SIMP.**
==144==Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.

*After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry, “A miracle!” *

**KING.**
==145==O God, seest thou this, and bearest so long?

**Q. MARG.**
==146==It made me laugh to see the villain run.

**GLOU.**
==147==Follow the knave, and take this drab away.

**SIMP. WIFE.**
==148==Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.

**GLOU.**
==149==Lee them be whipt through every market town,
==150==Till they come to Berwick, from whence they came.

*Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor, etc.*

**CAR.**
==151==Duke Humphrey has done a miracle today.

**SUF.**
==152==True; made the lame to leap and fly away.

**GLOU.**
==153==But you have done more miracles than I:
==154==You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.

*Enter Buckingham.*

**KING.**
==155==What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?

**BUCK.**
==156==Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold:
==157==A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
==158==Under the countenance and confederacy
==159==Of Lady Eleanor, the Protector’s wife,
==160==The ringleader and head of all this rout,
==161==Have practic’d dangerously against your state,
==162==Dealing with witches and with conjurers,
==163==Whom we have apprehended in the fact,
==164==Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,
==165==Demanding of King Henry’s life and death,
==166==And other of your Highness’ Privy Council,
==167==As more at large your Grace shall understand.

**CAR.**
==168==And so, my Lord Protector, by this means
==169==Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
*(Aside to Gloucester.)*
==170==This news, I think, hath turn’d your weapon’s edge;
==171==’Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.

**GLOU.**
==172==Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart.
==173==Sorrow and grief have vanquish’d all my powers;
==174==And vanquish’d as I am, I yield to thee,
==175==Or to the meanest groom.

**KING.**
==176==O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
==177==Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!

**Q. MARG.**
==178==Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest,
==179==And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.

**GLOU.**
==180==Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,
==181==How I have lov’d my king and commonweal;
==182==And for my wife, I know not how it stands.
==183==Sorry I am to hear what I have heard.
==184==Noble she is; but if she have forgot
==185==Honor and virtue, and convers’d with such
==186==As, like to pitch, defile nobility,
==187==I banish her my bed and company,
==188==And give her as a prey to law and shame,
==189==That hath dishonored Gloucester’s honest name.

**KING.**
==190==Well, for this night we will repose us here;
==191==Tomorrow toward London back again,
==192==To look into this business thoroughly,
==193==And call these foul offenders to their answers,
==194==And poise the cause in justice’ equal scales,
==195==Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
