## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*London. A room in Gloucester’s house.*

*Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and his wife Eleanor the Duchess.*

**DUCH.**
==1==Why droops my lord, like over-ripen’d corn
==2==Hanging the head at Ceres’ plenteous load?
==3==Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,
==4==As frowning at the favors of the world?
==5==Why are thine eyes fix’d to the sullen earth,
==6==Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
==7==What seest thou there? King Henry’s diadem,
==8==Enchas’d with all the honors of the world?
==9==If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
==10==Until thy head be circled with the same.
==11==Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.
==12==What, is’t too short? I’ll lengthen it with mine,
==13==And having both together heav’d it up,
==14==We’ll both together lift our heads to heaven,
==15==And never more abase our sight so low
==16==As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.

**GLOU.**
==17==O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
==18==Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts!
==19==And may that thought, when I imagine ill
==20==Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,
==21==Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
==22==My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad.

**DUCH.**
==23==What dream’d my lord? Tell me, and I’ll requite it
==24==With sweet rehearsal of my morning’s dream.

**GLOU.**
==25==Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
==26==Was broke in twain (by whom I have forgot,
==27==But, as I think, it was by th’ Cardinal),
==28==And on the pieces of the broken wand
==29==Were plac’d the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,
==30==And William de la Pole, first Duke of Suffolk.
==31==This was my dream, what it doth bode God knows.

**DUCH.**
==32==Tut, this was nothing but an argument
==33==That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester’s grove
==34==Shall lose his head for his presumption.
==35==But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:
==36==Methought I sate in seat of majesty
==37==In the cathedral church of Westminster,
==38==And in that chair where kings and queens were crown’d,
==39==Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel’d to me,
==40==And on my head did set the diadem.

**GLOU.**
==41==Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright.
==42==Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtur’d Eleanor,
==43==Art thou not second woman in the realm?
==44==And the Protector’s wife, belov’d of him?
==45==Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command
==46==Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
==47==And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,
==48==To tumble down thy husband and thyself
==49==From top of honor to disgrace’s feet?
==50==Away from me, and let me hear no more!

**DUCH.**
==51==What, what, my lord? Are you so choleric
==52==With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?
==53==Next time I’ll keep my dreams unto myself,
==54==And not be check’d.

**GLOU.**
==55==Nay, be not angry, I am pleas’d again.

*Enter Messenger.*

**1. ROYAL MESS.**
==56==My Lord Protector, ’tis his Highness’ pleasure
==57==You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans,
==58==Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk.

**GLOU.**
==59==I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?

**DUCH.**
==60==Yes, my good lord, I’ll follow presently.
*(Exit Humphrey with Messenger.)*
==61==Follow I must, I cannot go before
==62==While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
==63==Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,
==64==I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks,
==65==And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
==66==And, being a woman, I will not be slack
==67==To play my part in Fortune’s pageant.
==68==Where are you there? Sir John! Nay, fear not, man,
==69==We are alone, here’s none but thee and I.

*Enter Hume.*

**HUME.**
==70==Jesus preserve your royal Majesty!

**DUCH.**
==71==What say’st thou? Majesty? I am but Grace.

**HUME.**
==72==But, by the grace of God and Hume’s advice,
==73==Your Grace’s title shall be multiplied.

**DUCH.**
==74==What say’st thou, man? Hast thou as yet conferr’d
==75==With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,
==76==With Roger Bolingbrook, the conjurer?
==77==And will they undertake to do me good?

**HUME.**
==78==This they have promised, to show your Highness
==79==A spirit rais’d from depth of under ground,
==80==That shall make answer to such questions
==81==As by your Grace shall be propounded him.

**DUCH.**
==82==It is enough, I’ll think upon the questions.
==83==When from Saint Albans we do make return,
==84==We’ll see these things effected to the full.
==85==Here, Hume, take this reward. Make merry, man,
==86==With thy confederates in this weighty cause.

*Exit Eleanor.*

**HUME.**
==87==Hume must make merry with the Duchess’ gold;
==88==Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume?
==89==Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum;
==90==The business asketh silent secrecy.
==91==Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch;
==92==Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.
==93==Yet have I gold flies from another coast⁠—
==94==I dare not say from the rich Cardinal
==95==And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk;
==96==Yet I do find it so; for, to be plain,
==97==They, knowing Dame Eleanor’s aspiring humor,
==98==Have hired me to undermine the Duchess,
==99==And buzz these conjurations in her brain.
==100==They say, “A crafty knave does need no broker,”
==101==Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal’s broker.
==102==Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
==103==To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
==104==Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last
==105==Hume’s knavery will be the Duchess’ wrack,
==106==And her attainture will be Humphrey’s fall.
==107==Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.

*Exit.*
