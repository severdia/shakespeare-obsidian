## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Bury Saint Edmunds. A palace room of state.*

*Enter two or three Murderers running over the stage, from the murder of Duke Humphrey.*

**1. MUR.**
==1==Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know
==2==We have dispatch’d the Duke, as he commanded.

**2. MUR.**
==3==O that it were to do! What have we done?
==4==Didst ever hear a man so penitent?

*Enter Suffolk.*

**1. MUR.**
==5==Here comes my lord.

**SUF.**
==6==Now, sirs, have you dispatch’d this thing?

**1. MUR.**
==7==Ay, my good lord, he’s dead.

**SUF.**
==8==Why, that’s well said. Go, get you to my house,
==9==I will reward you for this venturous deed.
==10==The King and all the peers are here at hand.
==11==Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,
==12==According as I gave directions?

**1. MUR.**
==13==’Tis, my good lord.

**SUF.**
==14==Away, be gone.

*Exeunt.*

*Sound trumpets. Enter the King, the Queen, Cardinal, Suffolk, Somerset, with Attendants.*

**KING.**
==15==Go call our uncle to our presence straight.
==16==Say we intend to try his Grace today,
==17==If he be guilty, as ’tis published.

**SUF.**
==18==I’ll call him presently, my noble lord.

*Exit.*

**KING.**
==19==Lords, take your places; and I pray you all
==20==Proceed no straiter ’gainst our uncle Gloucester
==21==Than from true evidence of good esteem
==22==He be approv’d in practice culpable.

**Q. MARG.**
==23==God forbid any malice should prevail,
==24==That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
==25==Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!

**KING.**
==26==I thank thee, Meg, these words content me much.
*(Enter Suffolk.)*
==27==How now? Why look’st thou pale? Why tremblest thou?
==28==Where is our uncle? What’s the matter, Suffolk?

**SUF.**
==29==Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.

**Q. MARG.**
==30==Marry, God forfend!

**CAR.**
==31==God’s secret judgment. I did dream tonight
==32==The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word.

*King sounds.*

**Q. MARG.**
==33==How fares my lord? Help, lords, the King is dead.

**SOM.**
==34==Rear up his body, wring him by the nose.

**Q. MARG.**
==35==Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!

**SUF.**
==36==He doth revive again. Madam, be patient.

**KING.**
==37==O heavenly God!

**Q. MARG.**
==37==           How fares my gracious lord?

**SUF.**
==38==Comfort, my sovereign! Gracious Henry, comfort!

**KING.**
==39==What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
==40==Came he right now to sing a raven’s note,
==41==Whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow’rs;
==42==And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
==43==By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
==44==Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
==45==Hide not thy poison with such sug’red words.
==46==Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say!
==47==Their touch affrights me as a serpent’s sting.
==48==Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
==49==Upon thy eyeballs murderous tyranny
==50==Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.
==51==Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding.
==52==Yet do not go away. Come, basilisk,
==53==And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
==54==For in the shade of death I shall find joy;
==55==In life but double death, now Gloucester’s dead.

**Q. MARG.**
==56==Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
==57==Although the Duke was enemy to him,
==58==Yet he most Christian-like laments his death;
==59==And for myself, foe as he was to me,
==60==Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
==61==Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,
==62==I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
==63==Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
==64==And all to have the noble Duke alive.
==65==What know I how the world may deem of me,
==66==For it is known we were but hollow friends?
==67==It may be judg’d I made the Duke away,
==68==So shall my name with slander’s tongue be wounded,
==69==And princes’ courts be fill’d with my reproach.
==70==This get I by his death. Ay me, unhappy,
==71==To be a queen, and crown’d with infamy!

**KING.**
==72==Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!

**Q. MARG.**
==73==Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
==74==What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
==75==I am no loathsome leper, look on me.
==76==What? Art thou like the adder waxen deaf?
==77==Be poisonous too, and kill thy forlorn queen.
==78==Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester’s tomb?
==79==Why then Dame Margaret was ne’er thy joy.
==80==Erect his statue and worship it,
==81==And make my image but an alehouse sign.
==82==Was I for this nigh wrack’d upon the sea,
==83==And twice by awkward wind from England’s bank
==84==Drove back again unto my native clime?
==85==What boded this, but well forewarning wind
==86==Did seem to say, “Seek not a scorpion’s nest,
==87==Nor set no footing on this unkind shore”?
==88==What did I then, but curs’d the gentle gusts,
==89==And he that loos’d them forth their brazen caves,
==90==And bid them blow towards England’s blessed shore,
==91==Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock?
==92==Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,
==93==But left that hateful office unto thee.
==94==The pretty vaulting sea refus’d to drown me,
==95==Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown’d on shore
==96==With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness.
==97==The splitting rocks cow’r’d in the sinking sands,
==98==And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
==99==Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
==100==Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
==101==As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
==102==When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
==103==I stood upon the hatches in the storm;
==104==And when the dusky sky began to rob
==105==My earnest-gaping sight of thy land’s view,
==106==I took a costly jewel from my neck,
==107==A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
==108==And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv’d it,
==109==And so I wish’d thy body might my heart.
==110==And even with this I lost fair England’s view,
==111==And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,
==112==And call’d them blind and dusky spectacles,
==113==For losing ken of Albion’s wished coast.
==114==How often have I tempted Suffolk’s tongue
==115==(The agent of thy foul inconstancy) 
==116==To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
==117==When he to madding Dido would unfold
==118==His father’s acts commenc’d in burning Troy!
==119==Am I not witch’d like her? Or thou not false like him?
==120==Ay me, I can no more! Die, Margaret!
==121==For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.

*Noise within. Enter Warwick, Salisbury, and many Commons.*

**WAR.**
==122==It is reported, mighty sovereign,
==123==That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd’red
==124==By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beauford’s means.
==125==The commons, like an angry hive of bees
==126==That want their leader, scatter up and down,
==127==And care not who they sting in his revenge.
==128==Myself have calm’d their spleenful mutiny,
==129==Until they hear the order of his death.

**KING.**
==130==That he is dead, good Warwick, ’tis too true,
==131==But how he died God knows, not Henry.
==132==Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,
==133==And comment then upon his sudden death.

**WAR.**
==134==That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,
==135==With the rude multitude till I return.

*Exit Warwick; then Salisbury with the Commons.*

**KING.**
==136==O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,
==137==My thoughts that labor to persuade my soul
==138==Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey’s life!
==139==If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,
==140==For judgment only doth belong to thee.
==141==Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
==142==With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain
==143==Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
==144==To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,
==145==And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling.
==146==But all in vain are these mean obsequies,
*(Bed put forth with the body of Gloucester in it.)*
*(Enter Warwick.)*
==147==And to survey his dead and earthy image,
==148==What were it but to make my sorrow greater?

**WAR.**
==149==Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.

**KING.**
==150==That is to see how deep my grave is made,
==151==For with his soul fled all my worldly solace;
==152==For seeing him, I see my life in death.

**WAR.**
==153==As surely as my soul intends to live
==154==With that dread King that took our state upon him,
==155==To free us from his Father’s wrathful curse,
==156==I do believe that violent hands were laid
==157==Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.

**SUF.**
==158==A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
==159==What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?

**WAR.**
==160==See how the blood is settled in his face.
==161==Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
==162==Of ashy semblance, meager, pale, and bloodless,
==163==Being all descended to the laboring heart,
==164==Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,
==165==Attracts the same for aidance ’gainst the enemy,
==166==Which with the heart there cools and ne’er returneth
==167==To blush and beautify the cheek again.
==168==But see, his face is black and full of blood,
==169==His eyeballs further out than when he lived,
==170==Staring full ghastly, like a strangled man;
==171==His hair uprear’d, his nostrils stretch’d with struggling;
==172==His hands abroad display’d, as one that grasp’d
==173==And tugg’d for life, and was by strength subdu’d.
==174==Look, on the sheets his hair, you see, is sticking,
==175==His well-proportion’d beard made rough and rugged,
==176==Like to the summer’s corn by tempest lodged.
==177==It cannot be but he was murd’red here,
==178==The least of all these signs were probable.

**SUF.**
==179==Why, Warwick, who should do the Duke to death?
==180==Myself and Beauford had him in protection,
==181==And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.

**WAR.**
==182==But both of you were vowed Duke Humphrey’s foes,
==183==And you
*(To Cardinal.)*
==183==    forsooth, had the good Duke to keep.
==184==’Tis like you would not feast him like a friend,
==185==And ’tis well seen he found an enemy.

**Q. MARG.**
==186==Then you belike suspect these noblemen
==187==As guilty of Duke Humphrey’s timeless death.

**WAR.**
==188==Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh,
==189==And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,
==190==But will suspect ’twas he that made the slaughter?
==191==Who finds the partridge in the puttock’s nest
==192==But may imagine how the bird was dead,
==193==Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
==194==Even so suspicious is this tragedy.

**Q. MARG.**
==195==Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where’s your knife?
==196==Is Beauford term’d a kite? Where are his talons?

**SUF.**
==197==I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men,
==198==But here’s a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
==199==That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
==200==That slanders me with murder’s crimson badge.
==201==Say, if thou dar’st, proud Lord of Warwickshire,
==202==That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey’s death.

*Exeunt Cardinal, Somerset, and others.*

**WAR.**
==203==What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?

**Q. MARG.**
==204==He dares not calm his contumelious spirit,
==205==Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,
==206==Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.

**WAR.**
==207==Madam, be still—with reverence may I say⁠—
==208==For every word you speak in his behalf
==209==Is slander to your royal dignity.

**SUF.**
==210==Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!
==211==If ever lady wrong’d her lord so much,
==212==Thy mother took into her blameful bed
==213==Some stern untutor’d churl; and noble stock
==214==Was graft with crab-tree slip, whose fruit thou art
==215==And never of the Nevils’ noble race.

**WAR.**
==216==But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee,
==217==And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,
==218==Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
==219==And that my sovereign’s presence makes me mild,
==220==I would, false murd’rous coward, on thy knee
==221==Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,
==222==And say it was thy mother that thou meant’st,
==223==That thou thyself wast born in bastardy;
==224==And after all this fearful homage done,
==225==Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,
==226==Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!

**SUF.**
==227==Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood,
==228==If from this presence thou dar’st go with me.

**WAR.**
==229==Away even now, or I will drag thee hence.
==230==Unworthy though thou art, I’ll cope with thee,
==231==And do some service to Duke Humphrey’s ghost.

*Exeunt Suffolk and Warwick.*

**KING.**
==232==What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
==233==Thrice is he arm’d that hath his quarrel just;
==234==And he but naked, though lock’d up in steel,
==235==Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.

*A noise within.*

**Q. MARG.**
==236==What noise is this?

*Enter Suffolk and Warwick with their weapons drawn.*

**KING.**
==237==Why, how now, lords? Your wrathful weapons drawn
==238==Here in our presence? Dare you be so bold?
==239==Why, what tumultuous clamor have we here?

**SUF.**
==240==The trait’rous Warwick, with the men of Bury,
==241==Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.

*Enter Salisbury.*

**SAL.**
*(To the Commons within.)*
==242==Sirs, stand apart, the King shall know your mind.⁠—
==243==Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,
==244==Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
==245==Or banished fair England’s territories,
==246==They will by violence tear him from your palace,
==247==And torture him with grievous ling’ring death.
==248==They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
==249==They say, in him they fear your Highness’ death;
==250==And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
==251==Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
==252==As being thought to contradict your liking,
==253==Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
==254==They say, in care of your most royal person,
==255==That if your Highness should intend to sleep,
==256==And charge that no man should disturb your rest
==257==In pain of your dislike, or pain of death,
==258==Yet notwithstanding such a strait edict,
==259==Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,
==260==That slyly glided towards your Majesty,
==261==It were but necessary you were wak’d,
==262==Lest being suffer’d in that harmful slumber,
==263==The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal.
==264==And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
==265==That they will guard you, whe’er you will or no,
==266==From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is;
==267==With whose envenomed and fatal sting,
==268==Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
==269==They say is shamefully bereft of life.

**1. COMMON.**
*(Within.)*
==270==An answer from the King, my Lord of Salisbury!

**SUF.**
==271==’Tis like the commons, rude unpolish’d hinds,
==272==Could send such message to their sovereign.
==273==But you, my lord, were glad to be employ’d,
==274==To show how quaint an orator you are;
==275==But all the honor Salisbury hath won
==276==Is, that he was the lord ambassador
==277==Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King.

**1. COMMON.**
*(Within.)*
==278==An answer from the King, or we will all break in!

**KING.**
==279==Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me,
==280==I thank them for their tender loving care;
==281==And had I not been cited so by them,
==282==Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;
==283==For sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy
==284==Mischance unto my state by Suffolk’s means.
==285==And therefore by His majesty I swear,
==286==Whose far-unworthy deputy I am,
==287==He shall not breathe infection in this air
==288==But three days longer, on the pain of death.

*Exit Salisbury.*

**Q. MARG.**
==289==O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!

**KING.**
==290==Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
==291==No more, I say! If thou dost plead for him,
==292==Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
==293==Had I but said, I would have kept my word;
==294==But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
==295==If after three days’ space thou here be’st found
==296==On any ground that I am ruler of,
==297==The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
==298==Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me,
==299==I have great matters to impart to thee.

*Exit with Warwick.*

**Q. MARG.**
==300==Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
==301==Heart’s discontent and sour affliction
==302==Be playfellows to keep you company!
==303==There’s two of you, the devil make a third,
==304==And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!

**SUF.**
==305==Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,
==306==And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.

**Q. MARG.**
==307==Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!
==308==Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?

**SUF.**
==309==A plague upon them! Wherefore should I curse them?
==310==Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake’s groan,
==311==I would invent as bitter searching terms,
==312==As curst, as harsh, and horrible to hear,
==313==Deliver’d strongly through my fixed teeth,
==314==With full as many signs of deadly hate,
==315==As lean-fac’d Envy in her loathsome cave.
==316==My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words,
==317==Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint,
==318==Mine hair be fix’d an end, as one distract;
==319==Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban;
==320==And even now my burden’d heart would break,
==321==Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
==322==Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
==323==Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
==324==Their chiefest prospect murd’ring basilisks!
==325==Their softest touch as smart as lizards’ stings!
==326==Their music frightful as the serpent’s hiss,
==327==And boding screech owls make the consort full!
==328==All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell⁠—

**Q. MARG.**
==329==Enough, sweet Suffolk, thou torment’st thyself,
==330==And these dread curses, like the sun ’gainst glass,
==331==Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,
==332==And turns the force of them upon thyself.

**SUF.**
==333==You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
==334==Now by the ground that I am banish’d from,
==335==Well could I curse away a winter’s night,
==336==Though standing naked on a mountain top,
==337==Where biting cold would never let grass grow,
==338==And think it but a minute spent in sport.

**Q. MARG.**
==339==O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,
==340==That I may dew it with my mournful tears;
==341==Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place
==342==To wash away my woeful monuments.
==343==O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
==344==That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
==345==Through whom a thousand sighs are breath’d for thee!
==346==So get thee gone, that I may know my grief,
==347==’Tis but surmis’d whiles thou art standing by,
==348==As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
==349==I will repeal thee, or, be well assur’d,
==350==Adventure to be banished myself;
==351==And banished I am, if but from thee.
==352==Go, speak not to me; even now be gone.
==353==O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn’d
==354==Embrace, and kiss, and take ten thousand leaves,
==355==Loather a hundred times to part than die.
==356==Yet now farewell, and farewell life with thee!

**SUF.**
==357==Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished,
==358==Once by the King, and three times thrice by thee.
==359==’Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
==360==A wilderness is populous enough,
==361==So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:
==362==For where thou art, there is the world itself,
==363==With every several pleasure in the world;
==364==And where thou art not, desolation.
==365==I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;
==366==Myself no joy in nought but that thou liv’st.

*Enter Vaux.*

**Q. MARG.**
==367==Whither goes Vaux so fast? What news, I prithee?

**VAUX.**
==368==To signify unto his Majesty
==369==That Cardinal Beauford is at point of death;
==370==For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,
==371==That makes him gasp, and stare, and catch the air,
==372==Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.
==373==Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey’s ghost
==374==Were by his side; sometime he calls the King,
==375==And whispers to his pillow as to him
==376==The secrets of his overcharged soul;
==377==And I am sent to tell his Majesty
==378==That even now he cries aloud for him.

**Q. MARG.**
==379==Go tell this heavy message to the King.
*(Exit Vaux.)*
==380==Ay me! What is this world! What news are these!
==381==But wherefore grieve I at an hour’s poor loss,
==382==Omitting Suffolk’s exile, my soul’s treasure?
==383==Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,
==384==And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
==385==Theirs for the earth’s increase, mine for my sorrows?
==386==Now get thee hence, the King, thou know’st, is coming.
==387==If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.

**SUF.**
==388==If I depart from thee, I cannot live,
==389==And in thy sight to die, what were it else
==390==But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
==391==Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
==392==As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe
==393==Dying with mother’s dug between its lips;
==394==Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
==395==And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
==396==To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;
==397==So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
==398==Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
==399==And then it liv’d in sweet Elysium.
==400==To die by thee were but to die in jest,
==401==From thee to die were torture more than death.
==402==O, let me stay, befall what may befall!

**Q. MARG.**
==403==Away! Though parting be a fretful corrosive,
==404==It is applied to a deathful wound.
==405==To France, sweet Suffolk! Let me hear from thee;
==406==For wheresoe’er thou art in this world’s globe,
==407==I’ll have an Iris that shall find thee out.

**SUF.**
==408==I go.

**Q. MARG.**
==408==    And take my heart with thee.

*She kisseth him.*

**SUF.**
==409==A jewel, lock’d into the woefull’st cask
==410==That ever did contain a thing of worth.
==411==Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we;
==412==This way fall I to death.

**Q. MARG.**
==412==              This way for me.

*Exeunt severally.*
