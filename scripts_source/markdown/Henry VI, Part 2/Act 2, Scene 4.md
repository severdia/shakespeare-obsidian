## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*London. A street.*

*Enter Duke Humphrey of Gloucester and his Attendants in mourning cloaks.*

**GLOU.**
==1==Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud,
==2==And after summer evermore succeeds
==3==Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold;
==4==So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.
==5==Sirs, what’s o’clock?

**GLOU. 1. ATT.**
==5==           Ten, my lord.

**GLOU.**
==6==Ten is the hour that was appointed me
==7==To watch the coming of my punish’d duchess.
==8==Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
==9==To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.
==10==Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
==11==The abject people gazing on thy face,
==12==With envious looks laughing at thy shame,
==13==That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
==14==When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
==15==But soft, I think she comes, and I’ll prepare
==16==My tear-stain’d eyes to see her miseries.

*Enter the Duchess of Gloucester, barefoot, in a white sheet, and verses written on her back and""pinned on, and a taper burning in her hand, with Sir John Stanley, the Sheriff, and Officers.*

**GLOU. 2. ATT.**
==17==So please your Grace, we’ll take her from the sheriff.

**GLOU.**
==18==No, stir not for your lives, let her pass by.

**DUCH.**
==19==Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
==20==Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
==21==See how the giddy multitude do point
==22==And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!
==23==Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,
==24==And in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,
==25==And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine.

**GLOU.**
==26==Be patient, gentle Nell, forget this grief.

**DUCH.**
==27==Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself;
==28==For whilest I think I am thy married wife,
==29==And thou a prince, Protector of this land,
==30==Methinks I should not thus be led along,
==31==Mail’d up in shame, with papers on my back,
==32==And follow’d with a rabble that rejoice
==33==To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
==34==The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
==35==And when I start, the envious people laugh,
==36==And bid me be advised how I tread.
==37==Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
==38==Trowest thou that e’er I’ll look upon the world,
==39==Or count them happy that enjoys the sun?
==40==No; dark shall be my light, and night my day;
==41==To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
==42==Sometime I’ll say, I am Duke Humphrey’s wife,
==43==And he a prince, and ruler of the land;
==44==Yet so he rul’d, and such a prince he was,
==45==As he stood by, whilest I, his forlorn duchess,
==46==Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
==47==To every idle rascal follower.
==48==But be thou mild, and blush not at my shame,
==49==Nor stir at nothing, till the axe of death
==50==Hang over thee, as sure it shortly will;
==51==For Suffolk, he that can do all in all
==52==With her that hateth thee and hates us all,
==53==And York and impious Beauford, that false priest,
==54==Have all lim’d bushes to betray thy wings,
==55==And fly thou how thou canst, they’ll tangle thee.
==56==But fear not thou, until thy foot be snar’d,
==57==Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.

**GLOU.**
==58==Ah, Nell, forbear! Thou aimest all awry.
==59==I must offend before I be attainted;
==60==And had I twenty times so many foes,
==61==And each of them had twenty times their power,
==62==All these could not procure me any scathe
==63==So long as I am loyal, true, and crimeless.
==64==Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
==65==Why, yet thy scandal were not wip’d away,
==66==But I in danger for the breach of law.
==67==Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell.
==68==I pray thee sort thy heart to patience,
==69==These few days’ wonder will be quickly worn.

*Enter a Herald.*

**HER.**
==70==I summon your Grace to his Majesty’s parliament,
==71==Holden at Bury the first of this next month.

**GLOU.**
==72==And my consent ne’er ask’d herein before?
==73==This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.
*(Exit Herald.)*
==74==My Nell, I take my leave; and, Master Sheriff,
==75==Let not her penance exceed the King’s commission.

**SHER. LOND.**
==76==And’t please your Grace, here my commission stays;
==77==And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
==78==To take her with him to the Isle of Man.

**GLOU.**
==79==Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?

**STAN.**
==80==So am I given in charge, may’t please your Grace.

**GLOU.**
==81==Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
==82==You use her well. The world may laugh again,
==83==And I may live to do you kindness if
==84==You do it her. And so, Sir John, farewell!

**DUCH.**
==85==What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell?

**GLOU.**
==86==Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.

*Exit Gloucester with his Men.*

**DUCH.**
==87==Art thou gone too? All comfort go with thee,
==88==For none abides with me. My joy is death;
==89==Death, at whose name I oft have been afeard,
==90==Because I wish’d this world’s eternity.
==91==Stanley, I prithee go, and take me hence,
==92==I care not whither, for I beg no favor;
==93==Only convey me where thou art commanded.

**STAN.**
==94==Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man,
==95==There to be us’d according to your state.

**DUCH.**
==96==That’s bad enough, for I am but reproach;
==97==And shall I then be us’d reproachfully?

**STAN.**
==98==Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey’s lady,
==99==According to that state you shall be us’d.

**DUCH.**
==100==Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,
==101==Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.

**SHER. LOND.**
==102==It is my office, and, madam, pardon me.

**DUCH.**
==103==Ay, ay, farewell, thy office is discharg’d.
==104==Come, Stanley, shall we go?

**STAN.**
==105==Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
==106==And go we to attire you for our journey.

**DUCH.**
==107==My shame will not be shifted with my sheet.
==108==No, it will hang upon my richest robes,
==109==And show itself, attire me how I can.
==110==Go, lead the way, I long to see my prison.

*Exeunt.*
