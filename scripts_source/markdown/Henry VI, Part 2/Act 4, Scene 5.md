[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*London. The Tower.*

*Enter Lord Scales upon the Tower, walking. Then enters two or three Citizens below.*

**SCALES.**
==1==How now? Is Jack Cade slain?

**1. LOND. CIT.**
==2==No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have won the Bridge, killing all those that withstand them. The Lord Mayor craves aid of your honor from the Tower to defend the city from the rebels.

**SCALES.**
==3==Such aid as I can spare you shall command,
==4==But I am troubled here with them myself;
==5==The rebels have assay’d to win the Tower.
==6==But get you to Smithfield and gather head,
==7==And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe.
==8==Fight for your king, your country, and your lives,
==9==And so farewell, for I must hence again.

*Exeunt.*
