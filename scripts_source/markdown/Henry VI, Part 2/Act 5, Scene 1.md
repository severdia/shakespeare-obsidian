## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 10|← Act 4, Scene 10]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.*

*Enter York and his army of Irish with Drum and Colors.*

**YORK.**
==1== From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
==2== And pluck the crown from feeble Henry’s head.
==3== Ring bells, aloud, burn bonfires clear and bright
==4== To entertain great England’s lawful king!
==5== Ah, *sancta majestas*! Who would not buy thee dear?
==6== Let them obey that knows not how to rule;
==7== This hand was made to handle nought but gold.
==8== I cannot give due action to my words,
==9== Except a sword or scepter balance it.
==10== A scepter shall it have, have I a soul,
==11== On which I’ll toss the flow’r-de-luce of France.
*(Enter Buckingham.)*
==12== Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?
==13== The King hath sent him sure; I must dissemble.

**BUCK.**
==14== York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.

**YORK.**
==15== Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
==16== Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?

**BUCK.**
==17== A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,
==18== To know the reason of these arms in peace;
==19== Or why thou, being a subject as I am,
==20== Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,
==21== Should raise so great a power without his leave,
==22== Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.

**YORK.**
*(Aside.)*
==23== Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great.
==24== O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
==25== I am so angry at these abject terms;
==26== And now, like Ajax Telamonius,
==27== On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
==28== I am far better born than is the King;
==29== More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts;
==30== But I must make fair weather yet a while,
==31== Till Henry be more weak and I more strong.⁠—
==32== Buckingham, I prithee pardon me,
==33== That I have given no answer all this while;
==34== My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
==35== The cause why I have brought this army hither
==36== Is to remove proud Somerset from the King,
==37== Seditious to his Grace and to the state.

**BUCK.**
==38== That is too much presumption on thy part;
==39== But if thy arms be to no other end,
==40== The King hath yielded unto thy demand:
==41== The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.

**YORK.**
==42== Upon thine honor, is he prisoner?

**BUCK.**
==43== Upon mine honor, he is prisoner.

**YORK.**
==44== Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my pow’rs.
==45== Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves.
==46== Meet me tomorrow in Saint George’s Field,
==47== You shall have pay and every thing you wish.
*(Exeunt Soldiers.)*
==48== And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,
==49== Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
==50== As pledges of my fealty and love;
==51== I’ll send them all as willing as I live.
==52== Lands, goods, horse, armor, any thing I have
==53== Is his to use, so Somerset may die.

**BUCK.**
==54== York, I commend this kind submission;
==55== We twain will go into his Highness’ tent.

*Enter King and Attendants.*

**KING.**
==56== Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us
==57== That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?

**YORK.**
==58== In all submission and humility
==59== York doth present himself unto your Highness.

**KING.**
==60== Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?

**YORK.**
==61== To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
==62== And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,
==63== Who since I heard to be discomfited.

*Enter Iden with Cade’s head.*

**IDEN.**
==64== If one so rude and of so mean condition
==65== May pass into the presence of a king,
==66== Lo, I present your Grace a traitor’s head,
==67== The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.

**KING.**
==68== The head of Cade! Great God, how just art thou!
==69== O, let me view his visage, being dead,
==70== That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.
==71== Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?

**IDEN.**
==72== I was, an’t like your Majesty.

**KING.**
==73== How art thou call’d? And what is thy degree?

**IDEN.**
==74== Alexander Iden, that’s my name,
==75== A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.

**BUCK.**
==76== So please it you, my lord, ’twere not amiss
==77== He were created knight for his good service.

**KING.**
==78== Iden, kneel down.
*(He kneels.)*
==78==            Rise up a knight.
==79== We give thee for reward a thousand marks,
==80== And will that thou henceforth attend on us.

**IDEN.**
==81== May Iden live to merit such a bounty,
==82== And never live but true unto his liege!

*Rises.*

*Enter Queen and Somerset.*

**KING.**
==83== See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with th’ Queen.
==84== Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke.

**Q. MARG.**
==85== For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,
==86== But boldly stand and front him to his face.

**YORK.**
==87== How now? Is Somerset at liberty?
==88== Then, York, unloose thy long-imprisoned thoughts,
==89== And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
==90== Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
==91== False king, why hast thou broken faith with me,
==92== Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
==93== King did I call thee? No; thou art not king;
==94== Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
==95== Which dar’st not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
==96== That head of thine doth not become a crown:
==97== Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer’s staff
==98== And not to grace an aweful princely scepter.
==99== That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
==100== Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles’ spear,
==101== Is able with the change to kill and cure.
==102== Here is a hand to hold a scepter up,
==103== And with the same to act controlling laws.
==104== Give place! By heaven, thou shalt rule no more
==105== O’er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.

**SOM.**
==106== O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
==107== Of capital treason ’gainst the King and crown.
==108== Obey, audacious traitor, kneel for grace.

**YORK.**
==109== Wouldst have me kneel? First let me ask of these
==110== If they can brook I bow a knee to man.
==111== Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail.
*(Exit Attendant.)*
==112== I know, ere they will have me go to ward,
==113== They’ll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.

**Q. MARG.**
==114== Call hither Clifford, bid him come amain,
==115== To say if that the bastard boys of York
==116== Shall be the surety for their traitor father.

*Exit Buckingham.*

**YORK.**
==117== O blood-bespotted Neapolitan,
==118== Outcast of Naples, England’s bloody scourge!
==119== The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,
==120== Shall be their father’s bail, and bane to those
==121== That for my surety will refuse the boys!
*(Enter Edward and Richard Plantagenet with Drum and Soldiers at one door.)*
==122== See where they come, I’ll warrant they’ll make it good.

*Enter Clifford and his son Young Clifford with Drum and Soldiers at the other door.*

**Q. MARG.**
==123== And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.

**CLIF.**
==124== Health and all happiness to my lord the King!

*Kneels.*

**YORK.**
==125== I thank thee, Clifford. Say, what news with thee?
==126== Nay, do not fright us with an angry look.
==127== We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;
==128== For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.

**CLIF.**
==129== This is my king, York, I do not mistake,
==130== But thou mistakes me much to think I do.
==131== To Bedlam with him! Is the man grown mad?

**KING.**
==132== Ay, Clifford, a bedlam and ambitious humor
==133== Makes him oppose himself against his king.

**CLIF.**
==134== He is a traitor, let him to the Tower,
==135== And chop away that factious pate of his.

**Q. MARG.**
==136== He is arrested, but will not obey.
==137== His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.

**YORK.**
==138== Will you not, sons?

**EDW.**
==139== Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.

**RICH.**
==140== And if words will not, then our weapons shall.

**CLIF.**
==141== Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!

**YORK.**
==142== Look in a glass, and call thy image so.
==143== I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.
==144== Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,
==145== That with the very shaking of their chains
==146== They may astonish these fell-lurking curs.
==147== Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.

*Enter the Earls of Warwick and Salisbury with Drum and Soldiers.*

**CLIF.**
==148== Are these thy bears? We’ll bait thy bears to death,
==149== And manacle the bearard in their chains,
==150== If thou dar’st bring them to the baiting-place.

**RICH.**
==151== Oft have I seen a hot o’erweening cur
==152== Run back and bite, because he was withheld,
==153== Who, being suffer’d, with the bear’s fell paw
==154== Hath clapp’d his tail between his legs and cried;
==155== And such a piece of service will you do,
==156== If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.

**CLIF.**
==157== Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
==158== As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!

**YORK.**
==159== Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.

**CLIF.**
==160== Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.

**KING.**
==161== Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
==162== Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,
==163== Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!
==164== What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,
==165== And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
==166== O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
==167== If it be banish’d from the frosty head,
==168== Where shall it find a harbor in the earth?
==169== Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,
==170== And shame thine honorable age with blood?
==171== Why art thou old, and want’st experience?
==172== Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it?
==173== For shame, in duty bend thy knee to me
==174== That bows unto the grave with mickle age.

**SAL.**
==175== My lord, I have considered with myself
==176== The title of this most renowned duke,
==177== And in my conscience do repute his Grace
==178== The rightful heir to England’s royal seat.

**KING.**
==179== Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?

**SAL.**
==180== I have.

**KING.**
==181== Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?

**SAL.**
==182== It is great sin to swear unto a sin,
==183== But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.
==184== Who can be bound by any solemn vow
==185== To do a murd’rous deed, to rob a man,
==186== To force a spotless virgin’s chastity,
==187== To reave the orphan of his patrimony,
==188== To wring the widow from her custom’d right,
==189== And have no other reason for this wrong
==190== But that he was bound by a solemn oath?

**Q. MARG.**
==191== A subtle traitor needs no sophister.

**KING.**
==192== Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.

**YORK.**
==193== Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
==194== I am resolv’d for death or dignity.

**CLIF.**
==195== The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.

**WAR.**
==196== You were best to go to bed and dream again,
==197== To keep thee from the tempest of the field.

**CLIF.**
==198== I am resolv’d to bear a greater storm
==199== Than any thou canst conjure up today;
==200== And that I’ll write upon thy burgonet,
==201== Might I but know thee by thy household badge.

**WAR.**
==202== Now, by my father’s badge, old Nevil’s crest,
==203== The rampant bear chain’d to the ragged staff,
==204== This day I’ll wear aloft my burgonet,
==205== As on a mountain top the cedar shows
==206== That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
==207== Even to affright thee with the view thereof.

**CLIF.**
==208== And from thy burgonet I’ll rend thy bear,
==209== And tread it under foot with all contempt,
==210== Despite the bearard that protects the bear.

**Y. CLIF.**
==211== And so to arms, victorious father,
==212== To quell the rebels and their complices.

**RICH.**
==213== Fie! Charity, for shame! Speak not in spite,
==214== For you shall sup with Jesu Christ tonight.

**Y. CLIF.**
==215== Foul stigmatic, that’s more than thou canst tell.

**RICH.**
==216== If not in heaven, you’ll surely sup in hell.

*Exeunt severally.*
