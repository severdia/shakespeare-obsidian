## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Blackheath.*

*Enter George Bevis and John Holland with long staves.*

**BEVIS.**
==1==Come and get thee a sword, though made of a lath; they have been up these two days.

**HOLL.**
==2==They have the more need to sleep now, then.

**BEVIS.**
==3==I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.

**HOLL.**
==4==So he had need, for ’tis threadbare. Well, I say, it was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.

**BEVIS.**
==5==O miserable age! Virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.

**HOLL.**
==6==The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.

**BEVIS.**
==7==Nay more, the King’s Council are no good workmen.

**HOLL.**
==8==True; and yet it is said, labor in thy vocation; which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be laboring men; and therefore should we be magistrates.

**BEVIS.**
==9==Thou hast hit it; for there’s no better sign of a brave mind than a hard hand.

**HOLL.**
==10==I see them, I see them! There’s Best’s son, the tanner of Wingham⁠—

**BEVIS.**
==11==He shall have the skins of our enemies, to make dog’s-leather of.

**HOLL.**
==12==And Dick the butcher⁠—

**BEVIS.**
==13==Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity’s throat cut like a calf.

**HOLL.**
==14==And Smith the weaver⁠—

**BEVIS.**
==15==Argo, their thread of life is spun.

**HOLL.**
==16==Come, come, let’s fall in with them.

*Drum. Enter Cade, Dick butcher, Smith the weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers, with long staves.*

**CADE.**
==17==We John Cade, so term’d of our suppos’d father⁠—

**DICK.**
*(Aside.)*
==18==Or rather of stealing a cade of herrings.

**CADE.**
==19==For our enemies shall fall before us, inspir’d with the spirit of putting down kings and princes—command silence.

**DICK.**
==20==Silence!

**CADE.**
==21==My father was a Mortimer⁠—

**DICK.**
*(Aside.)*
==22==He was an honest man, and a good bricklayer.

**CADE.**
==23==My mother a Plantagenet⁠—

**DICK.**
*(Aside.)*
==24==I knew her well, she was a midwife.

**CADE.**
==25==My wife descended of the Lacies⁠—

**DICK.**
*(Aside.)*
==26==She was indeed a pedlar’s daughter, and sold many laces.

**SMITH.**
*(Aside.)*
==27==But now of late, not able to travel with her furr’d pack, she washes bucks here at home.

**CADE.**
==28==Therefore am I of an honorable house.

**DICK.**
*(Aside.)*
==29==Ay, by my faith, the field is honorable, and there was he born, under a hedge; for his father had never a house but the cage.

**CADE.**
==30==Valiant I am.

**SMITH.**
*(Aside.)*
==31==’A must needs, for beggary is valiant.

**CADE.**
==32==I am able to endure much.

**DICK.**
*(Aside.)*
==33==No question of that; for I have seen him whipt three market-days together.

**CADE.**
==34==I fear neither sword nor fire.

**SMITH.**
*(Aside.)*
==35==He need not fear the sword, for his coat is of proof.

**DICK.**
*(Aside.)*
==36==But methinks he should stand in fear of fire, being burnt i’ th’ hand for stealing of sheep.

**CADE.**
==37==Be brave then, for your captain is brave, and vows reformation. There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny; the three-hoop’d pot shall have ten hoops, and I will make it felony to drink small beer. All the realm shall be in common, and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass; and when I am king, as king I will be⁠—

**ALL.**
==38==God save your Majesty!

**CADE.**
==39==I thank you, good people—there shall be no money; all shall eat and drink on my score, and I will apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree like brothers, and worship me their lord.

**DICK.**
==40==The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.

**CADE.**
==41==Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? That parchment, being scribbled o’er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings, but I say, ’tis the bee’s wax; for I did but seal once to a thing, and I was never mine own man since. How now? Who’s there?

*Enter one with a Clerk.*

**SMITH.**
==42==The clerk of Chatham. He can write and read and cast accompt.

**CADE.**
==43==O monstrous!

**SMITH.**
==44==We took him setting of boys’ copies.

**CADE.**
==45==Here’s a villain!

**SMITH.**
==46==H’as a book in his pocket with red letters in’t.

**CADE.**
==47==Nay, then he is a conjurer.

**DICK.**
==48==Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.

**CADE.**
==49==I am sorry for’t. The man is a proper man, of mine honor; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die. Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee. What is thy name?

**CLERK. CHAT.**
==50==Emmanuel.

**DICK.**
==51==They use to write it on the top of letters; ’twill go hard with you.

**CADE.**
==52==Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? Or hast thou a mark to thyself, like a honest plain-dealing man?

**CLERK. CHAT.**
==53==Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up that I can write my name.

**ALL.**
==54==He hath confess’d! Away with him! He’s a villain and a traitor.

**CADE.**
==55==Away with him, I say! Hang him with his pen and inkhorn about his neck.

*Exit one with the Clerk of Chatham.*

*Enter Michael.*

**MICH.**
==56==Where’s our general?

**CADE.**
==57==Here I am, thou particular fellow.

**MICH.**
==58==Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother are hard by, with the King’s forces.

**CADE.**
==59==Stand, villain, stand, or I’ll fell thee down. He shall be encount’red with a man as good as himself. He is but a knight, is ’a?

**MICH.**
==60==No.

**CADE.**
==61==To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.
*(Kneels.)*
==62==Rise up Sir John Mortimer.
*(Rises.)*
==63==Now have at him!

*Enter Sir Humphrey Stafford and his Brother with Drum and Soldiers.*

**STAF.**
==64==Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
==65==Mark’d for the gallows, lay your weapons down,
==66==Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:
==67==The King is merciful, if you revolt.

**BRO.**
==68==But angry, wrathful, and inclin’d to blood,
==69==If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.

**CADE.**
==70==As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not,
==71==It is to you, good people, that I speak,
==72==Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign,
==73==For I am rightful heir unto the crown.

**STAF.**
==74==Villain, thy father was a plasterer,
==75==And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?

**CADE.**
==76==And Adam was a gardener.

**BRO.**
==77==And what of that?

**CADE.**
==78==Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March,
==79==Married the Duke of Clarence’ daughter, did he not?

**STAF.**
==80==Ay, sir.

**CADE.**
==81==By her he had two children at one birth.

**BRO.**
==82==That’s false.

**CADE.**
==83==Ay, there’s the question; but I say, ’tis true.
==84==The elder of them, being put to nurse,
==85==Was by a beggar-woman stol’n away,
==86==And ignorant of his birth and parentage,
==87==Became a bricklayer when he came to age.
==88==His son am I, deny it if you can.

**DICK.**
==89==Nay, ’tis too true; therefore he shall be king.

**SMITH.**
==90==Sir, he made a chimney in my father’s house, and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it; therefore deny it not.

**STAF.**
==91==And will you credit this base drudge’s words,
==92==That speaks he knows not what?

**ALL.**
==93==Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.

**BRO.**
==94==Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.

**CADE.**
*(Aside.)*
==95==He lies, for I invented it myself.—Go to, sirrah, tell the King from me, that, for his father’s sake, Henry the Fifth (in whose time boys went to span-counter for French crowns), I am content he shall reign, but I’ll be Protector over him.

**DICK.**
==96==And furthermore, we’ll have the Lord Say’s head for selling the dukedom of Maine.

**CADE.**
==97==And good reason; for thereby is England main’d, and fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch; and more than that, he can speak French, and therefore he is a traitor.

**STAF.**
==98==O gross and miserable ignorance!

**CADE.**
==99==Nay, answer if you can. The Frenchmen are our enemies. Go to then, I ask but this: can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor, or no?

**ALL.**
==100==No, no, and therefore we’ll have his head.

**BRO.**
==101==Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,
==102==Assail them with the army of the King.

**STAF.**
==103==Herald, away, and throughout every town
==104==Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade,
==105==That those which fly before the battle ends
==106==May, even in their wives’ and children’s sight,
==107==Be hang’d up for example at their doors.
==108==And you that be the King’s friends, follow me.

*Exit with his Brother and Men.*

**CADE.**
==109==And you that love the commons, follow me.
==110==Now show yourselves men, ’tis for liberty.
==111==We will not leave one lord, one gentleman;
==112==Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon,
==113==For they are thrifty honest men, and such
==114==As would (but that they dare not) take our parts.

**DICK.**
==115==They are all in order, and march toward us.

**CADE.**
==116==But then are we in order when we are most out of order. Come, march forward.

*Exeunt.*
