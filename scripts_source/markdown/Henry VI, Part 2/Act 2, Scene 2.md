## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*London. York’s garden.*

*Enter York, Salisbury, and Warwick.*

**YORK.**
==1==Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
==2==Our simple supper ended, give me leave
==3==In this close walk to satisfy myself
==4==In craving your opinion of my title,
==5==Which is infallible, to England’s crown.

**SAL.**
==6==My lord, I long to hear it at full.

**WAR.**
==7==Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,
==8==The Nevils are thy subjects to command.

**YORK.**
==9==Then thus:
==10==Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
==11==The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
==12==The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,
==13==Lionel Duke of Clarence; next to whom
==14==Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
==15==The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
==16==The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
==17==William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
==18==Edward the Black Prince died before his father,
==19==And left behind him Richard, his only son,
==20==Who after Edward the Third’s death reign’d as king
==21==Till Henry Bullingbrook, Duke of Lancaster,
==22==The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
==23==Crown’d by the name of Henry the Fourth,
==24==Seiz’d on the realm, depos’d the rightful king,
==25==Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
==26==And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,
==27==Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.

**WAR.**
==28==Father, the Duke hath told the truth;
==29==Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.

**YORK.**
==30==Which now they hold by force and not by right;
==31==For Richard, the first son’s heir, being dead,
==32==The issue of the next son should have reign’d.

**SAL.**
==33==But William of Hatfield died without an heir.

**YORK.**
==34==The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
==35==I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,
==36==Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;
==37==Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;
==38==Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.

**SAL.**
==39==This Edmund, in the reign of Bullingbrook,
==40==As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,
==41==And but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
==42==Who kept him in captivity till he died.
==43==But, to the rest.

**YORK.**
==44==His eldest sister, Anne,
==45==My mother, being heir unto the crown,
==46==Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was
==47==To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third’s fifth son, son.
==48==By her I claim the kingdom. She was heir
==49==To Roger Earl of March, who was the son
==50==Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,
==51==Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence;
==52==So, if the issue of the elder son
==53==Succeed before the younger, I am king.

**WAR.**
==54==What plain proceedings is more plain than this?
==55==Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
==56==The fourth son, York claims it from the third;
==57==Till Lionel’s issue fails, his should not reign.
==58==It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee,
==59==And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
==60==Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,
==61==And in this private plot be we the first
==62==That shall salute our rightful sovereign
==63==With honor of his birthright to the crown.

**BOTH WAR. AND SAL.**
==64==Long live our sovereign Richard, England’s king!

**YORK.**
==65==We thank you, lords. But I am not your king
==66==Till I be crown’d, and that my sword be stain’d
==67==With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
==68==And that’s not suddenly to be perform’d,
==69==But with advice and silent secrecy.
==70==Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
==71==Wink at the Duke of Suffolk’s insolence,
==72==At Beauford’s pride, at Somerset’s ambition,
==73==At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,
==74==Till they have snar’d the shepherd of the flock,
==75==That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey.
==76==’Tis that they seek; and they in seeking that
==77==Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.

**SAL.**
==78==My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.

**WAR.**
==79==My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
==80==Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.

**YORK.**
==81==And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,
==82==Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
==83==The greatest man in England but the King.

*Exeunt.*
