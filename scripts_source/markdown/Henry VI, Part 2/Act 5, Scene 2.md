## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Battlefield at Saint Albans.*

*Alarums to the battle. Enter Warwick.*

**WAR.**
==1==Clifford of Cumberland, ’tis Warwick calls!
==2==And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,
==3==Now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum,
==4==And dead men’s cries do fill the empty air,
==5==Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me.
==6==Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,
==7==Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
*(Enter York.)*
==8==How now, my noble lord? What, all afoot?

**YORK.**
==9==The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed;
==10==But match to match I have encount’red him,
==11==And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
==12==Even of the bonny beast he lov’d so well.

*Enter old Clifford.*

**WAR.**
==13==Of one or both of us the time is come.

**YORK.**
==14==Hold, Warwick; seek thee out some other chase,
==15==For I myself must hunt this deer to death.

**WAR.**
==16==Then nobly, York, ’tis for a crown thou fight’st.
==17==As I intend, Clifford, to thrive today,
==18==It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail’d.

*Exit Warwick.*

**CLIF.**
==19==What seest thou in me, York? Why dost thou pause?

**YORK.**
==20==With thy brave bearing should I be in love,
==21==But that thou art so fast mine enemy.

**CLIF.**
==22==Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
==23==But that ’tis shown ignobly and in treason.

**YORK.**
==24==So let it help me now against thy sword,
==25==As I in justice and true right express it.

**CLIF.**
==26==My soul and body on the action both!

**YORK.**
==27==A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.

*They fight, and Clifford falls.*

**CLIF.**
==28==*La fin couronne les oeuvres.*

*Dies.*

**YORK.**
==29==Thus war hath given thee peace, for thou art still.
==30==Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!

*Exit.*

*Enter Young Clifford.*

**Y. CLIF.**
==31==Shame and confusion! All is on the rout,
==32==Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds
==33==Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,
==34==Whom angry heavens do make their minister,
==35==Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
==36==Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
==37==He that is truly dedicate to war
==38==Hath no self-love; nor he that loves himself
==39==Hath not essentially but by circumstance
==40==The name of valor.
*(Sees his dead father.)*
==41==O, let the vile world end,
==42==And the premised flames of the last day
==43==Knit earth and heaven together!
==44==Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,
==45==Particularities and petty sounds
==46==To cease! Wast thou ordain’d, dear father,
==47==To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve
==48==The silver livery of advised age,
==49==And in thy reverence, and thy chair-days, thus
==50==To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
==51==My heart is turn’d to stone; and while ’tis mine,
==52==It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;
==53==No more will I their babes. Tears virginal
==54==Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,
==55==And beauty, that the tyrant oft reclaims,
==56==Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
==57==Henceforth I will not have to do with pity.
==58==Meet I an infant of the house of York,
==59==Into as many gobbets will I cut it
==60==As wild Medea young Absyrtus did;
==61==In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
*(He takes him up on his back.)*
==62==Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford’s house:
==63==As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,
==64==So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
==65==But then Aeneas bare a living load⁠—
==66==Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.

*Exit bearing off his father.*

*Enter Richard and Somerset to fight.*

*Somerset is killed under the sign of the Castle Inn.*

**RICH.**
==67==So lie thou there;
==68==For underneath an alehouse’ paltry sign,
==69==The Castle in Saint Albans, Somerset
==70==Hath made the wizard famous in his death.
==71==Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:
==72==Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.

*Exit.*

*Fight.*

*Excursions. Enter King, Queen, and others.*

**Q. MARG.**
==73==Away, my lord! You are slow, for shame, away!

**KING.**
==74==Can we outrun the heavens? Good Margaret, stay.

**Q. MARG.**
==75==What are you made of? You’ll nor fight nor fly.
==76==Now is it manhood, wisdom, and defense
==77==To give the enemy way, and to secure us
==78==By what we can, which can no more but fly.
*(Alarum afar off.)*
==79==If you be ta’en, we then should see the bottom
==80==Of all our fortunes; but if we haply scape
==81==(As well we may, if not through your neglect),
==82==We shall to London get, where you are lov’d,
==83==And where this breach now in our fortunes made
==84==May readily be stopp’d.

*Enter Young Clifford.*

**Y. CLIF.**
==85==But that my heart’s on future mischief set,
==86==I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly.
==87==But fly you must. Uncurable discomfit
==88==Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.
==89==Away, for your relief! And we will live
==90==To see their day, and them our fortune give.
==91==Away, my lord, away!

*Exeunt.*
