## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Coast of Kent. Seashore near Dover.*

*Alarum within. Ord’nance goes off like as it were a fight at sea.*

*Enter Lieutenant, a Shipmaster and his Mate, Walter Whitmore, and others; with them Suffolk, disguised, and other Gentlemen, prisoners.*

**LIEU.**
==1== The gaudy, blabbing, and remorseful day
==2== Is crept into the bosom of the sea;
==3== And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
==4== That drag the tragic melancholy night;
==5== Who with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wings
==6== Cleep dead men’s graves, and from their misty jaws
==7== Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
==8== Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize,
==9== For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,
==10== Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,
==11== Or with their blood stain this discolored shore.
==12== Master, this prisoner freely give I thee,
==13== And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;
==14== The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.

**1. GENT.**
==15== What is my ransom, master? Let me know.

**MAST.**
==16== A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.

**MATE.**
==17== And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.

**LIEU.**
==18== What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,
==19== And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
==20== Cut both the villains’ throats; for die you shall.
==21== The lives of those which we have lost in fight
==22== Be counterpois’d with such a petty sum!

**1. GENT.**
==23== I’ll give it, sir, and therefore spare my life.

**2. GENT.**
==24== And so will I, and write home for it straight.

**WHIT.**
==25== I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
==26== And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die,
*(To Suffolk.)*
==27== And so should these, if I might have my will.

**LIEU.**
==28== Be not so rash, take ransom, let him live.

**SUF.**
==29== Look on my George, I am a gentleman:
==30== Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.

**WHIT.**
==31== And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.
==32== How now? Why starts thou? What, doth death affright?

**SUF.**
==33== Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
==34== A cunning man did calculate my birth
==35== And told me that by water I should die:
==36== Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
==37== Thy name is Gualtier, being rightly sounded.

**WHIT.**
==38== Gualtier or Walter, which it is, I care not.
==39== Never yet did base dishonor blur our name
==40== But with our sword we wip’d away the blot;
==41== Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
==42== Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defac’d,
==43== And I proclaim’d a coward through the world!

**SUF.**
==44== Stay, Whitmore, for thy prisoner is a prince,
==45== The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.

**WHIT.**
==46== The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags?

**SUF.**
==47== Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke;
==48== Jove sometime went disguis’d, and why not I?

**LIEU.**
==49== But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.

**SUF.**
==50== Obscure and lousy swain, King Henry’s blood,
==51== The honorable blood of Lancaster,
==52== Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
==53== Hast thou not kiss’d thy hand and held my stirrup?
==54== Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
==55== And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
==56== How often hast thou waited at my cup,
==57== Fed from my trencher, kneel’d down at the board,
==58== When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
==59== Remember it, and let it make thee crestfall’n,
==60== Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride:
==61== How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
==62== And duly waited for my coming forth?
==63== This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,
==64== And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.

**WHIT.**
==65== Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?

**LIEU.**
==66== First let my words stab him, as he hath me.

**SUF.**
==67== Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.

**LIEU.**
==68== Convey him hence, and on our longboat’s side
==69== Strike off his head.

**SUF.**
==69==            Thou dar’st not, for thy own.

**LIEU.**
==70== Yes, Poole.

**SUF.**
==70==         Poole?

**LIEU.**
==70==               Poole! Sir Poole! Lord!
==71== Ay, kennel, puddle, sink, whose filth and dirt
==72== Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
==73== Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
==74== For swallowing the treasure of the realm.
==75== Thy lips that kiss’d the Queen shall sweep the ground,
==76== And thou that smil’dst at good Duke Humphrey’s death
==77== Against the senseless winds shall grin in vain,
==78== Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again;
==79== And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,
==80== For daring to affy a mighty lord
==81== Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
==82== Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
==83== By devilish policy art thou grown great,
==84== And like ambitious Sylla, overgorg’d
==85== With gobbets of thy mother’s bleeding heart.
==86== By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France.
==87== The false revolting Normans thorough thee
==88== Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy
==89== Hath slain their governors, surpris’d our forts,
==90== And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
==91== The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,
==92== Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,
==93== As hating thee, are rising up in arms;
==94== And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
==95== By shameful murder of a guiltless king
==96== And lofty, proud, encroaching tyranny,
==97== Burns with revenging fire, whose hopeful colors
==98== Advance our half-fac’d sun, striving to shine,
==99== Under the which is writ, “*Invitis nubibus*.”
==100== The commons here in Kent are up in arms,
==101== And to conclude, reproach and beggary
==102== Is crept into the palace of our king,
==103== And all by thee. Away, convey him hence.

**SUF.**
==104== O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
==105== Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!
==106== Small things make base men proud. This villain here,
==107== Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
==108== Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
==109== Drones suck not eagles’ blood, but rob beehives.
==110== It is impossible that I should die
==111== By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
==112== Thy words move rage and not remorse in me.

**LIEU.**
==113== Ay, but my deeds shall stay thy fury soon.

**SUF.**
==114== I go of message from the Queen to France;
==115== I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.

**WHIT.**
==116== Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.

**SUF.**
==117== *Pene gelidus timor occupat artus*: it is thee I fear.

**WHIT.**
==118== Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
==119== What, are ye daunted now? Now will ye stoop?

**1. GENT.**
==120== My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.

**SUF.**
==121== Suffolk’s imperial tongue is stern and rough,
==122== Us’d to command, untaught to plead for favor.
==123== Far be it we should honor such as these
==124== With humble suit. No, rather let my head
==125== Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
==126== Save to the God of heaven and to my king;
==127== And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
==128== Than stand uncover’d to the vulgar groom.
==129== True nobility is exempt from fear:
==130== More can I bear than you dare execute.

**LIEU.**
==131== Hale him away, and let him talk no more.

**SUF.**
==132== Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
==133== That this my death may never be forgot!
==134== Great men oft die by vild besonians:
==135== A Roman sworder and bandetto slave
==136== Murder’d sweet Tully; Brutus’ bastard hand
==137== Stabb’d Julius Caesar; savage islanders
==138== Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.

*Exit Walter Whitmore with Suffolk.*

**LIEU.**
==139== And as for these whose ransom we have set,
==140== It is our pleasure one of them depart;
==141== Therefore come you with us and let him go.

*Exeunt Lieutenant and the rest. Manet the First Gentleman.*

*Enter Walter Whitmore with the body of Suffolk.*

**WHIT.**
==142== There let his head and lifeless body lie,
==143== Until the Queen his mistress bury it.

*Exit Walter.*

**1. GENT.**
==144== O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
==145== His body will I bear unto the King.
==146== If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;
==147== So will the Queen, that living held him dear.

*Exit with the body.*
