## Act 4, Scene 10
[[Act 4, Scene 9|← Act 4, Scene 9]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Kent. Iden’s Garden.*

*Enter Cade.*

**CADE.**
==1== Fie on ambitions! Fie on myself, that have a sword, and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for all the country is laid for me; but now am I so hungry that, if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years, I could stay no longer. Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climb’d into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man’s stomach this hot weather. And I think this word ’sallet’ was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and bravely marching, it hath serv’d me instead of a quart pot to drink in; and now the word ‘sallet’ must serve me to feed on.

*He lies down picking of herbs and eating them.*

*Enter Iden followed at a distance by his Servants.*

**IDEN.**
==2== Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court
==3== And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?
==4== This small inheritance my father left me
==5== Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.
==6== I seek not to wax great by others’ waning,
==7== Or gather wealth, I care not with what envy.
==8== Sufficeth that I have maintains my state
==9== And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.

**CADE.**
*(Aside.)*
==10== Here’s the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.—Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand crowns of the King by carrying my head to him, but I’ll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.

**IDEN.**
==11== Why, rude companion, whatsoe’er thou be,
==12== I know thee not, why then should I betray thee?
==13== Is’t not enough to break into my garden,
==14== And like a thief to come to rob my grounds,
==15== Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,
==16== But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?

**CADE.**
==17== Brave thee? Ay, by the best blood that ever was broach’d, and beard thee too. Look on me well. I have eat no meat these five days, yet come thou and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.

**IDEN.**
==18== Nay, it shall ne’er be said, while England stands,
==19== That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,
==20== Took odds to combat a poor famish’d man.
==21== Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,
==22== See if thou canst outface me with thy looks.
==23== Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;
==24== Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
==25== Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;
==26== My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast,
==27== And if mine arm be heaved in the air,
==28== Thy grave is digg’d already in the earth.
==29== As for words, whose greatness answers words,
==30== Let this my sword report what speech forbears.

**CADE.**
==31== By my valor, the most complete champion that ever I heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out the burly-bon’d clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou mayst be turn’d to hobnails.
*(Here they fight and Cade falls down.)*
==32== O, I am slain! Famine and no other hath slain me. Let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me but the ten meals I have lost, and I’d defy them all. Wither, garden, and be henceforth a burying-place to all that do dwell in this house, because the unconquer’d soul of Cade is fled.

**IDEN.**
==33== Is’t Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
==34== Sword, I will hallow thee for this thy deed,
==35== And hang thee o’er my tomb when I am dead.
==36== Ne’er shall this blood be wiped from thy point,
==37== But thou shalt wear it as a herald’s coat,
==38== To emblaze the honor that thy master got.

**CADE.**
==39== Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort all the world to be cowards; for I, that never fear’d any, am vanquish’d by famine, not by valor.

*Dies.*

**IDEN.**
==40== How much thou wrong’st me, heaven be my judge.
==41== Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;
==42== And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
==43== So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.
==44== Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
==45== Unto a dunghill, which shall be thy grave,
==46== And there cut off thy most ungracious head,
==47== Which I will bear in triumph to the King,
==48== Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.

*Exit dragging out the body, with his Servants.*
