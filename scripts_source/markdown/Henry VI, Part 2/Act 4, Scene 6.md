## Act 4, Scene 6
[[Act 4, Scene 5|← Act 4, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 7|Act 4, Scene 7 →]]

*London. Cannon Street.*

*Enter Jack Cade and the rest, and strikes his staff on London Stone.*

**CADE.**
Now is Mortimer lord of this city. And here, sitting upon London Stone, I charge and command that, of the city’s cost, the pissing-conduit run nothing but claret wine this first year of our reign. And now henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls me other than Lord Mortimer.

*Enter a Rebel Soldier running.*

**REBEL SOLD.**
Jack Cade! Jack Cade!

**CADE.**
Knock him down there.

*They kill him.*

**SMITH.**
If this fellow be wise, he’ll never call ye Jack Cade more. I think he hath a very fair warning.

**DICK.**
My lord, there’s an army gather’d together in Smithfield.

**CADE.**
Come, then, let’s go fight with them. But first go and set London Bridge on fire, and if you can, burn down the Tower too. Come, let’s away.

*Exeunt omnes.*
