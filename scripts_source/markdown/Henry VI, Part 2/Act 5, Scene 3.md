## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]]

*Field nearby Saint Albans.*

*Alarum. Retreat. Enter York, Richard, Warwick, and Soldiers with Drum and Colors.*

**YORK.**
==1== Of Salisbury, who can report of him,
==2== That winter lion, who in rage forgets
==3== Aged contusions and all brush of time;
==4== And like a gallant in the brow of youth,
==5== Repairs him with occasion? This happy day
==6== Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,
==7== If Salisbury be lost.

**RICH.**
==7==            My noble father,
==8== Three times today I help him to his horse,
==9== Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,
==10== Persuaded him from any further act:
==11== But still, where danger was, still there I met him,
==12== And like rich hangings in a homely house,
==13== So was his will in his old feeble body.
==14== But noble as he is, look where he comes.

*Enter Salisbury.*

**SAL.**
==15== Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought today;
==16== By th’ mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard.
==17== God knows how long it is I have to live,
==18== And it hath pleas’d him that three times today
==19== You have defended me from imminent death.
==20== Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:
==21== ’Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
==22== Being opposites of such repairing nature.

**YORK.**
==23== I know our safety is to follow them,
==24== For, as I hear, the King is fled to London,
==25== To call a present court of parliament.
==26== Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.
==27== What says Lord Warwick? Shall we after them?

**WAR.**
==28== After them! Nay, before them, if we can.
==29== Now, by my faith, lords, ’twas a glorious day.
==30== Saint Albans battle won by famous York
==31== Shall be eterniz’d in all age to come.
==32== Sound drum and trumpets, and to London all,
==33== And more such days as these to us befall!

*Exeunt.*
