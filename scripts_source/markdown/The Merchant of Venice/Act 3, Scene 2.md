## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.*

*Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, Nerissa, and all their Trains.*

**POR.**
==1==I pray you tarry, pause a day or two
==2==Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong
==3==I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.
==4==There’s something tells me (but it is not love) 
==5==I would not lose you, and you know yourself,
==6==Hate counsels not in such a quality.
==7==But lest you should not understand me well⁠—
==8==And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought⁠—
==9==I would detain you here some month or two
==10==Before you venture for me. I could teach you
==11==How to choose right, but then I am forsworn.
==12==So will I never be, so may you miss me,
==13==But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,
==14==That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
==15==They have o’erlook’d me and divided me:
==16==One half of me is yours, the other half yours⁠—
==17==Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
==18==And so all yours. O, these naughty times
==19==Puts bars between the owners and their rights!
==20==And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
==21==Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
==22==I speak too long, but ’tis to peize the time,
==23==To eche it, and to draw it out in length,
==24==To stay you from election.

**BASS.**
==24==              Let me choose,
==25==For as I am, I live upon the rack.

**POR.**
==26==Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess
==27==What treason there is mingled with your love.

**BASS.**
==28==None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
==29==Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love;
==30==There may as well be amity and life
==31==’Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.

**POR.**
==32==Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
==33==Where men enforced do speak any thing.

**BASS.**
==34==Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.

**POR.**
==35==Well then, confess and live.

**BASS.**
==35==              Confess and love
==36==Had been the very sum of my confession.
==37==O happy torment, when my torturer
==38==Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
==39==But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

**POR.**
==40==Away then! I am lock’d in one of them;
==41==If you do love me, you will find me out.
==42==Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
==43==Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
==44==Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end,
==45==Fading in music. That the comparison
==46==May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
==47==And wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win,
==48==And what is music then? Then music is
==49==Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
==50==To a new-crowned monarch; such it is
==51==As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
==52==That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear,
==53==And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
==54==With no less presence, but with much more love,
==55==Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
==56==The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
==57==To the sea-monster. I stand for sacrifice;
==58==The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
==59==With bleared visages, come forth to view
==60==The issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules,
==61==Live thou, I live; with much, much more dismay
==62==I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.

*Here music.*

*A song, the whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself.*

**SING.**
==63== *Tell me where is fancy bred,*
==64== *Or in the heart or in the head?*
==65== *How begot, how nourished?*

**ALL.**
==66== *Reply, reply.*

**SING.**
==67== *It is engend’red in the eyes,*
==68== *With gazing fed, and fancy dies*
==69== *In the cradle where it lies.*
==70== *Let us all ring fancy’s knell.*
==71== *I’ll begin it.Ding, dong, bell.*

**ALL.**
==72== *Ding, dong, bell.*

**BASS.**
==73==So may the outward shows be least themselves⁠—
==74==The world is still deceiv’d with ornament.
==75==In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt
==76==But, being season’d with a gracious voice,
==77==Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
==78==What damned error but some sober brow
==79==Will bless it, and approve it with a text,
==80==Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
==81==There is no vice so simple but assumes
==82==Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.
==83==How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
==84==As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
==85==The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,
==86==Who inward search’d, have livers white as milk,
==87==And these assume but valor’s excrement
==88==To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
==89==And you shall see ’tis purchas’d by the weight,
==90==Which therein works a miracle in nature,
==91==Making them lightest that wear most of it.
==92==So are those crisped snaky golden locks,
==93==Which make such wanton gambols with the wind
==94==Upon supposed fairness, often known
==95==To be the dowry of a second head,
==96==The skull that bred them in the sepulcher.
==97==Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
==98==To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
==99==Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
==100==The seeming truth which cunning times put on
==101==To entrap the wisest. Therefore then, thou gaudy gold,
==102==Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
==103==Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
==104==’Tween man and man; but thou, thou meager lead,
==105==Which rather threaten’st than dost promise aught,
==106==Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,
==107==And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!

**POR.**
*(Aside.)*
==108==How all the other passions fleet to air,
==109==As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac’d despair,
==110==And shudd’ring fear, and green-eyed jealousy!
==111==O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,
==112==In measure rain thy joy, scant this excess!
==113==I feel too much thy blessing; make it less,
==114==For fear I surfeit.

**BASS.**
==114==           What find I here?
*(Opening the leaden casket.)*
==115==Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demigod
==116==Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
==117==Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
==118==Seem they in motion? Here are sever’d lips,
==119==Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar
==120==Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
==121==The painter plays the spider, and hath woven
==122==A golden mesh t’ entrap the hearts of men
==123==Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes⁠—
==124==How could he see to do them? Having made one,
==125==Methinks it should have power to steal both his
==126==And leave itself unfurnish’d. Yet look how far
==127==The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
==128==In underprizing it, so far this shadow
==129==Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,
==130==The continent and summary of my fortune.
*(Reads.)*
==131==*“You that choose not by the view,*
==132==*Chance as fair, and choose as true:*
==133==*Since this fortune falls to you,*
==134==*Be content, and seek no new.*
==135==*If you be well pleas’d with this,*
==136==*And hold your fortune for your bliss,*
==137==*Turn you where your lady is,*
==138==*And claim her with a loving kiss.”*
==139==A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave,
==140==I come by note, to give and to receive.
==141==Like one of two contending in a prize,
==142==That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,
==143==Hearing applause and universal shout,
==144==Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
==145==Whether those peals of praise be his or no,
==146==So, thrice-fair lady, stand I, even so,
==147==As doubtful whether what I see be true,
==148==Until confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you.

**POR.**
==149==You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
==150==Such as I am. Though for myself alone
==151==I would not be ambitious in my wish
==152==To wish myself much better, yet for you,
==153==I would be trebled twenty times myself,
==154==A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,
==155==That only to stand high in your account,
==156==I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,
==157==Exceed account. But the full sum of me
==158==Is sum of something; which, to term in gross,
==159==Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractic’d,
==160==Happy in this, she is not yet so old
==161==But she may learn; happier than this,
==162==She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
==163==Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit
==164==Commits itself to yours to be directed,
==165==As from her lord, her governor, her king.
==166==Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours
==167==Is now converted. But now I was the lord
==168==Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
==169==Queen o’er myself; and even now, but now,
==170==This house, these servants, and this same myself
==171==Are yours—my lord’s!—I give them with this ring,
==172==Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
==173==Let it presage the ruin of your love,
==174==And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

**BASS.**
==175==Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
==176==Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,
==177==And there is such confusion in my powers,
==178==As after some oration fairly spoke
==179==By a beloved prince, there doth appear
==180==Among the buzzing pleased multitude,
==181==Where every something, being blent together,
==182==Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy
==183==Express’d and not express’d. But when this ring
==184==Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence;
==185==O then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!

**NER.**
==186==My lord and lady, it is now our time,
==187==That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
==188==To cry good joy. Good joy, my lord and lady!

**GRA.**
==189==My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
==190==I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
==191==For I am sure you can wish none from me;
==192==And when your honors mean to solemnize
==193==The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you
==194==Even at that time I may be married too.

**BASS.**
==195==With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

**GRA.**
==196==I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
==197==My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
==198==You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
==199==You lov’d, I lov’d; for intermission
==200==No more pertains to me, my lord, than you;
==201==Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,
==202==And so did mine too as the matter falls;
==203==For wooing here until I sweat again,
==204==And swearing till my very roof was dry
==205==With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
==206==I got a promise of this fair one here
==207==To have her love—provided that your fortune
==208==Achiev’d her mistress.

**POR.**
==208==           Is this true, Nerissa?

**NER.**
==209==Madam, it is, so you stand pleas’d withal.

**BASS.**
==210==And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

**GRA.**
==211==Yes, faith, my lord.

**BASS.**
==212==Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage.

**GRA.**
==213==We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.

**NER.**
==214==What, and stake down?

**GRA.**
==215==No, we shall ne’er win at that sport, and stake down.
==216==But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?
==217==What, and my old Venetian friend Salerio?

*Enter Lorenzo, Jessica, and Salerio, a messenger from Venice.*

**BASS.**
==218==Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,
==219==If that the youth of my new int’rest here
==220==Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
==221==I bid my very friends and countrymen,
==222==Sweet Portia, welcome.

**POR.**
==222==              So do I, my lord,
==223==They are entirely welcome.

**LOR.**
==224==I thank your honor. For my part, my lord,
==225==My purpose was not to have seen you here,
==226==But meeting with Salerio by the way,
==227==He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
==228==To come with him along.

**SAL.**
==228==              I did, my lord,
==229==And I have reason for it. *Signior* Antonio
==230==Commends him to you.

*Gives Bassanio a letter.*

**BASS.**
==230==              Ere I ope his letter,
==231==I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.

**SAL.**
==232==Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind,
==233==Nor well, unless in mind. His letter there
==234==Will show you his estate.

*Bassanio opens the letter.*

**GRA.**
==235==Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.
==236==Your hand, Salerio. What’s the news from Venice?
==237==How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
==238==I know he will be glad of our success;
==239==We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.

**SAL.**
==240==I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.

**POR.**
==241==There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper
==242==That steals the color from Bassanio’s cheek⁠—
==243==Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world
==244==Could turn so much the constitution
==245==Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
==246==With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,
==247==And I must freely have the half of any thing
==248==That this same paper brings you.

**BASS.**
==248==                  O sweet Portia,
==249==Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words
==250==That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
==251==When I did first impart my love to you,
==252==I freely told you all the wealth I had
==253==Ran in my veins: I was a gentleman;
==254==And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,
==255==Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
==256==How much I was a braggart: when I told you
==257==My state was nothing, I should then have told you
==258==That I was worse than nothing; for indeed
==259==I have engag’d myself to a dear friend,
==260==Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy,
==261==To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,
==262==The paper as the body of my friend,
==263==And every word in it a gaping wound
==264==Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
==265==Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?
==266==From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,
==267==From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,
==268==And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch
==269==Of merchant-marring rocks?

**SAL.**
==269==                Not one, my lord.
==270==Besides, it should appear, that if he had
==271==The present money to discharge the Jew,
==272==He would not take it. Never did I know
==273==A creature that did bear the shape of man
==274==So keen and greedy to confound a man.
==275==He plies the Duke at morning and at night,
==276==And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
==277==If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,
==278==The Duke himself, and the magnificoes
==279==Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him,
==280==But none can drive him from the envious plea
==281==Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.

**JES.**
==282==When I was with him I have heard him swear
==283==To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
==284==That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh
==285==Than twenty times the value of the sum
==286==That he did owe him; and I know, my lord,
==287==If law, authority, and power deny not,
==288==It will go hard with poor Antonio.

**POR.**
==289==Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

**BASS.**
==290==The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
==291==The best-condition’d and unwearied spirit
==292==In doing courtesies, and one in whom
==293==The ancient Roman honor more appears
==294==Than any that draws breath in Italy.

**POR.**
==295==What sum owes he the Jew?

**BASS.**
==296==For me, three thousand ducats.

**POR.**
==296==                  What, no more?
==297==Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
==298==Double six thousand, and then treble that,
==299==Before a friend of this description
==300==Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.
==301==First go with me to church and call me wife,
==302==And then away to Venice to your friend;
==303==For never shall you lie by Portia’s side
==304==With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
==305==To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
==306==When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
==307==My maid Nerissa and myself mean time
==308==Will live as maids and widows. Come away!
==309==For you shall hence upon your wedding-day.
==310==Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer⁠—
==311==Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
==312==But let me hear the letter of your friend.

**BASS.**
*(Reads.)*
==313==*“Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all debts are clear’d between you and I, if I might but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure; if your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.”*

**POR.**
==314==O love! Dispatch all business and be gone.

**BASS.**
==315==Since I have your good leave to go away,
==316==I will make haste; but till I come again,
==317==No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,
==318==Nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.

*Exeunt.*
