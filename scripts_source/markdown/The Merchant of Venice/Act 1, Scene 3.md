## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Venice. A public place.*

*Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.*

**SHY.**
==1==Three thousand ducats, well.

**BASS.**
==2==Ay, sir, for three months.

**SHY.**
==3==For three months, well.

**BASS.**
==4==For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

**SHY.**
==5==Antonio shall become bound, well.

**BASS.**
==6==May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know your answer?

**SHY.**
==7==Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.

**BASS.**
==8==Your answer to that.

**SHY.**
==9==Antonio is a good man.

**BASS.**
==10==Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?

**SHY.**
==11==Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand moreover upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath, squand’red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is notwithstanding sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may take his bond.

**BASS.**
==12==Be assur’d you may.

**SHY.**
==13==I will be assur’d I may; and that I may be assur’d, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?

**BASS.**
==14==If it please you to dine with us.

**SHY.**
==15==Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjur’d the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?

*Enter Antonio.*

**BASS.**
==16==This is *Signior* Antonio.

**SHY.**
*(Aside.)*
==17==How like a fawning publican he looks!
==18==I hate him for he is a Christian;
==19==But more, for that in low simplicity
==20==He lends out money gratis, and brings down
==21==The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
==22==If I can catch him once upon the hip,
==23==I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
==24==He hates our sacred nation, and he rails
==25==Even there where merchants most do congregate
==26==On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,
==27==Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe
==28==If I forgive him!

**BASS.**
==28==           Shylock, do you hear?

**SHY.**
==29==I am debating of my present store,
==30==And by the near guess of my memory,
==31==I cannot instantly raise up the gross
==32==Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
==33==Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
==34==Will furnish me. But soft, how many months
==35==Do you desire?
*(To Antonio.)*
==36==Rest you fair, good *signior*,
==37==Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

**ANT.**
==38==Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow
==39==By taking nor by giving of excess,
==40==Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
==41==I’ll break a custom.
*(To Bassanio.)*
==41==           Is he yet possess’d
==42==How much ye would?

**SHY.**
==42==           Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

**ANT.**
==43==And for three months.

**SHY.**
==44==I had forgot—three months⁠—
*(To Bassanio.)*
==44==                  you told me so.
==45==Well then, your bond; and let me see—but hear you,
==46==Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow
==47==Upon advantage.

**ANT.**
==47==           I do never use it.

**SHY.**
==48==When Jacob graz’d his uncle Laban’s sheep⁠—
==49==This Jacob from our holy Abram was
==50==(As his wise mother wrought in his behalf) 
==51==The third possessor; ay, he was the third⁠—

**ANT.**
==52==And what of him? Did he take interest?

**SHY.**
==53==No, not take interest, not as you would say
==54==Directly int’rest. Mark what Jacob did:
==55==When Laban and himself were compromis’d
==56==That all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied
==57==Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes being rank
==58==In end of autumn turned to the rams,
==59==And when the work of generation was
==60==Between these woolly breeders in the act,
==61==The skillful shepherd pill’d me certain wands,
==62==And in the doing of the deed of kind,
==63==He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
==64==Who then conceiving did in eaning time
==65==Fall parti-color’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s.
==66==This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;
==67==And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

**ANT.**
==68==This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv’d for,
==69==A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
==70==But sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven.
==71==Was this inserted to make interest good?
==72==Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

**SHY.**
==73==I cannot tell, I make it breed as fast.
==74==But note me, *signior*.

**ANT.**
==74==           Mark you this, Bassanio,
==75==The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
==76==An evil soul producing holy witness
==77==Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
==78==A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
==79==O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

**SHY.**
==80==Three thousand ducats—’tis a good round sum.
==81==Three months from twelve; then let me see, the rate⁠—

**ANT.**
==82==Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

**SHY.**
==83==*Signior* Antonio, many a time and oft
==84==In the Rialto you have rated me
==85==About my moneys and my usances.
==86==Still have I borne it with a patient shrug
==87==(For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe).
==88==You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
==89==And spet upon my Jewish gaberdine,
==90==And all for use of that which is mine own.
==91==Well then, it now appears you need my help.
==92==Go to then, you come to me, and you say,
==93==“Shylock, we would have moneys,” you say so⁠—
==94==You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,
==95==And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
==96==Over your threshold; moneys is your suit.
==97==What should I say to you? Should I not say,
==98==“Hath a dog money? Is it possible
==99==A cur can lend three thousand ducats?” Or
==100==Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key,
==101==With bated breath and whisp’ring humbleness,
==102==Say this:
==103==“Fair sir, you spet on me on Wednesday last,
==104==You spurn’d me such a day, another time
==105==You call’d me dog; and for these courtesies
==106==I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?

**ANT.**
==107==I am as like to call thee so again,
==108==To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.
==109==If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
==110==As to thy friends, for when did friendship take
==111==A breed for barren metal of his friend?
==112==But lend it rather to thine enemy,
==113==Who if he break, thou mayst with better face
==114==Exact the penalty.

**SHY.**
==114==           Why, look you how you storm!
==115==I would be friends with you, and have your love,
==116==Forget the shames that you have stain’d me with,
==117==Supply your present wants, and take no doit
==118==Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me.
==119==This is kind I offer.

**BASS.**
==120==This were kindness.

**SHY.**
==120==           This kindness will I show.
==121==Go with me to a notary, seal me there
==122==Your single bond; and in a merry sport
==123==If you repay me not on such a day,
==124==In such a place, such sum or sums as are
==125==Express’d in the condition, let the forfeit
==126==Be nominated for an equal pound
==127==Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
==128==In what part of your body pleaseth me.

**ANT.**
==129==Content, in faith, I’ll seal to such a bond,
==130==And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

**BASS.**
==131==You shall not seal to such a bond for me,
==132==I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.

**ANT.**
==133==Why, fear not, man, I will not forfeit it.
==134==Within these two months, that’s a month before
==135==This bond expires, I do expect return
==136==Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

**SHY.**
==137==O father Abram, what these Christians are,
==138==Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
==139==The thoughts of others! Pray you tell me this:
==140==If he should break his day, what should I gain
==141==By the exaction of the forfeiture?
==142==A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man
==143==Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
==144==As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
==145==To buy his favor, I extend this friendship.
==146==If he will take it, so, if not, *adieu*;
==147==And for my love I pray you wrong me not.

**ANT.**
==148==Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

**SHY.**
==149==Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s;
==150==Give him direction for this merry bond,
==151==And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
==152==See to my house, left in the fearful guard
==153==Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
==154==I’ll be with you.

*Exit.*

**ANT.**
==154==           Hie thee, gentle Jew.
==155==The Hebrew will turn Christian, he grows kind.

**BASS.**
==156==I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.

**ANT.**
==157==Come on, in this there can be no dismay,
==158==My ships come home a month before the day.

*Exeunt.*
