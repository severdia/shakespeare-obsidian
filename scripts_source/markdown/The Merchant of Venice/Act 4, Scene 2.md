## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Venice. A street.*

*Enter Portia and Nerissa disguised as before.*

**POR.**
Inquire the Jew’s house out, give him this deed,
And let him sign it. We’ll away tonight,
And be a day before our husbands home.
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.

*Enter Gratiano.*

**GRA.**
Fair sir, you are well o’erta’en.
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
Your company at dinner.

**POR.**
              That cannot be.
His ring I do accept most thankfully,
And so I pray you tell him; furthermore,
I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house.

**GRA.**
That will I do.

**NER.**
        Sir, I would speak with you.
*(Aside to Portia.)*
I’ll see if I can get my husband’s ring,
Which I did make him swear to keep forever.

**POR.**
*(Aside to Nerissa)*
Thou mayst, I warrant. We shall have old swearing
That they did give the rings away to men;
But we’ll outface them, and outswear them too.⁠—
Away, make haste. Thou know’st where I will tarry.

**NER.**
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?

*Exeunt.*
