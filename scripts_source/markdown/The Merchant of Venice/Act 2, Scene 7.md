## Act 2, Scene 7
[[Act 2, Scene 6|← Act 2, Scene 6]] | [[Act 2, Scene 8|Act 2, Scene 8 →]]

*Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.*

*Flourish cornets. Enter Portia with the Prince of Morocco and both their Trains.*

**POR.**
==1== Go, draw aside the curtains and discover
==2== The several caskets to this noble prince.
==3== Now make your choice.

**MOR.**
==4== This first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
==5== “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire”;
==6== The second, silver, which this promise carries,
==7== “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves”;
==8== This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
==9== “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
==10== How shall I know if I do choose the right?

**POR.**
==11== The one of them contains my picture, Prince:
==12== If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

**MOR.**
==13== Some god direct my judgment! Let me see,
==14== I will survey th’ inscriptions back again.
==15== What says this leaden casket?
==16== “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”
==17== Must give—for what? For lead, hazard for lead?
==18== This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
==19== Do it in hope of fair advantages;
==20== A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.
==21== I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
==22== What says the silver with her virgin hue?
==23== “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”
==24== As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
==25== And weigh thy value with an even hand.
==26== If thou beest rated by thy estimation,
==27== Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough
==28== May not extend so far as to the lady;
==29== And yet to be afeard of my deserving
==30== Were but a weak disabling of myself.
==31== As much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady.
==32== I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
==33== In graces, and in qualities of breeding;
==34== But more than these, in love I do deserve.
==35== What if I stray’d no farther, but chose here?
==36== Let’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold:
==37== “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”
==38== Why, that’s the lady, all the world desires her.
==39== From the four corners of the earth they come
==40== To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.
==41== The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
==42== Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now
==43== For princes to come view fair Portia.
==44== The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
==45== Spets in the face of heaven, is no bar
==46== To stop the foreign spirits, but they come
==47== As o’er a brook to see fair Portia.
==48== One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
==49== Is’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation
==50== To think so base a thought; it were too gross
==51== To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
==52== Or shall I think in silver she’s immur’d,
==53== Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
==54== O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
==55== Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
==56== A coin that bears the figure of an angel
==57== Stamp’d in gold, but that’s insculp’d upon;
==58== But here an angel in a golden bed
==59== Lies all within. Deliver me the key.
==60== Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

**POR.**
==61== There take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,
==62== Then I am yours.

*He unlocks the golden casket.*

**MOR.**
==62==            O hell! What have we here?
==63== A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
==64== There is a written scroll! I’ll read the writing.
*(Reads.)*
==65== *“All that glisters is not gold,*
==66== *Often have you heard that told;*
==67== *Many a man his life hath sold*
==68== *But my outside to behold.*
==69== *Gilded tombs do worms infold.*
==70== *Had you been as wise as bold,*
==71== *Young in limbs, in judgment old,*
==72== *Your answer had not been inscroll’d.*
==73== *Fare you well, your suit is cold.”*
==74== *Cold indeed, and labor lost:*
==75== *Then farewell heat, and welcome frost!*
==76== Portia, *adieu*. I have too griev’d a heart
==77== To take a tedious leave; thus losers part.

*Exit with his Train.*

**POR.**
==78== A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
==79== Let all of his complexion choose me so.

*Exeunt.*
