## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Venice. A street.*

*Enter Shylock the Jew and Solanio and Antonio and the Jailer.*

**SHY.**
==1==Jailer, look to him, tell not me of mercy.
==2==This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
==3==Jailer, look to him.

**ANT.**
==3==           Hear me yet, good Shylock.

**SHY.**
==4==I’ll have my bond, speak not against my bond,
==5==I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
==6==Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,
==7==But since I am a dog, beware my fangs.
==8==The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
==9==Thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond
==10==To come abroad with him at his request.

**ANT.**
==11==I pray thee hear me speak.

**SHY.**
==12==I’ll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak.
==13==I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.
==14==I’ll not be made a soft and dull-ey’d fool
==15==To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
==16==To Christian intercessors. Follow not,
==17==I’ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.

*Exit Jew.*

**SOL.**
==18==It is the most impenetrable cur
==19==That ever kept with men.

**ANT.**
==19==              Let him alone,
==20==I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
==21==He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
==22==I oft deliver’d from his forfeitures
==23==Many that have at times made moan to me;
==24==Therefore he hates me.

**SOL.**
==24==              I am sure the Duke
==25==Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

**ANT.**
==26==The Duke cannot deny the course of law;
==27==For the commodity that strangers have
==28==With us in Venice, if it be denied,
==29==Will much impeach the justice of the state,
==30==Since that the trade and profit of the city
==31==Consisteth of all nations. Therefore go.
==32==These griefs and losses have so bated me
==33==That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
==34==Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.
==35==Well, jailer, on. Pray God Bassanio come
==36==To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!

*Exeunt.*
