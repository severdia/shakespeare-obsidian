## Act 2, Scene 6
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 7|Act 2, Scene 7 →]]

*Venice. Before Shylock’s house.*

*Enter two of the masquers, Gratiano and Salerio.*

**GRA.**
==1==This is the penthouse under which Lorenzo
==2==Desir’d us to make stand.

**SAL.**
==2==              His hour is almost past.

**GRA.**
==3==And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
==4==For lovers ever run before the clock.

**SAL.**
==5==O, ten times faster Venus’ pigeons fly
==6==To seal love’s bonds new made, than they are wont
==7==To keep obliged faith unforfeited!

**GRA.**
==8==That ever holds. Who riseth from a feast
==9==With that keen appetite that he sits down?
==10==Where is the horse that doth untread again
==11==His tedious measures with the unbated fire
==12==That he did pace them first? All things that are,
==13==Are with more spirit chased than enjoy’d.
==14==How like a younger or a prodigal
==15==The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
==16==Hugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind!
==17==How like the prodigal doth she return,
==18==With over-weather’d ribs and ragged sails,
==19==Lean, rent, and beggar’d by the strumpet wind!

*Enter Lorenzo.*

**SAL.**
==20==Here comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter.

**LOR.**
==21==Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
==22==Not I but my affairs have made you wait.
==23==When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
==24==I’ll watch as long for you then. Approach,
==25==Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! Who’s within?

*Enter Jessica above in boy’s clothes.*

**JES.**
==26==Who are you? Tell me for more certainty,
==27==Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.

**LOR.**
==28==Lorenzo, and thy love.

**JES.**
==29==Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
==30==For who love I so much? And now who knows
==31==But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

**LOR.**
==32==Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

**JES.**
==33==Here, catch this casket, it is worth the pains.
==34==I am glad ’tis night, you do not look on me,
==35==For I am much asham’d of my exchange.
==36==But love is blind, and lovers cannot see
==37==The pretty follies that themselves commit,
==38==For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
==39==To see me thus transformed to a boy.

**LOR.**
==40==Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.

**JES.**
==41==What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
==42==They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.
==43==Why, ’tis an office of discovery, love,
==44==And I should be obscur’d.

**LOR.**
==44==              So are you, sweet,
==45==Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
==46==But come at once,
==47==For the close night doth play the runaway,
==48==And we are stay’d for at Bassanio’s feast.

**JES.**
==49==I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
==50==With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

*Exit above.*

**GRA.**
==51==Now by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.

**LOR.**
==52==Beshrew me but I love her heartily,
==53==For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
==54==And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
==55==And true she is, as she hath prov’d herself;
==56==And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,
==57==Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
*(Enter Jessica.)*
==58==What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away!
==59==Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

*Exit with Jessica and Salerio.*

*Enter Antonio.*

**ANT.**
==60==Who’s there?

**GRA.**
==61==*Signior* Antonio!

**ANT.**
==62==Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?
==63==’Tis nine o’clock—our friends all stay for you.
==64==No masque tonight, the wind is come about,
==65==Bassanio presently will go aboard.
==66==I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

**GRA.**
==67==I am glad on’t. I desire no more delight
==68==Than to be under sail, and gone tonight.

*Exeunt.*
