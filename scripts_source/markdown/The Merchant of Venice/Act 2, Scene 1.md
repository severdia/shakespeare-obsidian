## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.*

*Flourish cornets. Enter the Prince of Morocco, a tawny Moor, all in white, and three or four Followers accordingly, with Portia, Nerissa, and their Train.*

**MOR.**
==1== Mislike me not for my complexion,
==2== The shadowed livery of the burnish’d sun,
==3== To whom I am a neighbor and near bred.
==4== Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
==5== Where Phoebus’ fire scarce thaws the icicles,
==6== And let us make incision for your love,
==7== To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
==8== I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
==9== Hath fear’d the valiant; by my love, I swear
==10== The best-regarded virgins of our clime
==11== Have lov’d it too. I would not change this hue,
==12== Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

**POR.**
==13== In terms of choice I am not solely led
==14== By nice direction of a maiden’s eyes;
==15== Besides, the lott’ry of my destiny
==16== Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.
==17== But if my father had not scanted me,
==18== And hedg’d me by his wit to yield myself
==19== His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
==20== Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair
==21== As any comer I have look’d on yet
==22== For my affection.

**MOR.**
==22==            Even for that I thank you;
==23== Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets
==24== To try my fortune. By this scimitar
==25== That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
==26== That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
==27== I would o’erstare the sternest eyes that look,
==28== Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
==29== Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
==30== Yea, mock the lion when ’a roars for prey,
==31== To win thee, lady. But alas the while!
==32== If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
==33== Which is the better man, the greater throw
==34== May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
==35== So is Alcides beaten by his rage,
==36== And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
==37== Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
==38== And die with grieving.

**POR.**
==38==            You must take your chance,
==39== And either not attempt to choose at all,
==40== Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
==41== Never to speak to lady afterward
==42== In way of marriage; therefore be advis’d.

**MOR.**
==43== Nor will not. Come bring me unto my chance.

**POR.**
==44== First, forward to the temple; after dinner
==45== Your hazard shall be made.

**MOR.**
==45==               Good fortune then!
==46== To make me blest or cursed’st among men.

*Cornets. Exeunt.*
