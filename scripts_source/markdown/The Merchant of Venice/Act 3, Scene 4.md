## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.*

*Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica, and Balthazar, a man of Portia’s.*

**LOR.**
==1==Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
==2==You have a noble and a true conceit
==3==Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly
==4==In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
==5==But if you knew to whom you show this honor,
==6==How true a gentleman you send relief,
==7==How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
==8==I know you would be prouder of the work
==9==Than customary bounty can enforce you.

**POR.**
==10==I never did repent for doing good,
==11==Nor shall not now: for in companions
==12==That do converse and waste the time together,
==13==Whose souls do bear an egall yoke of love,
==14==There must be needs a like proportion
==15==Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit;
==16==Which makes me think that this Antonio,
==17==Being the bosom lover of my lord,
==18==Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
==19==How little is the cost I have bestowed
==20==In purchasing the semblance of my soul,
==21==From out the state of hellish cruelty.
==22==This comes too near the praising of myself,
==23==Therefore no more of it. Hear other things:
==24==Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
==25==The husbandry and manage of my house
==26==Until my lord’s return. For mine own part,
==27==I have toward heaven breath’d a secret vow
==28==To live in prayer and contemplation,
==29==Only attended by Nerissa here,
==30==Until her husband and my lord’s return.
==31==There is a monast’ry two miles off,
==32==And there we will abide. I do desire you
==33==Not to deny this imposition,
==34==The which my love and some necessity
==35==Now lays upon you.

**LOR.**
==35==           Madam, with all my heart,
==36==I shall obey you in all fair commands.

**POR.**
==37==My people do already know my mind,
==38==And will acknowledge you and Jessica
==39==In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
==40==So fare you well till we shall meet again.

**LOR.**
==41==Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

**JES.**
==42==I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.

**POR.**
==43==I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas’d
==44==To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.
*(Exeunt Jessica and Lorenzo.)*
==45==Now, Balthazar,
==46==As I have ever found thee honest-true,
==47==So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
==48==And use thou all th’ endeavor of a man
==49==In speed to Padua. See thou render this
==50==Into my cousin’s hands, Doctor Bellario,
==51==And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,
==52==Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin’d speed
==53==Unto the traject, to the common ferry
==54==Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
==55==But get thee gone. I shall be there before thee.

**BALTH.**
==56==Madam, I go with all convenient speed.

*Exit.*

**POR.**
==57==Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand
==58==That you yet know not of. We’ll see our husbands
==59==Before they think of us.

**NER.**
==59==              Shall they see us?

**POR.**
==60==They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit
==61==That they shall think we are accomplished
==62==With that we lack. I’ll hold thee any wager,
==63==When we are both accoutered like young men,
==64==I’ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
==65==And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
==66==And speak between the change of man and boy
==67==With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
==68==Into a manly stride; and speak of frays
==69==Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
==70==How honorable ladies sought my love,
==71==Which I denying, they fell sick and died.
==72==I could not do withal. Then I’ll repent,
==73==And wish, for all that, that I had not kill’d them;
==74==And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,
==75==That men shall swear I have discontinued school
==76==Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
==77==A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
==78==Which I will practice.

**NER.**
==78==           Why, shall we turn to men?

**POR.**
==79==Fie, what a question’s that,
==80==If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
==81==But come, I’ll tell thee all my whole device
==82==When I am in my coach, which stays for us
==83==At the park-gate; and therefore haste away,
==84==For we must measure twenty miles today.

*Exeunt.*
