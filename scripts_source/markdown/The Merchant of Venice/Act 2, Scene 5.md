## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Venice. Before Shylock’s house.*

*Enter Shylock the Jew and his man that was, the Clown Launcelot.*

**SHY.**
Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.⁠—
What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gurmandize,
As thou hast done with me—What, Jessica!⁠—
And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out⁠—
Why, Jessica, I say!

**LAUN.**
           Why, Jessica!

**SHY.**
Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.

**LAUN.**
Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding.

*Enter Jessica.*

**JES.**
Call you? What is your will?

**SHY.**
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.
There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
I am not bid for love, they flatter me,
But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon
The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
Look to my house. I am right loath to go;
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
For I did dream of money-bags tonight.

**LAUN.**
I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach.

**SHY.**
So do I his.

**LAUN.**
And they have conspir’d together. I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six a’ clock i’ th’ morning, falling out that year on Ash We’n’sday was four year in th’ afternoon.

**SHY.**
What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum
And the vile squealing of the wry-neck’d fife,
Clamber not you up to the casements then,
Nor thrust your head into the public street
To gaze on Christian fools with varnish’d faces;
But stop my house’s ears, I mean my casements;
Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter
My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear
I have no mind of feasting forth tonight;
But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah,
Say I will come.

**LAUN.**
I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for all this⁠—
    There will come a Christian by,
    Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.

*Exit.*

**SHY.**
What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?

**JES.**
His words were “Farewell, mistress!”—nothing else.

**SHY.**
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
More than the wild-cat. Drones hive not with me,
Therefore I part with him, and part with him
To one that I would have him help to waste
His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in,
Perhaps I will return immediately.
Do as I bid you, shut doors after you;
Fast bind, fast find⁠—
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

*Exit.*

**JES.**
Farewell, and if my fortune be not cross’d,
I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

*Exit.*
