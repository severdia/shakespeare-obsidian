## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Venice. Before Shylock’s house.*

*Enter Shylock the Jew and his man that was, the Clown Launcelot.*

**SHY.**
==1== Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
==2== The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.⁠—
==3== What, Jessica!—Thou shalt not gurmandize,
==4== As thou hast done with me—What, Jessica!⁠—
==5== And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out⁠—
==6== Why, Jessica, I say!

**LAUN.**
==6==            Why, Jessica!

**SHY.**
==7== Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.

**LAUN.**
==8== Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding.

*Enter Jessica.*

**JES.**
==9== Call you? What is your will?

**SHY.**
==10== I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.
==11== There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
==12== I am not bid for love, they flatter me,
==13== But yet I’ll go in hate, to feed upon
==14== The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
==15== Look to my house. I am right loath to go;
==16== There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
==17== For I did dream of money-bags tonight.

**LAUN.**
==18== I beseech you, sir, go. My young master doth expect your reproach.

**SHY.**
==19== So do I his.

**LAUN.**
==20== And they have conspir’d together. I will not say you shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six a’ clock i’ th’ morning, falling out that year on Ash We’n’sday was four year in th’ afternoon.

**SHY.**
==21== What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
==22== Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum
==23== And the vile squealing of the wry-neck’d fife,
==24== Clamber not you up to the casements then,
==25== Nor thrust your head into the public street
==26== To gaze on Christian fools with varnish’d faces;
==27== But stop my house’s ears, I mean my casements;
==28== Let not the sound of shallow fopp’ry enter
==29== My sober house. By Jacob’s staff I swear
==30== I have no mind of feasting forth tonight;
==31== But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah,
==32== Say I will come.

**LAUN.**
==33== I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window for all this⁠—
==33==     There will come a Christian by,
==33==     Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.

*Exit.*

**SHY.**
==34== What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?

**JES.**
==35== His words were “Farewell, mistress!”—nothing else.

**SHY.**
==36== The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,
==37== Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
==38== More than the wild-cat. Drones hive not with me,
==39== Therefore I part with him, and part with him
==40== To one that I would have him help to waste
==41== His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in,
==42== Perhaps I will return immediately.
==43== Do as I bid you, shut doors after you;
==44== Fast bind, fast find⁠—
==45== A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

*Exit.*

**JES.**
==46== Farewell, and if my fortune be not cross’d,
==47== I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

*Exit.*
