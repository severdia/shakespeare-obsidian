## Act 2, Scene 8
[[Act 2, Scene 7|← Act 2, Scene 7]] | [[Act 2, Scene 9|Act 2, Scene 9 →]]

*Venice. A street.*

*Enter Salerio and Solanio.*

**SAL.**
==1==Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail,
==2==With him is Gratiano gone along;
==3==And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.

**SOL.**
==4==The villain Jew with outcries rais’d the Duke,
==5==Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.

**SAL.**
==6==He came too late, the ship was under sail,
==7==But there the Duke was given to understand
==8==That in a gondola were seen together
==9==Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.
==10==Besides, Antonio certified the Duke
==11==They were not with Bassanio in his ship.

**SOL.**
==12==I never heard a passion so confus’d,
==13==So strange, outrageous, and so variable
==14==As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.
==15==“My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
==16==Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
==17==Justice! The law! My ducats, and my daughter!
==18==A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
==19==Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter!
==20==And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
==21==Stol’n by my daughter! Justice! Find the girl,
==22==She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.”

**SAL.**
==23==Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
==24==Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.

**SOL.**
==25==Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
==26==Or he shall pay for this.

**SAL.**
==26==              Marry, well rememb’red.
==27==I reason’d with a Frenchman yesterday,
==28==Who told me, in the Narrow Seas that part
==29==The French and English, there miscarried
==30==A vessel of our country richly fraught.
==31==I thought upon Antonio when he told me,
==32==And wish’d in silence that it were not his.

**SOL.**
==33==You were best to tell Antonio what you hear,
==34==Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

**SAL.**
==35==A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
==36==I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
==37==Bassanio told him he would make some speed
==38==Of his return; he answered, “Do not so,
==39==Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,
==40==But stay the very riping of the time;
==41==And for the Jew’s bond which he hath of me,
==42==Let it not enter in your mind of love.
==43==Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
==44==To courtship, and such fair ostents of love
==45==As shall conveniently become you there.”
==46==And even there, his eye being big with tears,
==47==Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
==48==And with affection wondrous sensible
==49==He wrung Bassanio’s hand, and so they parted.

**SOL.**
==50==I think he only loves the world for him.
==51==I pray thee let us go and find him out
==52==And quicken his embraced heaviness
==53==With some delight or other.

**SAL.**
==53==              Do we so.

*Exeunt.*
