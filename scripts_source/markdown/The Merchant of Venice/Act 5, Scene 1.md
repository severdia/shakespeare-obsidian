## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]]

*Belmont. Outside Portia’s house.*

*Enter Lorenzo and Jessica.*

**LOR.**
==1==The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,
==2==When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,
==3==And they did make no noise, in such a night
==4==Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls,
==5==And sigh’d his soul toward the Grecian tents,
==6==Where Cressid lay that night.

**JES.**
==6==                In such a night
==7==Did Thisby fearfully o’ertrip the dew,
==8==And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself,
==9==And ran dismayed away.

**LOR.**
==9==              In such a night
==10==Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
==11==Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love
==12==To come again to Carthage.

**JES.**
==12==              In such a night
==13==Medea gathered the enchanted herbs
==14==That did renew old Aeson.

**LOR.**
==14==              In such a night
==15==Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,
==16==And with an unthrift love did run from Venice,
==17==As far as Belmont.

**JES.**
==17==           In such a night
==18==Did young Lorenzo swear he lov’d her well,
==19==Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
==20==And ne’er a true one.

**LOR.**
==20==           In such a night
==21==Did pretty Jessica (like a little shrew) 
==22==Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

**JES.**
==23==I would out-night you, did nobody come;
==24==But hark, I hear the footing of a man.

*Enter Stephano.*

**LOR.**
==25==Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

**STEPH.**
==26==A friend.

**LOR.**
==27==A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?

**STEPH.**
==28==Stephano is my name, and I bring word
==29==My mistress will before the break of day
==30==Be here at Belmont. She doth stray about
==31==By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
==32==For happy wedlock hours.

**LOR.**
==32==              Who comes with her?

**STEPH.**
==33==None but a holy hermit and her maid.
==34==I pray you, is my master yet return’d?

**LOR.**
==35==He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
==36==But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
==37==And ceremoniously let us prepare
==38==Some welcome for the mistress of the house.

*Enter Clown Launcelot.*

**LAUN.**
==39==Sola, sola! Wo ha, ho! Sola, sola!

**LOR.**
==40==Who calls?

**LAUN.**
==41==Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!

**LOR.**
==42==Leave hollowing, man—here.

**LAUN.**
==43==Sola! Where, where?

**LOR.**
==44==Here!

**LAUN.**
==45==Tell him there’s a post come from my master, with his horn full of good news. My master will be here ere morning.

*Exit.*

**LOR.**
==46==Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming.
==47==And yet no matter; why should we go in?
==48==My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
==49==Within the house, your mistress is at hand,
==50==And bring your music forth into the air.
*(Exit Stephano.)*
==51==How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
==52==Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music
==53==Creep in our ears. Soft stillness and the night
==54==Become the touches of sweet harmony.
==55==Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
==56==Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.
==57==There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st
==58==But in his motion like an angel sings,
==59==Still quiring to the young-ey’d cherubins;
==60==Such harmony is in immortal souls,
==61==But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
==62==Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
*(Enter Musicians.)*
==63==Come ho, and wake Diana with a hymn,
==64==With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,
==65==And draw her home with music.

*Play Music.*

**JES.**
==66==I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

**LOR.**
==67==The reason is, your spirits are attentive;
==68==For do but note a wild and wanton herd
==69==Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
==70==Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
==71==Which is the hot condition of their blood,
==72==If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
==73==Or any air of music touch their ears,
==74==You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
==75==Their savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze,
==76==By the sweet power of music; therefore the poet
==77==Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;
==78==Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
==79==But music for the time doth change his nature.
==80==The man that hath no music in himself,
==81==Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
==82==Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
==83==The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
==84==And his affections dark as Erebus
==85==Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

*Enter Portia and Nerissa.*

**POR.**
==86==That light we see is burning in my hall.
==87==How far that little candle throws his beams!
==88==So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

**NER.**
==89==When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

**POR.**
==90==So doth the greater glory dim the less:
==91==A substitute shines brightly as a king
==92==Until a king be by, and then his state
==93==Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
==94==Into the main of waters. Music, hark!

**NER.**
==95==It is your music, madam, of the house.

**POR.**
==96==Nothing is good, I see, without respect;
==97==Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

**NER.**
==98==Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

**POR.**
==99==The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark
==100==When neither is attended; and I think
==101==The nightingale, if she should sing by day
==102==When every goose is cackling, would be thought
==103==No better a musician than the wren.
==104==How many things by season season’d are
==105==To their right praise and true perfection!
==106==Peace ho! The Moon sleeps with Endymion,
==107==And would not be awak’d.

*Music ceases.*

**LOR.**
==107==              That is the voice,
==108==Or I am much deceiv’d, of Portia.

**POR.**
==109==He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
==110==By the bad voice!

**LOR.**
==110==           Dear lady, welcome home!

**POR.**
==111==We have been praying for our husbands’ welfare,
==112==Which speed we hope the better for our words.
==113==Are they return’d?

**LOR.**
==113==           Madam, they are not yet;
==114==But there is come a messenger before,
==115==To signify their coming.

**POR.**
==115==              Go in, Nerissa.
==116==Give order to my servants that they take
==117==No note at all of our being absent hence⁠—
==118==Nor you, Lorenzo—Jessica, nor you.

*A tucket sounds.*

**LOR.**
==119==Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet.
==120==We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.

**POR.**
==121==This night methinks is but the daylight sick,
==122==It looks a little paler. ’Tis a day,
==123==Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

*Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano, and their Followers.*

**BASS.**
==124==We should hold day with the Antipodes,
==125==If you would walk in absence of the sun.

**POR.**
==126==Let me give light, but let me not be light,
==127==For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
==128==And never be Bassanio so for me⁠—
==129==But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.

**BASS.**
==130==I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend;
==131==This is the man, this is Antonio,
==132==To whom I am so infinitely bound.

**POR.**
==133==You should in all sense be much bound to him,
==134==For as I hear he was much bound for you.

**ANT.**
==135==No more than I am well acquitted of.

**POR.**
==136==Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
==137==It must appear in other ways than words,
==138==Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

**GRA.**
*(To Nerissa.)*
==139==By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
==140==In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk.
==141==Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
==142==Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

**POR.**
==143==A quarrel ho already! What’s the matter?

**GRA.**
==144==About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
==145==That she did give me, whose posy was
==146==For all the world like cutler’s poetry
==147==Upon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.”

**NER.**
==148==What talk you of the posy or the value?
==149==You swore to me, when I did give it you,
==150==That you would wear it till your hour of death,
==151==And that it should lie with you in your grave.
==152==Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
==153==You should have been respective and have kept it.
==154==Gave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge,
==155==The clerk will ne’er wear hair on ’s face that had it.

**GRA.**
==156==He will, and if he live to be a man.

**NER.**
==157==Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

**GRA.**
==158==Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
==159==A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
==160==No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,
==161==A prating boy, that begg’d it as a fee.
==162==I could not for my heart deny it him.

**POR.**
==163==You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
==164==To part so slightly with your wive’s first gift,
==165==A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,
==166==And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
==167==I gave my love a ring, and made him swear
==168==Never to part with it, and here he stands.
==169==I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it,
==170==Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
==171==That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
==172==You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief;
==173==And ’twere to me I should be mad at it.

**BASS.**
*(Aside.)*
==174==Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
==175==And swear I lost the ring defending it.

**GRA.**
==176==My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
==177==Unto the judge that begg’d it, and indeed
==178==Deserv’d it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
==179==That took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine,
==180==And neither man nor master would take aught
==181==But the two rings.

**POR.**
==181==           What ring gave you, my lord?
==182==Not that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me.

**BASS.**
==183==If I could add a lie unto a fault,
==184==I would deny it; but you see my finger
==185==Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.

**POR.**
==186==Even so void is your false heart of truth.
==187==By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed
==188==Until I see the ring!

**NER.**
==188==           Nor I in yours
==189==Till I again see mine!

**BASS.**
==189==           Sweet Portia,
==190==If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
==191==If you did know for whom I gave the ring,
==192==And would conceive for what I gave the ring,
==193==And how unwillingly I left the ring,
==194==When nought would be accepted but the ring,
==195==You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

**POR.**
==196==If you had known the virtue of the ring,
==197==Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
==198==Or your own honor to contain the ring,
==199==You would not then have parted with the ring.
==200==What man is there so much unreasonable,
==201==If you had pleas’d to have defended it
==202==With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
==203==To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
==204==Nerissa teaches me what to believe⁠—
==205==I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring!

**BASS.**
==206==No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,
==207==No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
==208==Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,
==209==And begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him,
==210==And suffer’d him to go displeas’d away⁠—
==211==Even he that had held up the very life
==212==Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
==213==I was enforc’d to send it after him,
==214==I was beset with shame and courtesy,
==215==My honor would not let ingratitude
==216==So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,
==217==For by these blessed candles of the night,
==218==Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d
==219==The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

**POR.**
==220==Let not that doctor e’er come near my house.
==221==Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
==222==And that which you did swear to keep for me,
==223==I will become as liberal as you,
==224==I’ll not deny him any thing I have,
==225==No, not my body nor my husband’s bed.
==226==Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
==227==Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus;
==228==If you do not, if I be left alone,
==229==Now by mine honor, which is yet mine own,
==230==I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

**NER.**
==231==And I his clerk; therefore be well advis’d
==232==How you do leave me to mine own protection.

**GRA.**
==233==Well, do you so; let not me take him then,
==234==For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.

**ANT.**
==235==I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.

**POR.**
==236==Sir, grieve not you, you are welcome notwithstanding.

**BASS.**
==237==Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,
==238==And in the hearing of these many friends
==239==I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
==240==Wherein I see myself⁠—

**POR.**
==240==              Mark you but that!
==241==In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,
==242==In each eye, one. Swear by your double self,
==243==And there’s an oath of credit.

**BASS.**
==243==                Nay, but hear me.
==244==Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
==245==I never more will break an oath with thee.

**ANT.**
==246==I once did lend my body for his wealth,
==247==Which but for him that had your husband’s ring
==248==Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,
==249==My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
==250==Will never more break faith advisedly.

**POR.**
==251==Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,
==252==And bid him keep it better than the other.

**ANT.**
==253==Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.

**BASS.**
==254==By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

**POR.**
==255==I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,
==256==For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

**NER.**
==257==And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,
==258==For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,
==259==In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

**GRA.**
==260==Why, this is like the mending of highways
==261==In summer, where the ways are fair enough.
==262==What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?

**POR.**
==263==Speak not so grossly, you are all amaz’d.
==264==Here is a letter, read it at your leisure.
==265==It comes from Padua, from Bellario.
==266==There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
==267==Nerissa there her clerk. Lorenzo here
==268==Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,
==269==And even but now return’d; I have not yet
==270==Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,
==271==And I have better news in store for you
==272==Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon;
==273==There you shall find three of your argosies
==274==Are richly come to harbor suddenly.
==275==You shall not know by what strange accident
==276==I chanced on this letter.

**ANT.**
==276==              I am dumb.

**BASS.**
==277==Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?

**GRA.**
==278==Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

**NER.**
==279==Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
==280==Unless he live until he be a man.

**BASS.**
==281==Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow⁠—
==282==When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

**ANT.**
==283==Sweet lady, you have given me life and living,
==284==For here I read for certain that my ships
==285==Are safely come to road.

**POR.**
==285==              How now, Lorenzo?
==286==My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

**NER.**
==287==Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.
==288==There do I give to you and Jessica,
==289==From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
==290==After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.

**LOR.**
==291==Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
==292==Of starved people.

**POR.**
==292==           It is almost morning,
==293==And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
==294==Of these events at full. Let us go in,
==295==And charge us there upon inter’gatories,
==296==And we will answer all things faithfully.

**GRA.**
==297==Let it be so. The first inter’gatory
==298==That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
==299==Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
==300==Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.
==301==But were the day come, I should wish it dark
==302==Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.
==303==Well, while I live I’ll fear no other thing
==304==So sore, as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.

*Exeunt.*
