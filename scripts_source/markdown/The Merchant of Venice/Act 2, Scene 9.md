## Act 2, Scene 9
[[Act 2, Scene 8|← Act 2, Scene 8]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.*

*Enter Nerissa and a servant.*

**NER.**
==1==Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;
==2==The Prince of Arragon hath ta’en his oath,
==3==And comes to his election presently.

*Flourish cornets. Enter the Prince of Arragon, his Train, and Portia.*

**POR.**
==4==Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince
==5==If you choose that wherein I am contain’d,
==6==Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz’d;
==7==But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
==8==You must be gone from hence immediately.

**AR.**
==9==I am enjoin’d by oath to observe three things:
==10==First, never to unfold to any one
==11==Which casket ’twas I chose; next, if I fail
==12==Of the right casket, never in my life
==13==To woo a maid in way of marriage;
==14==Lastly,
==15==If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
==16==Immediately to leave you, and be gone.

**POR.**
==17==To these injunctions every one doth swear
==18==That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

**AR.**
==19==And so have I address’d me. Fortune now
==20==To my heart’s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.
==21==*“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”*
==22==You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
==23==What says the golden chest? Ha, let me see:
==24==*“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”*
==25==What many men desire! That many may be meant
==26==By the fool multitude that choose by show,
==27==Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,
==28==Which pries not to th’ interior, but like the martlet
==29==Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
==30==Even in the force and road of casualty.
==31==I will not choose what many men desire,
==32==Because I will not jump with common spirits,
==33==And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
==34==Why then to thee, thou silver treasure house,
==35==Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
==36==*“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”*
==37==And well said too; for who shall go about
==38==To cozen fortune, and be honorable
==39==Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
==40==To wear an undeserved dignity.
==41==O that estates, degrees, and offices
==42==Were not deriv’d corruptly, and that clear honor
==43==Were purchas’d by the merit of the wearer!
==44==How many then should cover that stand bare?
==45==How many be commanded that command?
==46==How much low peasantry would then be gleaned
==47==From the true seed of honor? And how much honor
==48==Pick’d from the chaff and ruin of the times
==49==To be new varnish’d? Well, but to my choice:
==50==*“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”*
==51==I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
==52==And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

*He unlocks the silver casket.*

**POR.**
==53==Too long a pause for that which you find there.

**AR.**
==54==What’s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot,
==55==Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
==56==How much unlike art thou to Portia!
==57==How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
==58==“Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves”!
==59==Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?
==60==Is that my prize? Are my deserts no better?

**POR.**
==61==To offend and judge are distinct offices,
==62==And of opposed natures.

**AR.**
==62==              What is here?
*(Reads.)*
==63==*“The fire seven times tried this:*
==64==*Seven times tried that judgment is,*
==65==*That did never choose amiss.*
==66==*Some there be that shadows kiss,*
==67==*Such have but a shadow’s bliss.*
==68==*There be fools alive, iwis,*
==69==*Silver’d o’er, and so was this.*
==70==*Take what wife you will to bed,*
==71==*I will ever be your head.*
==72==*So be gone, you are sped.”*
==73==*Still more fool I shall appear*
==74==*By the time I linger here.*
==75==*With one fool’s head I came to woo,*
==76==*But I go away with two.*
==77==*Sweet, adieu. I’ll keep my oath,*
==78==*Patiently to bear my wroth.*

*Exit with his Train.*

**POR.**
==79==Thus hath the candle sing’d the moth.
==80==O, these deliberate fools, when they do choose,
==81==They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

**NER.**
==82==The ancient saying is no heresy,
==83==Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.

**POR.**
==84==Come draw the curtain, Nerissa.

*Enter Stephano.*

**STEPH.**
==85==Where is my lady?

**POR.**
==85==           Here; what would my lord?

**STEPH.**
==86==Madam, there is alighted at your gate
==87==A young Venetian, one that comes before
==88==To signify th’ approaching of his lord,
==89==From whom he bringeth sensible regreets:
==90==To wit (besides commends and courteous breath),
==91==Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
==92==So likely an ambassador of love.
==93==A day in April never came so sweet,
==94==To show how costly summer was at hand,
==95==As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

**POR.**
==96==No more, I pray thee. I am half afeard
==97==Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
==98==Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him.
==99==Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see
==100==Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.

**NER.**
==101==Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!

*Exeunt.*
