## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Venice. A street.*

*Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salerio, and Solanio.*

**LOR.**
==1==Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
==2==Disguise us at my lodging, and return
==3==All in an hour.

**GRA.**
==4==We have not made good preparation.

**SAL.**
==5==We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.

**SOL.**
==6==’Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered,
==7==And better in my mind not undertook.

**LOR.**
==8==’Tis now but four of clock, we have two hours
==9==To furnish us.
*(Enter Launcelot with a letter.)*
==9==        Friend Launcelot, what’s the news?

**LAUN.**
==10==And it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.

**LOR.**
==11==I know the hand; in faith, ’tis a fair hand,
==12==And whiter than the paper it writ on
==13==Is the fair hand that writ.

**GRA.**
==13==              Love-news, in faith.

**LAUN.**
==14==By your leave, sir.

**LOR.**
==15==Whither goest thou?

**LAUN.**
==16==Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.

**LOR.**
==17==Hold here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica
==18==I will not fail her, speak it privately.
*(Exit Clown.)*
==19==Go, gentlemen,
==20==Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
==21==I am provided of a torch-bearer.

**SAL.**
==22==Ay, marry, I’ll be gone about it straight.

**SOL.**
==23==And so will I.

**LOR.**
==23==        Meet me and Gratiano
==24==At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.

**SAL.**
==25==’Tis good we do so.

*Exit with Solanio.*

**GRA.**
==26==Was not that letter from fair Jessica?

**LOR.**
==27==I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
==28==How I shall take her from her father’s house,
==29==What gold and jewels she is furnish’d with,
==30==What page’s suit she hath in readiness.
==31==If e’er the Jew her father come to heaven,
==32==It will be for his gentle daughter’s sake,
==33==And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
==34==Unless she do it under this excuse,
==35==That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
==36==Come go with me, peruse this as thou goest.
==37==Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

*Exeunt.*
