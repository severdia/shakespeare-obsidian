## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Venice. A room in Shylock’s house.*

*Enter Jessica and the Clown Launcelot.*

**JES.**
==1== I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
==2== Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
==3== Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
==4== But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee,
==5== And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
==6== Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.
==7== Give him this letter, do it secretly,
==8== And so farewell. I would not have my father
==9== See me in talk with thee.

**LAUN.**
==10== *Adieu*, tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceiv’d. But *adieu*, these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit. *Adieu*!

**JES.**
==11== Farewell, good Launcelot.
*(Exit Launcelot.)*
==12== Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
==13== To be ashamed to be my father’s child!
==14== But though I am a daughter to his blood,
==15== I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
==16== If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
==17== Become a Christian and thy loving wife.

*Exit.*
