## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Venice. A street.*

*Enter Antonio, Salerio, and Solanio.*

**ANT.**
==1== In sooth, I know not why I am so sad;
==2== It wearies me, you say it wearies you;
==3== But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
==4== What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,
==5== I am to learn;
==6== And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
==7== That I have much ado to know myself.

**SAL.**
==8== Your mind is tossing on the ocean,
==9== There where your argosies with portly sail
==10== Like *signior*s and rich burghers on the flood,
==11== Or as it were the pageants of the sea,
==12== Do overpeer the petty traffickers
==13== That cur’sy to them, do them reverence,
==14== As they fly by them with their woven wings.

**SOL.**
==15== Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
==16== The better part of my affections would
==17== Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
==18== Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,
==19== Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;
==20== And every object that might make me fear
==21== Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
==22== Would make me sad.

**SAL.**
==22==            My wind cooling my broth
==23== Would blow me to an ague when I thought
==24== What harm a wind too great might do at sea.
==25== I should not see the sandy hour-glass run
==26== But I should think of shallows and of flats,
==27== And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,
==28== Vailing her high top lower than her ribs
==29== To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
==30== And see the holy edifice of stone,
==31== And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
==32== Which touching but my gentle vessel’s side
==33== Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
==34== Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
==35== And in a word, but even now worth this,
==36== And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
==37== To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
==38== That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad?
==39== But tell not me; I know Antonio
==40== Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

**ANT.**
==41== Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,
==42== My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
==43== Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
==44== Upon the fortune of this present year:
==45== Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

**SOL.**
==46== Why then you are in love.

**ANT.**
==46==               Fie, fie!

**SOL.**
==47== Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad
==48== Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy
==49== For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry
==50== Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Janus,
==51== Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time:
==52== Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,
==53== And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper;
==54== And other of such vinegar aspect
==55== That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile
==56== Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
*(Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and Gratiano.)*
==57== Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
==58== Gratiano, and Lorenzo. Fare ye well,
==59== We leave you now with better company.

**SAL.**
==60== I would have stay’d till I had made you merry,
==61== If worthier friends had not prevented me.

**ANT.**
==62== Your worth is very dear in my regard.
==63== I take it your own business calls on you,
==64== And you embrace th’ occasion to depart.

**SAL.**
==65== Good morrow, my good lords.

**BASS.**
==66== Good *signior*s both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?
==67== You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?

**SAL.**
==68== We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.

*Exeunt Salerio and Solanio.*

**LOR.**
==69== My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
==70== We two will leave you, but at dinner-time
==71== I pray you have in mind where we must meet.

**BASS.**
==72== I will not fail you.

**GRA.**
==73== You look not well, *Signior* Antonio,
==74== You have too much respect upon the world.
==75== They lose it that do buy it with much care.
==76== Believe me you are marvelously chang’d.

**ANT.**
==77== I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,
==78== A stage, where every man must play a part,
==79== And mine a sad one.

**GRA.**
==79==            Let me play the fool,
==80== With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
==81== And let my liver rather heat with wine
==82== Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
==83== Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
==84== Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
==85== Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundies
==86== By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio⁠—
==87== I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks⁠—
==88== There are a sort of men whose visages
==89== Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
==90== And do a willful stillness entertain,
==91== With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion
==92== Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
==93== As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle,
==94== And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!”
==95== O my Antonio, I do know of these
==96== That therefore only are reputed wise
==97== For saying nothing; when I am very sure
==98== If they should speak, would almost damn those ears
==99== Which hearing them would call their brothers fools.
==100== I’ll tell thee more of this another time;
==101== But fish not with this melancholy bait
==102== For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
==103== Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while,
==104== I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.

**LOR.**
==105== Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.
==106== I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
==107== For Gratiano never lets me speak.

**GRA.**
==108== Well, keep me company but two years more,
==109== Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.

**ANT.**
==110== Fare you well! I’ll grow a talker for this gear.

**GRA.**
==111== Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable
==112== In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.

*Exeunt Gratiano and Lorenzo.*

**ANT.**
==113== It is that—any thing now!

**BASS.**
==114== Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff; you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them, they are not worth the search.

**ANT.**
==115== Well, tell me now what lady is the same
==116== To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
==117== That you today promis’d to tell me of?

**BASS.**
==118== ’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
==119== How much I have disabled mine estate,
==120== By something showing a more swelling port
==121== Than my faint means would grant continuance.
==122== Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d
==123== From such a noble rate, but my chief care
==124== Is to come fairly off from the great debts
==125== Wherein my time something too prodigal
==126== Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio,
==127== I owe the most in money and in love,
==128== And from your love I have a warranty
==129== To unburden all my plots and purposes
==130== How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

**ANT.**
==131== I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it,
==132== And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
==133== Within the eye of honor, be assur’d
==134== My purse, my person, my extremest means,
==135== Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.

**BASS.**
==136== In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
==137== I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
==138== The self-same way with more advised watch
==139== To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
==140== I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,
==141== Because what follows is pure innocence.
==142== I owe you much, and like a willful youth,
==143== That which I owe is lost, but if you please
==144== To shoot another arrow that self way
==145== Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
==146== As I will watch the aim, or to find both
==147== Or bring your latter hazard back again,
==148== And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

**ANT.**
==149== You know me well, and herein spend but time
==150== To wind about my love with circumstance,
==151== And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
==152== In making question of my uttermost
==153== Than if you had made waste of all I have.
==154== Then do but say to me what I should do
==155== That in your knowledge may by me be done,
==156== And I am prest unto it; therefore speak.

**BASS.**
==157== In Belmont is a lady richly left,
==158== And she is fair and, fairer than that word,
==159== Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes
==160== I did receive fair speechless messages.
==161== Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d
==162== To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.
==163== Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
==164== For the four winds blow in from every coast
==165== Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
==166== Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,
==167== Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchis’ strond,
==168== And many Jasons come in quest of her.
==169== O my Antonio, had I but the means
==170== To hold a rival place with one of them,
==171== I have a mind presages me such thrift
==172== That I should questionless be fortunate!

**ANT.**
==173== Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea,
==174== Neither have I money nor commodity
==175== To raise a present sum; therefore go forth,
==176== Try what my credit can in Venice do.
==177== That shall be rack’d, even to the uttermost,
==178== To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
==179== Go presently inquire, and so will I,
==180== Where money is, and I no question make
==181== To have it of my trust, or for my sake.

*Exeunt.*
