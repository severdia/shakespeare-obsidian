## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Prologue|Act 2, Prologue →]]

*Tarsus. A room in the Governor’s house.*

*Enter Cleon, the Governor of Tharsus, with his wife Dionyza and others.*

**CLE.**
==1==My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
==2==And by relating tales of others’ griefs,
==3==See if ’twill teach us to forget our own?

**DION.**
==4==That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it,
==5==For who digs hills because they do aspire
==6==Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
==7==O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
==8==Here they are but felt, and seen with mischief’s eyes,
==9==But like to groves, being topp’d, they higher rise.

**CLE.**
==10==O Dionyza!
==11==Who wanteth food and will not say he wants it,
==12==Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
==13==Our tongues and sorrows to sound deep our woes
==14==Into the air, our eyes to weep, till tongues
==15==Fetch breath that may proclaim them louder, that
==16==If heaven slumber, while their creatures want,
==17==They may awake their helpers to comfort them.
==18==I’ll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
==19==And wanting breath to speak, help me with tears.

**DION.**
==20==I’ll do my best, sir.

**CLE.**
==21==This Tharsus, o’er which I have the government,
==22==A city on whom plenty held full hand,
==23==For riches strew’d herself even in her streets;
==24==Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss’d the clouds,
==25==And strangers ne’er beheld but wond’red at;
==26==Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn’d,
==27==Like one another’s glass to trim them by;
==28==Their tables were stor’d full, to glad the sight,
==29==And not so much to feed on as delight;
==30==All poverty was scorn’d, and pride so great,
==31==The name of help grew odious to repeat.

**DION.**
==32==O, ’tis too true.

**CLE.**
==33==But see what heaven can do by this our change:
==34==These mouths who, but of late, earth, sea, and air
==35==Were all too little to content and please,
==36==Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
==37==As houses are defil’d for want of use,
==38==They are now starv’d for want of exercise;
==39==Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
==40==Must have inventions to delight the taste,
==41==Would now be glad of bread and beg for it;
==42==Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
==43==Thought nought too curious, are ready now
==44==To eat those little darlings whom they lov’d.
==45==So sharp are hunger’s teeth, that man and wife
==46==Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life.
==47==Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
==48==Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
==49==Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
==50==Is not this true?

**DION.**
==51==Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.

**CLE.**
==52==O, let those cities that of plenty’s cup
==53==And her prosperities so largely taste,
==54==With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
==55==The misery of Tharsus may be theirs.

*Enter a Lord of Tarsus.*

**LORD. TAR.**
==56==Where’s the Lord Governor?

**CLE.**
==57==Here.
==58==Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring’st in haste,
==59==For comfort is too far for us to expect.

**LORD. TAR.**
==60==We have descried, upon our neighboring shore,
==61==A portly sail of ships make hitherward.

**CLE.**
==62==I thought as much.
==63==One sorrow never comes but brings an heir
==64==That may succeed as his inheritor;
==65==And so in ours, some neighboring nation,
==66==Taking advantage of our misery,
==67==Hath stuff’d the hollow vessels with their power
==68==To beat us down, the which are down already,
==69==And make a conquest of unhappy me,
==70==Whereas no glory’s got to overcome.

**LORD. TAR.**
==71==That’s the least fear; for by the semblance
==72==Of their white flags display’d, they bring us peace,
==73==And come to us as favorers, not as foes.

**CLE.**
==74==Thou speak’st like him’s untutor’d to repeat:
==75==Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
==76==But bring they what they will and what they can,
==77==What need we fear?
==78==Our ground’s the lowest, and we are half way there.
==79==Go tell their general we attend him here,
==80==To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
==81==And what he craves.

**LORD. TAR.**
==82==I go, my lord.

*Exit.*

**CLE.**
==83==Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
==84==If wars, we are unable to resist.

*Enter Pericles with Lord and Attendants.*

**PER.**
==85==Lord Governor, for so we hear you are,
==86==Let not our ships and number of our men
==87==Be like a beacon fir’d t’ amaze your eyes.
==88==We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,
==89==And seen the desolation of your streets;
==90==Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
==91==But to relieve them of their heavy load;
==92==And these our ships, you happily may think
==93==Are like the Troyan horse was stuff’d within
==94==With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,
==95==Are stor’d with corn to make your needy bread,
==96==And give them life whom hunger starv’d half dead.

**ALL.**
==97==The gods of Greece protect you!
==98==And we’ll pray for you.

**PER.**
==98==              Arise, I pray you, rise.
==99==We do not look for reverence but for love,
==100==And harborage for ourself, our ships, and men.

**CLE.**
==101==The which when any shall not gratify,
==102==Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
==103==Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
==104==The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
==105==Till when—the which I hope shall ne’er be seen⁠—
==106==Your Grace is welcome to our town and us.

**PER.**
==107==Which welcome we’ll accept; feast here awhile,
==108==Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

*Exeunt.*
