## Epilogue
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]]


*Enter Gower.*

**GOW.**
==1==In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
==2==Of monstrous lust the due and just reward.
==3==In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
==4==Although assail’d with fortune fierce and keen,
==5==    Virtue preserv’d from fell destruction’s blast,
==6==    Led on by heaven, and crown’d with joy at last.
==7==In Helicanus may you well descry
==8==A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.
==9==In reverend Cerimon there well appears
==10==The worth that learned charity aye wears.
==11==    For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
==12==    Had spread his cursed deed, the honor’d name
==13==Of Pericles to rage the city turn,
==14==That him and his they in his palace burn;
==15==The gods for murder seemed so content
==16==To punish, although not done, but meant.
==17==    So, on your patience evermore attending,
==18==    New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.


*Exit.*
