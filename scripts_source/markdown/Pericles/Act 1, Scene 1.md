## Act 1, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Prologue|← Act 1, Prologue]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Antioch (Syria). A room in the palace.*

*Enter Antiochus, Prince Pericles, and Followers.*

**ANT.**
==1==Young Prince of Tyre, you have at large received
==2==The danger of the task you undertake.

**PER.**
==3==I have, Antiochus, and with a soul
==4==Embold’ned with the glory of her praise,
==5==Think death no hazard in this enterprise.

*Music.*

**ANT.**
==6==Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride
==7==For embracements even of Jove himself;
==8==At whose conception, till Lucina reigned,
==9==Nature this dowry gave: to glad her presence,
==10==The senate-house of planets all did sit,
==11==To knit in her their best perfections.

*Enter Antiochus’ Daughter.*

**PER.**
==12==See where she comes, apparelled like the spring,
==13==Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
==14==Of every virtue gives renown to men!
==15==Her face the book of praises, where is read
==16==Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
==17==Sorrow were ever ras’d, and testy wrath
==18==Could never be her mild companion.
==19==You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
==20==That have inflam’d desire in my breast
==21==To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree
==22==(Or die in th’ adventure), be my helps,
==23==As I am son and servant to your will,
==24==To compass such a boundless happiness!

**ANT.**
==25==Prince Pericles⁠—

**PER.**
==26==That would be son to great Antiochus.

**ANT.**
==27==Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
==28==With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch’d;
==29==For death-like dragons here affright thee hard.
==30==Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
==31==Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
==32==And which without desert because thine eye
==33==Presumes to reach, all the whole heap must die.
==34==Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
==35==Drawn by report, advent’rous by desire,
==36==Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
==37==That without covering, save yon field of stars,
==38==Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid’s wars;
==39==And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
==40==For going on death’s net, whom none resist.

**PER.**
==41==Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
==42==My frail mortality to know itself,
==43==And by those fearful objects to prepare
==44==This body, like to them, to what I must;
==45==For death remembered should be like a mirror,
==46==Who tells us life’s but breath, to trust it error.
==47==I’ll make my will then, and as sick men do,
==48==Who know the world, see heaven, but feeling woe,
==49==Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
==50==So I bequeath a happy peace to you
==51==And all good men, as every prince should do;
==52==My riches to the earth from whence they came;
*(To the Princess.)*
==53==But my unspotted fire of love to you.
==54==Thus ready for the way of life or death,
==55==I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.

**ANT.**
==56==Scorning advice, read the conclusion then;
==57==Which read and not expounded, ’tis decreed,
==58==As these before thee, thou thyself shalt bleed.

**DAUGH.**
==59==Of all ’say’d yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
==60==Of all ’say’d yet, I wish thee happiness!

**PER.**
==61==Like a bold champion I assume the lists,
==62==Nor ask advice of any other thought
==63==But faithfulness and courage.
*(Reads.)*
*(The Riddle)*
==64==*I am no viper, yet I feed*
==65==*On mother’s flesh which did me breed.*
==66==*I sought a husband, in which labor*
==67==*I found that kindness in a father.*
==68==*He’s father, son, and husband mild;*
==69==*I mother, wife—and yet his child.*
==70==*How they may be, and yet in two,*
==71==*As you will live, resolve it you.*
*(Aside.)*
==72==Sharp physic is the last. But O you powers!
==73==That gives heaven countless eyes to view men’s acts,
==74==Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
==75==If this be true which makes me pale to read it?
*(Aside to the Princess.)*
==76==Fair glass of light, I lov’d you, and could still,
==77==Were not this glorious casket stor’d with ill.
==78==But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt,
==79==For he’s no man on whom perfections wait
==80==That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
==81==You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;
==82==Who, finger’d to make man his lawful music,
==83==Would draw heaven down, and all the gods to hearken;
==84==But being play’d upon before your time,
==85==Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
==86==Good sooth, I care not for you.

**ANT.**
==87==Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life,
==88==For that’s an article within our law,
==89==As dangerous as the rest. Your time’s expir’d,
==90==Either expound now, or receive your sentence.

**PER.**
==91==Great King,
==92==Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
==93==’Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
==94==Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
==95==He’s more secure to keep it shut than shown;
==96==For vice repeated is like the wand’ring wind,
==97==Blows dust in others’ eyes, to spread itself;
==98==And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
==99==The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear
==100==To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
==101==Copp’d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng’d
==102==By man’s oppression, and the poor worm doth die for’t.
==103==Kings are earth’s gods; in vice their law’s their will;
==104==And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
==105==It is enough you know, and it is fit,
==106==What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
==107==All love the womb that their first being bred,
==108==Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.

**ANT.**
*(Aside.)*
==109==Heaven, that I had thy head! He has found the meaning.
==110==But I will gloze with him.—Young Prince of Tyre,
==111==Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
==112==Your exposition misinterpreting,
==113==We might proceed to cancel of your days;
==114==Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
==115==As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise.
==116==Forty days longer we do respite you;
==117==If by which time our secret be undone,
==118==This mercy shows we’ll joy in such a son;
==119==And until then your entertain shall be
==120==As doth befit our honor and your worth.

*Exeunt. Manet Pericles solus.*

**PER.**
==121==How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
==122==When what is done is like an hypocrite,
==123==The which is good in nothing but in sight!
==124==If it be true that I interpret false,
==125==Then were it certain you were not so bad
==126==As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
==127==Where now you’re both a father and a son
==128==By your uncomely claspings with your child
==129==(Which pleasures fits a husband, not a father),
==130==And she an eater of her mother’s flesh
==131==By the defiling of her parent’s bed;
==132==And both like serpents are, who though they feed
==133==On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
==134==Antioch, farewell, for wisdom sees those men
==135==Blush not in actions blacker than the night
==136==Will ’schew no course to keep them from the light.
==137==One sin, I know, another doth provoke:
==138==Murder’s as near to lust as flame to smoke;
==139==Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
==140==Ay, and the targets to put off the shame;
==141==Then lest my life be cropp’d to keep you clear,
==142==By flight I’ll shun the danger which I fear.

*Exit.*

*Enter Antiochus.*

**ANT.**
==143==He hath found the meaning,
==144==For which we mean to have his head.
==145==He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
==146==Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
==147==In such a loathed manner;
==148==And therefore instantly this prince must die,
==149==For by his fall my honor must keep high.
==150==Who attends us there?

*Enter Thaliard.*

**THAL.**
==150==              Doth your Highness call?

**ANT.**
==151==Thaliard—you are of our chamber, Thaliard,
==152==And our mind partakes her private actions
==153==To your secrecy; and for your faithfulness
==154==We will advance you, Thaliard. Behold,
==155==Here’s poison and here’s gold; we hate the Prince
==156==Of Tyre, and thou must kill him. It fits thee not
==157==To ask the reason why, because we bid it.
==158==Say, is it done?

**THAL.**
==158==        My lord, ’tis done.

**ANT.**
==158==                  Enough.
*(Enter an Antiochan Messenger.)*
==159==Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.

**ANT. MESS.**
==160==My lord, Prince Pericles is fled.

*Exit.*

**ANT.**
==160==                  As thou
==161==Wilt live, fly after, and like an arrow shot
==162==From a well-experienc’d archer hits the mark
==163==His eye doth level at, so thou never return
==164==Unless thou say Prince Pericles is dead.

**THAL.**
==165==My lord,
==166==If I can get him within my pistol’s length,
==167==I’ll make him sure enough; so farewell to your Highness.

**ANT.**
==168==Thaliard, *adieu*!
*(Exit Thaliard.)*
==168==           Till Pericles be dead,
==169==My heart can lend no succor to my head.

*Exit.*
