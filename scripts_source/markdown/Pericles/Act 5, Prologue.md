## Act 5, Prologue
[[Act 4, Scene 6|← Act 4, Scene 6]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Gower.*

**GOW.**
==1==Marina thus the brothel scapes, and chances
==2==Into an honest house, our story says.
==3==She sings like one immortal, and she dances
==4==As goddess-like to her admired lays.
==5==Deep clerks she dumbs, and with her neele composes
==6==Nature’s own shape of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
==7==That even her art sisters the natural roses;
==8==Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry,
==9==That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
==10==Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
==11==She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place,
==12==And to her father turn our thoughts again,
==13==Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost,
==14==Where, driven before the winds, he is arriv’d
==15==Here where his daughter dwells, and on this coast
==16==Suppose him now at anchor. The city striv’d
==17==God Neptune’s annual feast to keep, from whence
==18==Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
==19==His banners sable, trimm’d with rich expense,
==20==And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
==21==In your supposing once more put your sight:
==22==Of heavy Pericles think this his bark;
==23==Where what is done in action, more, if might,
==24==Shall be discover’d, please you sit and hark.


*Exit.*
