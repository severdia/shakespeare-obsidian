## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Prologue|Act 3, Prologue →]]

*Pentapolis. A room in the palace.*

*Enter the King Simonides, reading of a letter, at one door; the Knights meet him.*

**1. KNIGHT.**
==1==Good morrow to the good Simonides.

**SIM.**
==2==Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
==3==That for this twelvemonth she’ll not undertake
==4==A married life.
==5==Her reason to herself is only known,
==6==Which from her by no means can I get.

**2. KNIGHT.**
==7==May we not get access to her, my lord?

**SIM.**
==8==Faith, by no means, she hath so strictly tied
==9==Her to her chamber, that ’tis impossible.
==10==One twelve moons more she’ll wear Diana’s livery;
==11==This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vowed,
==12==And on her virgin honor will not break it.

**3. KNIGHT.**
==13==Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.

*Exeunt Knights.*

**SIM.**
==14==So,
==15==They are well dispatch’d; now to my daughter’s letter.
==16==She tells me here, she’ll wed the stranger knight,
==17==Or never more to view nor day nor light.
==18==’Tis well, mistress, your choice agrees with mine;
==19==I like that well. Nay, how absolute she’s in’t,
==20==Not minding whether I dislike or no!
==21==Well, I do commend her choice,
==22==And will no longer have it be delayed.
==23==Soft, here he comes, I must dissemble it.

*Enter Pericles.*

**PER.**
==24==All fortune to the good Simonides!

**SIM.**
==25==To you as much! Sir, I am beholding to you
==26==For your sweet music this last night. I do
==27==Protest my ears were never better fed
==28==With such delightful pleasing harmony.

**PER.**
==29==It is your Grace’s pleasure to commend,
==30==Not my desert.

**SIM.**
==30==        Sir, you are music’s master.

**PER.**
==31==The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.

**SIM.**
==32==Let me ask you one thing:
==33==What do you think of my daughter, sir?

**PER.**
==34==A most virtuous princess.

**SIM.**
==35==And she is fair too, is she not?

**PER.**
==36==As a fair day in summer; wondrous fair.

**SIM.**
==37==Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you,
==38==Ay, so well, that you must be her master,
==39==And she will be your scholar; therefore look to it.

**PER.**
==40==I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.

**SIM.**
==41==She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.

**PER.**
*(Aside.)*
==42==What’s here?
==43==A letter that she loves the knight of Tyre!
==44==’Tis the King’s subtlety to have my life.⁠—
==45==O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
==46==A stranger and distressed gentleman,
==47==That never aim’d so high to love your daughter,
==48==But bent all offices to honor her.

**SIM.**
==49==Thou hast bewitch’d my daughter, and thou art
==50==A villain.

**PER.**
==51==By the gods, I have not.
==52==Never did thought of mine levy offense;
==53==Nor never did my actions yet commence
==54==A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.

**SIM.**
==55==Traitor, thou liest.

**PER.**
==55==           Traitor?

**SIM.**
==55==                Ay, traitor.

**PER.**
==56==Even in his throat—unless it be the King⁠—
==57==That calls me traitor, I return the lie.

**SIM.**
*(Aside.)*
==58==Now by the gods, I do applaud his courage.

**PER.**
==59==My actions are as noble as my thoughts,
==60==That never relish’d of a base descent.
==61==I came unto your court for honor’s cause,
==62==And not to be a rebel to her state;
==63==And he that otherwise accounts of me,
==64==This sword shall prove he’s honor’s enemy.

**SIM.**
==65==No?
==66==Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.

*Enter Thaisa.*

**PER.**
==67==Then as you are as virtuous as fair,
==68==Resolve your angry father if my tongue
==69==Did e’er solicit, or my hand subscribe
==70==To any syllable that made love to you.

**THAI.**
==71==Why, sir, say if you had, who takes offense
==72==At that would make me glad?

**SIM.**
==73==Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
*(Aside.)*
==74==I am glad on’t with all my heart.⁠—
==75==I’ll tame you; I’ll bring you in subjection.
==76==Will you, not having my consent,
==77==Bestow your love and your affections
==78==Upon a stranger?
*(Aside.)*
==78==           who, for aught I know,
==79==May be (nor can I think the contrary) 
==80==As great in blood as I myself.⁠—
==81==Therefore hear you, mistress, either frame
==82==Your will to mine—and you, sir, hear you⁠—
==83==Either be rul’d by me, or I’ll make you⁠—
==84==Man and wife.
==85==Nay come, your hands and lips must seal it too;
==86==And being join’d, I’ll thus your hopes destroy,
==87==And for further grief—God give you joy!
==88==What, are you both pleased?

**THAI.**
==88==                Yes, if you love me, sir.

**PER.**
==89==Even as my life my blood that fosters it.

**SIM.**
==90==What, are you both agreed?

**BOTH THAI., PER.**
==91==Yes, if’t please your Majesty.

**SIM.**
==92==It pleaseth me so well that I will see you wed,
==93==And then with what haste you can, get you to bed.

*Exeunt.*
