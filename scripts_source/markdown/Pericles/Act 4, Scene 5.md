[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 6|Act 4, Scene 6 →]]

*Mytilene. A street before the brothel.*

*Enter two Gentlemen of Myteline.*

**1. GENT. MYT.**
==1== Did you ever hear the like?

**2. GENT. MYT.**
==2== No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she being once gone.

**1. GENT. MYT.**
==3== But to have divinity preach’d there! Did you ever dream of such a thing?

**2. GENT. MYT.**
==4== No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses. Shall ’s go hear the vestals sing?

**1. GENT. MYT.**
==5== I’ll do any thing now that is virtuous, but I am out of the road of rutting forever.

*Exeunt.*
