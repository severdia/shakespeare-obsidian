## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Prologue|Act 4, Prologue →]]

*Ephesus. A room in Cerimon’s house.*

*Enter Cerimon and Thaisa.*

**CER.**
Madam, this letter and some certain jewels
Lay with you in your coffer, which are
At your command. Know you the character?

**THAI.**
It is my lord’s.
That I was shipp’d at sea I well remember,
Even on my eaning time, but whether there
Delivered, by the holy gods
I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
My wedded lord, I ne’er shall see again,
A vestal livery will I take me to,
And never more have joy.

**CER.**
Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
Diana’s temple is not distant far,
Where you may abide till your date expire.
Moreover if you please a niece of mine
Shall there attend you.

**THAI.**
My recompense is thanks, that’s all,
Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.

*Exeunt.*
