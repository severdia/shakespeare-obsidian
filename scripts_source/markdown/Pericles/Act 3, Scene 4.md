## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Prologue|Act 4, Prologue →]]

*Ephesus. A room in Cerimon’s house.*

*Enter Cerimon and Thaisa.*

**CER.**
==1== Madam, this letter and some certain jewels
==2== Lay with you in your coffer, which are
==3== At your command. Know you the character?

**THAI.**
==4== It is my lord’s.
==5== That I was shipp’d at sea I well remember,
==6== Even on my eaning time, but whether there
==7== Delivered, by the holy gods
==8== I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
==9== My wedded lord, I ne’er shall see again,
==10== A vestal livery will I take me to,
==11== And never more have joy.

**CER.**
==12== Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
==13== Diana’s temple is not distant far,
==14== Where you may abide till your date expire.
==15== Moreover if you please a niece of mine
==16== Shall there attend you.

**THAI.**
==17== My recompense is thanks, that’s all,
==18== Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.

*Exeunt.*
