## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Tarsus. A room in Cleon’s house.*

*Enter Pericles at Tharsus with Cleon and Dionyza and Lychorida with Marina in her arms.*

**PER.**
==1== Most honor’d Cleon, I must needs be gone.
==2== My twelve months are expir’d, and Tyrus stands
==3== In a litigious peace. You and your lady
==4== Take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods
==5== Make up the rest upon you!

**CLE.**
==6== Your shakes of fortune, though they haunt you mortally,
==7== Yet glance full wond’ringly on us.

**DION.**
==7==                   O your sweet queen!
==8== That the strict fates had pleas’d you had brought her hither
==9== To have blest mine eyes with her!

**PER.**
==9==                   We cannot but obey
==10== The powers above us. Could I rage and roar
==11== As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end
==12== Must be as ’tis. My gentle babe Marina, whom,
==13== For she was born at sea, I have nam’d so, here
==14== I charge your charity withal; leaving her
==15== The infant of your care, beseeching you
==16== To give her princely training, that she may be
==17== Manner’d as she is born.

**CLE.**
==17==               Fear not, my lord, but think
==18== Your Grace, that fed my country with your corn,
==19== For which the people’s prayers still fall upon you,
==20== Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
==21== Should therein make me vile, the common body,
==22== By you reliev’d, would force me to my duty;
==23== But if to that my nature need a spur,
==24== The gods revenge it upon me and mine
==25== To the end of generation!

**PER.**
==25==               I believe you,
==26== Your honor and your goodness teach me to’t
==27== Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,
==28== By bright Diana, whom we honor, all
==29== Unscissor’d shall this hair of mine remain,
==30== Though I show ill in’t. So I take my leave.
==31== Good madam, make me blessed in your care
==32== In bringing up my child.

**DION.**
==32==               I have one myself,
==33== Who shall not be more dear to my respect
==34== Than yours, my lord.

**PER.**
==34==            Madam, my thanks and prayers.

**CLE.**
==35== We’ll bring your Grace e’en to the edge a’ th’ shore,
==36== Then give you up to the mask’d Neptune and
==37== The gentlest winds of heaven.

**PER.**
==37==                   I will embrace
==38== Your offer. Come, dearest madam. O, no tears,
==39== Lychorida, no tears.
==40== Look to your little mistress, on whose grace
==41== You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.

*Exeunt.*
