## Act 1, Prologue
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 1|Act 1, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Gower.*

**GOW.**
==1==To sing a song that old was sung,
==2==From ashes ancient Gower is come,
==3==Assuming man’s infirmities,
==4==To glad your ear and please your eyes.
==5==It hath been sung at festivals,
==6==On ember-eves and holy-ales;
==7==And lords and ladies in their lives
==8==Have read it for restoratives.
==9==The purchase is to make men glorious,
==10==*Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius*.
==11==If you, born in those latter times,
==12==When wit’s more ripe, accept my rhymes,
==13==And that to hear an old man sing
==14==May to your wishes pleasure bring,
==15==I life would wish, and that I might
==16==Waste it for you like taper-light.
==17==This’ Antioch, then; Antiochus the Great
==18==Built up this city for his chiefest seat,
==19==The fairest in all Syria⁠—
==20==I tell you what mine authors say.
==21==This king unto him took a peer,
==22==Who died and left a female heir,
==23==So buxom, blithe, and full of face
==24==As heaven had lent her all his grace;
==25==With whom the father liking took,
==26==And her to incest did provoke⁠—
==27==Bad child, worse father, to entice his own
==28==To evil should be done by none.
==29==But custom what they did begin
==30==Was with long use account’d no sin.
==31==The beauty of this sinful dame
==32==Made many princes thither frame
==33==To seek her as a bedfellow,
==34==In marriage pleasures playfellow;
==35==Which to prevent he made a law,
==36==To keep her still and men in awe,
==37==That whoso ask’d her for his wife,
==38==His riddle told not, lost his life.
==39==So for her many a wight did die,
==40==As yon grim looks do testify.
*(Points to the heads of the unsuccessful suitors, displayed above.)*
==41==What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
==42==I give my cause, who best can justify.


*Exit.*
