## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Tarsus. A room in Cleon’s house.*

*Enter Cleon and Dionyza.*

**DION.**
==1==Why are you foolish? Can it be undone?

**CLE.**
==2==O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
==3==The sun and moon ne’er look’d upon!

**DION.**
==4==I think you’ll turn a child again.

**CLE.**
==5==Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
==6==I’d give it to undo the deed. O lady,
==7==Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
==8==To equal any single crown a’ th’ earth
==9==I’ th’ justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
==10==Whom thou hast pois’ned too.
==11==If thou hadst drunk to him, ’t ’ad been a kindness
==12==Becoming well thy fact. What canst thou say
==13==When noble Pericles shall demand his child?

**DION.**
==14==That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
==15==To foster it, not ever to preserve.
==16==She died at night; I’ll say so. Who can cross it?
==17==Unless you play the pious innocent,
==18==And for an honest attribute cry out,
==19==“She died by foul play.”

**CLE.**
==19==              O, go to. Well, well,
==20==Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
==21==Do like this worst.

**DION.**
==21==           Be one of those that thinks
==22==The petty wrens of Tharsus will fly hence
==23==And open this to Pericles. I do shame
==24==To think of what a noble strain you are,
==25==And of how coward a spirit.

**CLE.**
==25==              To such proceeding
==26==Who ever but his approbation added,
==27==Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
==28==From honorable courses.

**DION.**
==28==              Be it so then,
==29==Yet none does know but you how she came dead,
==30==Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
==31==She did distain my child, and stood between
==32==Her and her fortunes. None would look on her,
==33==But cast their gazes on Marina’s face;
==34==Whilest ours was blurted at and held a mawkin
==35==Not worth the time of day. It pierc’d me thorough,
==36==And though you call my course unnatural,
==37==You not your child well loving, yet I find
==38==It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
==39==Perform’d to your sole daughter.

**CLE.**
==39==                  Heavens forgive it!

**DION.**
==40==And as for Pericles,
==41==What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
==42==And yet we mourn. Her monument
==43==Is almost finished, and her epitaphs
==44==In glitt’ring golden characters express
==45==A general praise to her, and care in us
==46==At whose expense ’tis done.

**CLE.**
==46==              Thou art like the harpy,
==47==Which to betray, dost with thine angel’s face
==48==Seize with thine eagle’s talents.

**DION.**
==49==Y’ are like one that superstitiously
==50==Do swear to th’ gods that winter kills the flies,
==51==But yet I know you’ll do as I advise.

*Exeunt.*
