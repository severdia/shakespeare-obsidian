## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Tyre. A room in the palace.*

*Enter Pericles with his Lords.*

**PER.**
Let none disturb us.
*(Exeunt Lords.)*
           Why should this change of thoughts,
The sad companion, dull-ey’d melancholy,
Be my so us’d a guest as not an hour
In the day’s glorious walk or peaceful night,
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
And danger, which I fear’d, is at Antioch,
Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here.
Yet neither pleasure’s art can joy my spirits,
Nor yet the other’s distance comfort me.
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
That have their first conception by misdread,
Have after-nourishment and life by care;
And what was first but fear what might be done,
Grows elder now, and cares it be not done.
And so with me: the great Antiochus,
’Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
Since he’s so great can make his will his act,
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
Nor boots it me to say I honor him,
If he suspect I may dishonor him;
And what may make him blush in being known,
He’ll stop the course by which it might be known.
With hostile forces he’ll o’erspread the land,
And with th’ ostent of war will look so huge,
Amazement shall drive courage from the state,
Our men be vanquish’d ere they do resist,
And subjects punish’d that ne’er thought offense:
Which care of them, not pity of myself⁠—
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them⁠—
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
And punish that before that he would punish.

*Enter Helicanus and all the Lords to Pericles.*

**1. LORD. TYRE.**
Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!

**2. LORD. TYRE.**
And keep your mind, till you return to us,
Peaceful and comfortable!

**HEL.**
Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
They do abuse the King that flatter him,
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin,
The thing the which is flattered, but a spark
To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
Fits kings as they are men, for they may err.
When *Signior* Sooth here does proclaim peace,
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please,
I cannot be much lower than my knees.

*Kneels.*

**PER.**
All leave us else; but let your cares o’erlook
What shipping and what lading’s in our haven,
And then return to us.
*(Exeunt Lords.)*
              Helicanus, thou
Hast mov’d us. What seest thou in our looks?

**HEL.**
An angry brow, dread lord.

**PER.**
If there be such a dart in princes’ frowns,
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?

**HEL.**
How dares the plants look up to heaven, from whence
They have their nourishment?

**PER.**
                Thou knowest I have power
To take thy life from thee.

**HEL.**
I have ground the axe myself,
Do but you strike the blow.

**PER.**
Rise, prithee rise. Sit down. Thou art
No flatterer. I thank thee for’t, and heaven forbid
That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid!
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
Who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant,
What wouldst thou have me do?

**HEL.**
                  To bear with patience
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.

**PER.**
Thou speak’st like a physician, Helicanus,
That ministers a potion unto me
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
Attend me then: I went to Antioch,
Where, as thou know’st, against the face of death
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,
From whence an issue I might propagate,
Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
The rest (hark in thine ear) as black as incest,
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
Seem’d not to strike, but smooth. But thou know’st this,
’Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss.
Which fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
Under the covering of a careful night,
Who seem’d my good protector, and being here,
Bethought what was past, what might succeed.
I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants’ fears
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years;
And should he doubt ’t, as no doubt he doth,
That I should open to the list’ning air
How many worthy princes’ bloods were shed
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
To lop that doubt, he’ll fill this land with arms,
And make pretense of wrong that I have done him;
When all, for mine, if I may call offense,
Must feel war’s blow, who spares not innocence:
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
Who now reprov’dst me for’t⁠—

**HEL.**
                  Alas, sir!

**PER.**
Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
How I might stop this tempest ere it came,
And finding little comfort to relieve them,
I thought it princely charity to grieve for them.

**HEL.**
Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
Who either by public war or private treason
Will take away your life.
Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
Your rule direct to any; if to me,
Day serves not light more faithful than I’ll be.

**PER.**
I do not doubt thy faith;
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?

**HEL.**
We’ll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
From whence we had our being and our birth.

**PER.**
Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tharsus
Intend my travel, where I’ll hear from thee,
And by whose letters I’ll dispose myself.
The care I had and have of subjects’ good
On thee I lay, whose wisdom’s strength can bear it.
I’ll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:
Who shuns not to break one will crack them both;
But in our orbs we’ll live so round and safe,
That time of both this truth shall ne’er convince,
Thou show’dst a subject’s shine, I a true prince’.

*Exeunt.*
