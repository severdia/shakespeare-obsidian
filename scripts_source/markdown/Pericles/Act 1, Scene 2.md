## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Tyre. A room in the palace.*

*Enter Pericles with his Lords.*

**PER.**
==1== Let none disturb us.
*(Exeunt Lords.)*
==1==            Why should this change of thoughts,
==2== The sad companion, dull-ey’d melancholy,
==3== Be my so us’d a guest as not an hour
==4== In the day’s glorious walk or peaceful night,
==5== The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
==6== Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
==7== And danger, which I fear’d, is at Antioch,
==8== Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here.
==9== Yet neither pleasure’s art can joy my spirits,
==10== Nor yet the other’s distance comfort me.
==11== Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
==12== That have their first conception by misdread,
==13== Have after-nourishment and life by care;
==14== And what was first but fear what might be done,
==15== Grows elder now, and cares it be not done.
==16== And so with me: the great Antiochus,
==17== ’Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
==18== Since he’s so great can make his will his act,
==19== Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
==20== Nor boots it me to say I honor him,
==21== If he suspect I may dishonor him;
==22== And what may make him blush in being known,
==23== He’ll stop the course by which it might be known.
==24== With hostile forces he’ll o’erspread the land,
==25== And with th’ ostent of war will look so huge,
==26== Amazement shall drive courage from the state,
==27== Our men be vanquish’d ere they do resist,
==28== And subjects punish’d that ne’er thought offense:
==29== Which care of them, not pity of myself⁠—
==30== Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
==31== Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them⁠—
==32== Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
==33== And punish that before that he would punish.

*Enter Helicanus and all the Lords to Pericles.*

**1. LORD. TYRE.**
==34== Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!

**2. LORD. TYRE.**
==35== And keep your mind, till you return to us,
==36== Peaceful and comfortable!

**HEL.**
==37== Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
==38== They do abuse the King that flatter him,
==39== For flattery is the bellows blows up sin,
==40== The thing the which is flattered, but a spark
==41== To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
==42== Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
==43== Fits kings as they are men, for they may err.
==44== When *Signior* Sooth here does proclaim peace,
==45== He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
==46== Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please,
==47== I cannot be much lower than my knees.

*Kneels.*

**PER.**
==48== All leave us else; but let your cares o’erlook
==49== What shipping and what lading’s in our haven,
==50== And then return to us.
*(Exeunt Lords.)*
==50==               Helicanus, thou
==51== Hast mov’d us. What seest thou in our looks?

**HEL.**
==52== An angry brow, dread lord.

**PER.**
==53== If there be such a dart in princes’ frowns,
==54== How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?

**HEL.**
==55== How dares the plants look up to heaven, from whence
==56== They have their nourishment?

**PER.**
==56==                 Thou knowest I have power
==57== To take thy life from thee.

**HEL.**
==58== I have ground the axe myself,
==59== Do but you strike the blow.

**PER.**
==60== Rise, prithee rise. Sit down. Thou art
==61== No flatterer. I thank thee for’t, and heaven forbid
==62== That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid!
==63== Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
==64== Who by thy wisdom makes a prince thy servant,
==65== What wouldst thou have me do?

**HEL.**
==65==                   To bear with patience
==66== Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.

**PER.**
==67== Thou speak’st like a physician, Helicanus,
==68== That ministers a potion unto me
==69== That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
==70== Attend me then: I went to Antioch,
==71== Where, as thou know’st, against the face of death
==72== I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty,
==73== From whence an issue I might propagate,
==74== Are arms to princes and bring joys to subjects.
==75== Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
==76== The rest (hark in thine ear) as black as incest,
==77== Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
==78== Seem’d not to strike, but smooth. But thou know’st this,
==79== ’Tis time to fear when tyrants seems to kiss.
==80== Which fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
==81== Under the covering of a careful night,
==82== Who seem’d my good protector, and being here,
==83== Bethought what was past, what might succeed.
==84== I knew him tyrannous, and tyrants’ fears
==85== Decrease not, but grow faster than the years;
==86== And should he doubt ’t, as no doubt he doth,
==87== That I should open to the list’ning air
==88== How many worthy princes’ bloods were shed
==89== To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
==90== To lop that doubt, he’ll fill this land with arms,
==91== And make pretense of wrong that I have done him;
==92== When all, for mine, if I may call offense,
==93== Must feel war’s blow, who spares not innocence:
==94== Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
==95== Who now reprov’dst me for’t⁠—

**HEL.**
==95==                   Alas, sir!

**PER.**
==96== Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
==97== Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
==98== How I might stop this tempest ere it came,
==99== And finding little comfort to relieve them,
==100== I thought it princely charity to grieve for them.

**HEL.**
==101== Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak,
==102== Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
==103== And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
==104== Who either by public war or private treason
==105== Will take away your life.
==106== Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
==107== Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
==108== Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
==109== Your rule direct to any; if to me,
==110== Day serves not light more faithful than I’ll be.

**PER.**
==111== I do not doubt thy faith;
==112== But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?

**HEL.**
==113== We’ll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
==114== From whence we had our being and our birth.

**PER.**
==115== Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tharsus
==116== Intend my travel, where I’ll hear from thee,
==117== And by whose letters I’ll dispose myself.
==118== The care I had and have of subjects’ good
==119== On thee I lay, whose wisdom’s strength can bear it.
==120== I’ll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:
==121== Who shuns not to break one will crack them both;
==122== But in our orbs we’ll live so round and safe,
==123== That time of both this truth shall ne’er convince,
==124== Thou show’dst a subject’s shine, I a true prince’.

*Exeunt.*
