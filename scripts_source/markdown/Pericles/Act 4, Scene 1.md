## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Prologue|← Act 4, Prologue]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Tarsus. An open place near the seashore.*

*Enter Dionyza with Leonine.*

**DION.**
==1==Thy oath remember, thou hast sworn to do’t.
==2==’Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
==3==Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon
==4==To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
==5==Which is but cold in flaming, thy lone bosom
==6==Inflame too nicely, nor let pity, which
==7==Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
==8==A soldier to thy purpose.

**LEON.**
==9==I will do’t, but yet she is a goodly creature.

**DION.**
==10==The fitter then the gods should have her.
==11==Here she comes weeping for her only mistress’ death.
==12==Thou art resolv’d?

**LEON.**
==12==           I am resolv’d.

*Enter Marina with a basket of flowers.*

**MAR.**
==13==No; I will rob Tellus of her weed
==14==To strow thy green with flowers. The yellows, blues,
==15==The purple violets, and marigolds,
==16==Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave
==17==While summer days doth last. Ay me! Poor maid,
==18==Born in a tempest when my mother died,
==19==This world to me is a lasting storm,
==20==Whirring me from my friends.

**DION.**
==21==How now, Marina, why do you keep alone?
==22==How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
==23==Consume your blood with sorrowing; have you
==24==A nurse of me. Lord, how your favor’s chang’d
==25==With this unprofitable woe! Come
==26==Give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
==27==Walk with Leonine, the air is quick there,
==28==And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
==29==Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.

**MAR.**
==30==No, I pray you,
==31==I’ll not bereave you of your servant.

**DION.**
==31==                  Come, come,
==32==I love the King your father, and yourself,
==33==With more than foreign heart. We every day
==34==Expect him here: when he shall come and find
==35==Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
==36==He will repent the breadth of his great voyage,
==37==Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
==38==No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
==39==Walk, and be cheerful once again, reserve
==40==That excellent complexion, which did steal
==41==The eyes of young and old. Care not for me,
==42==I can go home alone.

**MAR.**
==42==           Well, I will go,
==43==But yet I have no desire to it.

**DION.**
==44==Come, come, I know ’tis good for you.
==45==Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least.
==46==Remember what I have said.

**LEON.**
==46==              I warrant you, madam.

**DION.**
==47==I’ll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while.
==48==Pray walk softly, do not heat your blood.
==49==What, I must have care of you.

**MAR.**
==49==                  My thanks, sweet madam.
*(Exit Dionyza.)*
==50==Is this wind westerly that blows?

**LEON.**
==50==                  South-west.

**MAR.**
==51==When I was born, the wind was north.

**LEON.**
==51==                     Was’t so?

**MAR.**
==52==My father, as nurse says, did never fear,
==53==But cried “Good seamen!” to the sailors, galling
==54==His kingly hands haling ropes,
==55==And clasping to the mast, endur’d a sea
==56==That almost burst the deck.

**LEON.**
==57==When was this?

**MAR.**
==58==When I was born.
==59==Never was waves nor wind more violent,
==60==And from the ladder-tackle washes off
==61==A canvas-climber. “Ha!” says one, “wolt out?”
==62==And with a dropping industry they skip
==63==From stem to stern. The boatswain whistles, and
==64==The master calls, and trebles their confusion.

**LEON.**
==65==Come say your prayers.

**MAR.**
==66==What mean you?

**LEON.**
==67==If you require a little space for prayer,
==68==I grant it. Pray, but be not tedious, for
==69==The gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
==70==To do my work with haste.

**MAR.**
==70==              Why will you kill me?

**LEON.**
==71==To satisfy my lady.

**MAR.**
==72==Why would she have me kill’d now?
==73==As I can remember, by my troth,
==74==I never did her hurt in all my life.
==75==I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
==76==To any living creature. Believe me law,
==77==I never kill’d a mouse, nor hurt a fly;
==78==I trod upon a worm against my will,
==79==But I wept for’t. How have I offended,
==80==Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
==81==Or my life imply her any danger?

**LEON.**
==82==My commission
==83==Is not to reason of the deed, but do’t.

**MAR.**
==84==You will not do’t for all the world, I hope.
==85==You are well-favored, and your looks foreshow
==86==You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately
==87==When you caught hurt in parting two that fought;
==88==Good sooth, it show’d well in you. Do so now.
==89==Your lady seeks my life, come you between,
==90==And save poor me, the weaker.

**LEON.**
==90==                I am sworn,
==91==And will dispatch.

*Enter Pirates.*

**1. PIRATE.**
==92==Hold, villain!

*Leonine runs away.*

**2. PIRATE.**
==93==A prize, a prize!

**3. PIRATE.**
==94==Half-part, mates, half-part. Come, let’s have her aboard suddenly.

*Exit Marina dragged out by the Pirates.*

*Enter Leonine.*

**LEON.**
==95==These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes,
==96==And they have seiz’d Marina. Let her go!
==97==There’s no hope she will return. I’ll swear she’s dead,
==98==And thrown into the sea. But I’ll see further:
==99==Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
==100==Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
==101==Whom they have ravish’d must by me be slain.

*Exit.*
