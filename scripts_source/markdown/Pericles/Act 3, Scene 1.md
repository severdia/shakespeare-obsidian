## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Prologue|← Act 3, Prologue]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*On a ship at sea.*

*Enter Pericles a-shipboard.*

**PER.**
==1==The god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,
==2==Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou that hast
==3==Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
==4==Having call’d them from the deep! O, still
==5==Thy deaf’ning, dreadful thunders, gently quench
==6==Thy nimble, sulfurous flashes!—O, how, Lychorida!
==7==How does my queen?—Thou storm, venomously
==8==Wilt thou spet all thyself? The seaman’s whistle
==9==Is as a whisper in the ears of death,
==10==Unheard.—Lychorida!—Lucina, O!
==11==Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle
==12==To those that cry by night, convey thy Deity
==13==Aboard our dancing boat, make swift the pangs
==14==Of my queen’s travails!—Now, Lychorida!

*Enter Lychorida with an infant.*

**LYC.**
==15==Here is a thing too young for such a place,
==16==Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I
==17==Am like to do. Take in your arms this piece
==18==Of your dead queen.

**PER.**
==18==           How? How, Lychorida?

**LYC.**
==19==Patience, good sir, do not assist the storm.
==20==Here’s all that is left living of your queen:
==21==A little daughter. For the sake of it
==22==Be manly, and take comfort.

**PER.**
==22==                O you gods!
==23==Why do you make us love your goodly gifts
==24==And snatch them straight away? We here below
==25==Recall not what we give, and therein may
==26==Use honor with you.

**LYC.**
==26==           Patience, good sir,
==27==Even for this charge.

**PER.**
==27==           Now, mild may be thy life!
==28==For a more blusterous birth had never babe.
==29==Quiet and gentle thy conditions! For
==30==Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
==31==That ever was prince’s child. Happy what follows!
==32==Thou hast as chiding a nativity
==33==As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make
==34==To herald thee from the womb. Even at the first
==35==Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit
==36==With all thou canst find here. Now the good gods
==37==Throw their best eyes upon’t!

*Enter two Sailors.*

**1. SAIL.**
==38==What courage, sir? God save you!

**PER.**
==39==Courage enough. I do not fear the flaw,
==40==It hath done to me the worst. Yet for the love
==41==Of this poor infant, this fresh new sea-farer,
==42==I would it would be quiet.

**1. SAIL.**
==43==Slack the bolins there!—Thou wilt not, wilt thou? Blow, and split thyself.

**2. SAIL.**
==44==But sea-room, and the brine and cloudy billow kiss the moon, I care not.

**1. SAIL.**
==45==Sir, your queen must overboard. The sea works high, the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be clear’d of the dead.

**PER.**
==46==That’s your superstition.

**1. SAIL.**
==47==Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still observ’d, and we are strong in custom; therefore briefly yield ’er, for she must overboard straight.

**PER.**
==48==As you think meet. Most wretched queen!

**LYC.**
==49==Here she lies, sir.

**PER.**
==50==A terrible child-bed hast thou had, my dear,
==51==No light, no fire. Th’ unfriendly elements
==52==Forgot thee utterly, nor have I time
==53==To give thee hallow’d to thy grave, but straight
==54==Must cast thee, scarcely coffin’d, in the ooze,
==55==Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
==56==The e’er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
==57==And humming water must o’erwhelm thy corpse,
==58==Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,
==59==Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
==60==My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
==61==Bring me the satin coffin. Lay the babe
==62==Upon the pillow. Hie thee, whiles I say
==63==A priestly farewell to her. Suddenly, woman.

*Exit Lychorida.*

**2. SAIL.**
==64==Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulk’d and bitum’d ready.

**PER.**
==65==I thank thee. Mariner, say, what coast is this?

**2. SAIL.**
==66==We are near Tharsus.

**PER.**
==67==Thither, gentle mariner,
==68==Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?

**1. SAIL.**
==69==By break of day, if the wind cease.

**PER.**
==70==O, make for Tharsus!
==71==There will I visit Cleon, for the babe
==72==Cannot hold out to Tyrus. There I’ll leave it
==73==At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner,
==74==I’ll bring the body presently.

*Exeunt.*
