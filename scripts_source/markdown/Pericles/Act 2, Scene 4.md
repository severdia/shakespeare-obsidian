## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Tyre. A room in the Governor’s house.*

*Enter Helicanus and Escanes.*

**HEL.**
==1==No, Escanes, know this of me,
==2==Antiochus from incest lived not free;
==3==For which, the most high gods not minding longer
==4==To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
==5==Due to this heinous capital offense,
==6==Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
==7==When he was seated in a chariot
==8==Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
==9==A fire from heaven came and shrivell’d up
==10==Those bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,
==11==That all those eyes ador’d them ere their fall
==12==Scorn now their hand should give them burial.

**ESCA.**
==13==’Twas very strange.

**HEL.**
==13==           And yet but justice; for though
==14==This king were great, his greatness was no guard
==15==To bar heaven’s shaft, but sin had his reward.

**ESCA.**
==16==’Tis very true.

*Enter two or three Lords of Tyre.*

**1. LORD. TYRE.**
==17==See, not a man in private conference
==18==Or council has respect with him but he.

**2. LORD. TYRE.**
==19==It shall no longer grieve without reproof.

**3. LORD. TYRE.**
==20==And curs’d be he that will not second it.

**1. LORD. TYRE.**
==21==Follow me then. Lord Helicane, a word.

**HEL.**
==22==With me? And welcome. Happy day, my lords.

**1. LORD. TYRE.**
==23==Know that our griefs are risen to the top,
==24==And now at length they overflow their banks.

**HEL.**
==25==Your griefs, for what? Wrong not your prince you love.

**1. LORD. TYRE.**
==26==Wrong not yourself then, noble Helicane;
==27==But if the Prince do live, let us salute him,
==28==Or know what ground’s made happy by his breath.
==29==If in the world he live, we’ll seek him out;
==30==If in his grave he rest, we’ll find him there;
==31==And be resolved he lives to govern us,
==32==Or dead, give ’s cause to mourn his funeral,
==33==And leave us to our free election.

**2. LORD. TYRE.**
==34==Whose death indeed the strongest in our censure,
==35==And knowing this kingdom is without a head⁠—
==36==Like goodly buildings left without a roof
==37==Soon fall to ruin—your noble self,
==38==That best know how to rule and how to reign,
==39==We thus submit unto—our sovereign.

**ALL. IN TYRE.**
==40==Live, noble Helicane!

**HEL.**
==41==Try honor’s cause; forbear your suffrages.
==42==If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
==43==Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
==44==Where’s hourly trouble for a minute’s ease.
==45==A twelvemonth longer let me entreat you
==46==To forbear the absence of your king;
==47==If in which time expir’d he not return,
==48==I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
==49==But if I cannot win you to this love,
==50==Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
==51==And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
==52==Whom if you find, and win unto return,
==53==You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.

**1. LORD. TYRE.**
==54==To wisdom he’s a fool that will not yield;
==55==And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,
==56==We with our travels will endeavor.

**HEL.**
==57==Then you love us, we you, and we’ll clasp hands:
==58==When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.

*Exeunt.*
