## Act 2, Prologue
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Gower.*

**GOW.**
==1==Here have you seen a mighty king
==2==His child, I wis, to incest bring;
==3==A better prince and benign lord,
==4==That will prove awful both in deed and word.
==5==Be quiet then, as men should be,
==6==Till he hath pass’d necessity.
==7==I’ll show you those in troubles reign,
==8==Losing a mite, a mountain gain.
==9==The good in conversation,
==10==To whom I give my benison,
==11==Is still at Tharsus, where each man
==12==Thinks all is writ he speken can;
==13==And, to remember what he does,
==14==Build his statue to make him glorious.
==15==But tidings to the contrary
==16==Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?
*(Dumb Show.)*
*(Enter at one door Pericles talking with Cleon; all the Train with them. Enter at another door the First Tyrian Messenger with a letter to Pericles. Pericles shows the letter to Cleon. Pericles gives the Messenger a reward and knights him. Exit Pericles at one door and Cleon at another.)*
==17==Good Helicane, that stay’d at home,
==18==Not to eat honey like a drone
==19==From others’ labors; for though he strive
==20==To killen bad, keep good alive,
==21==And to fulfill his prince’ desire,
==22==Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:
==23==How Thaliard came full bent with sin
==24==And hid intent to murder him;
==25==And that in Tharsus was not best
==26==Longer for him to make his rest.
==27==He, doing so, put forth to seas,
==28==Where when men been, there’s seldom ease,
==29==For now the wind begins to blow;
==30==Thunder above, and deeps below,
==31==Makes such unquiet, that the ship
==32==Should house him safe is wrack’d and split,
==33==And he, good prince, having all lost,
==34==By waves from coast to coast is toss’d.
==35==All perishen of man, of pelf,
==36==Ne aught escapend but himself;
==37==Till Fortune, tir’d with doing bad,
==38==Threw him ashore, to give him glad.
==39==And here he comes. What shall be next,
==40==Pardon old Gower—this long’s the text.


*Exit.*
