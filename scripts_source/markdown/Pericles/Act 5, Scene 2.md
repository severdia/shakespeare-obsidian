## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*Ephesus. Before the temple of Diana.*

*The Temple of Diana at Ephesus; Thaisa standing near the altar, as high priestess; a number of Virgins on each side; Cerimon and other inhabitants of Ephesus attending.*

*Enter Gower.*

**GOW.**
==1== Now our sands are almost run,
==2== More a little, and then dumb.
==3== This, my last boon, give me,
==4== For such kindness must relieve me:
==5== That you aptly will suppose
==6== What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
==7== What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
==8== The regent made in Mytilene,
==9== To greet the King. So he thrived
==10== That he is promis’d to be wived
==11== To fair Marina, but in no wise
==12== Till he had done his sacrifice,
==13== As Dian bade; whereto being bound,
==14== The interim, pray you, all confound.
==15== In feather’d briefness sails are fill’d,
==16== And wishes fall out as they’re will’d.
==17== At Ephesus the temple see,
==18== Our King and all his company.
==19== That he can hither come so soon
==20== Is by your fancies’ thankful doom.

*Exit.*
