## Act 4, Prologue
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Gower.*

**GOW.**
==1==Imagine Pericles arriv’d at Tyre,
==2==Welcom’d and settled to his own desire.
==3==His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
==4==Unto Diana there ’s a votaress.
==5==Now to Marina bend your mind,
==6==Whom our fast-growing scene must find
==7==At Tharsus, and by Cleon train’d
==8==In music’s letters, who hath gain’d
==9==Of education all the grace,
==10==Which makes her both th’ heart and place
==11==Of general wonder. But alack,
==12==That monster Envy, oft the wrack
==13==Of earned praise, Marina’s life
==14==Seeks to take off by treason’s knife,
==15==And in this kind: our Cleon hath
==16==One daughter, and a full-grown wench,
==17==Even ripe for marriage rite; this maid
==18==Hight Philoten, and it is said
==19==For certain in our story, she
==20==Would ever with Marina be:
==21==Be’t when they weav’d the sleided silk
==22==With fingers long, small, white as milk;
==23==Or when she would with sharp needle wound
==24==The cambric, which she made more sound
==25==By hurting it; or when to th’ lute
==26==She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
==27==That still records with moan; or when
==28==She would with rich and constant pen
==29==Vail to her mistress Dian; still
==30==This Philoten contends in skill
==31==With absolute Marina: so
==32==The dove of Paphos might with the crow
==33==Vie feathers white. Marina gets
==34==All praises, which are paid as debts,
==35==And not as given. This so darks
==36==In Philoten all graceful marks,
==37==That Cleon’s wife, with envy rare,
==38==A present murderer does prepare
==39==For good Marina, that her daughter
==40==Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
==41==The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
==42==Lychorida, our nurse, is dead,
==43==And cursed Dionyza hath
==44==The pregnant instrument of wrath
==45==Prest for this blow. The unborn event
==46==I do commend to your content;
==47==Only I carried winged time
==48==Post on the lame feet of my rhyme,
==49==Which never could I so convey,
==50==Unless your thoughts went on my way.
==51==Dionyza does appear,
==52==With Leonine, a murderer.


*Exit.*
