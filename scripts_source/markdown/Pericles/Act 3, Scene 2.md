## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Ephesus. A room in Cerimon’s house.*

*Enter Lord Cerimon with an Ephesan Servant and another Man, both storm-beaten.*

**CER.**
==1== Philemon, ho!

*Enter Philemon.*

**PHIL.**
==2== Doth my lord call?

**CER.**
==3== Get fire and meat for these poor men.
*(Exit Philemon.)*
==4== ’T ’as been a turbulent and stormy night.

**EPH. SERV.**
==5== I have been in many; but such a night as this
==6== Till now I ne’er endured.

**CER.**
==7== Your master will be dead ere you return,
==8== There’s nothing can be minist’red to nature
==9== That can recover him.
*(To the other Man.)*
==10== Give this to the pothecary,
==11== And tell me how it works.

*Exeunt Ephesan Servant and other Man.*

*Enter two Gentlemen.*

**1. GENT. EPH.**
==11==               Good morrow.

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==12== Good morrow to your lordship.

**CER.**
==12==                   Gentlemen,
==13== Why do you stir so early?

**1. GENT. EPH.**
==14== Sir,
==15== Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
==16== Shook as the earth did quake;
==17== The very principals did seem to rend,
==18== And all to topple. Pure surprise and fear
==19== Made me to quit the house.

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==20== That is the cause we trouble you so early,
==21== ’Tis not our husbandry.

**CER.**
==21==               O, you say well.

**1. GENT. EPH.**
==22== But I much marvel that your lordship, having
==23== Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
==24== Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
==25== ’Tis most strange
==26== Nature should be so conversant with pain,
==27== Being thereto not compelled.

**CER.**
==27==                 I hold it ever
==28== Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
==29== Than nobleness and riches. Careless heirs
==30== May the two latter darken and expend;
==31== But immortality attends the former,
==32== Making a man a god. ’Tis known, I ever
==33== Have studied physic; through which secret art,
==34== By turning o’er authorities, I have,
==35== Together with my practice, made familiar
==36== To me and to my aid the blest infusions
==37== That dwells in vegetives, in metals, stones;
==38== And can speak of the disturbances
==39== That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
==40== A more content in course of true delight
==41== Than to be thirsty after tottering honor,
==42== Or tie my pleasure up in silken bags,
==43== To please the fool and death.

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==44== Your honor has through Ephesus pour’d forth
==45== Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
==46== Your creatures, who by you have been restored;
==47== And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
==48== Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
==49== Such strong renown as time shall never⁠—

*Enter two or three of Cerimon’s Servants with a chest.*

**1. CER. SERV.**
==50== So, lift there.

**CER.**
==50==         What’s that?

**1. CER. SERV.**
==50==                 Sir, even now
==51== Did the sea toss up upon our shore this chest.
==52== ’Tis of some wrack.

**CER.**
==52==            Set’t down, let’s look upon’t.

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==53== ’Tis like a coffin, sir.

**CER.**
==53==            What e’er it be,
==54== ’Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight.
==55== If the sea’s stomach be o’ercharg’d with gold,
==56== ’Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==57== ’Tis so, my lord.

**CER.**
==57==         How close ’tis caulk’d and bitum’d!
==58== Did the sea cast it up?

**1. CER. SERV.**
==59== I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
==60== As toss’d it upon shore.

**CER.**
==60==               Wrench it open.
==61== Soft! It smells most sweetly in my sense.

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==62== A delicate odor.

**CER.**
==63== As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
==64== O you most potent gods! What’s here? A corse?

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==65== Most strange.

**CER.**
==66== Shrouded in cloth of state, balm’d and entreasur’d
==67== With full bags of spices! A passport too!
==68== Apollo, perfect me in the characters!
*(Reads from a scroll.)*
==69== *“Here I give to understand,*
==70== *If e’er this coffin drives a-land,*
==71== *I, King Pericles, have lost*
==72== *This queen, worth all our mundane cost.*
==73== *Who finds her, give her burying,*
==74== *She was the daughter of a king.*
==75== *Besides this treasure for a fee,*
==76== *The gods requite his charity!”*
==77== If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
==78== That ever cracks for woe! This chanc’d tonight.

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==79== Most likely, sir.

**CER.**
==79==            Nay, certainly tonight,
==80== For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
==81== That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within.
==82== Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.
*(Exit a Servant.)*
==83== Death may usurp on nature many hours,
==84== And yet the fire of life kindle again
==85== The o’erpress’d spirits. I heard of an Egyptian
==86== That had nine hours lien dead,
==87== Who was by good appliance recovered.
*(Enter one with boxes, napkins, and fire.)*
==88== Well said, well said. The fire and cloths.
==89== The rough and woeful music that we have,
==90== Cause it to sound, beseech you.
==91== The vial once more. How thou stir’st, thou block!
==92== The music there! I pray you give her air.
==93== Gentlemen, this queen will live. Nature awakes,
==94== A warmth breathes out of her. She hath not been
==95== Entranc’d above five hours. See how she gins
==96== To blow into life’s flower again!

**1. GENT. EPH.**
==96==                   The heavens,
==97== Through you, increase our wonder, and sets up
==98== Your fame forever.

**CER.**
==98==            She is alive; behold
==99== Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels
==100== Which Pericles hath lost, begin to part
==101== Their fringes of bright gold. The diamonds
==102== Of a most praised water doth appear,
==103== To make the world twice rich. Live, and make
==104== Us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
==105== Rare as you seem to be.

*She moves.*

**THAI.**
==105==               O dear Diana,
==106== Where am I? Where’s my lord? What world is this?

**2. GENT. EPH.**
==107== Is not this strange?

**1. GENT. EPH.**
==107==            Most rare.

**CER.**
==107==                 Hush, my gentle neighbors!
==108== Lend me your hands. To the next chamber bear her.
==109== Get linen. Now this matter must be look’d to,
==110== For her relapse is mortal. Come, come;
==111== And Aesculapius guide us!

*They carry her away. Exeunt omnes.*
