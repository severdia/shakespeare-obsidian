## Act 3, Prologue
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]


*Enter Gower.*

**GOW.**
==1==Now sleep yslacked hath the rout,
==2==No din but snores the house about,
==3==Made louder by the o’erfed breast
==4==Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
==5==The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
==6==Now couches from the mouse’s hole;
==7==And crickets sing at the oven’s mouth,
==8==Are the blither for their drouth.
==9==Hymen hath brought the bride to bed,
==10==Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
==11==A babe is molded. Be attent,
==12==And time that is so briefly spent
==13==With your fine fancies quaintly eche:
==14==What’s dumb in show I’ll plain with speech.
*(Dumb Show.)*
*(Enter Pericles and Simonides, at one door, with Attendants. The Second Tyrian Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives Pericles a letter. Pericles shows it Simonides; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter Thaisa with child, with Lychorida, a nurse. The King shows her the letter; she rejoices. She and Pericles take leave of her father, and depart with Lychorida and their Attendants. Then exeunt Simonides and the rest.)*
==15==By many a dern and painful perch,
==16==Of Pericles the careful search,
==17==By the four opposing coigns
==18==Which the world together joins,
==19==Is made with all due diligence
==20==That horse and sail and high expense
==21==Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
==22==Fame answering the most strange inquire,
==23==To th’ court of King Simonides
==24==Are letters brought, the tenor these:
==25==Antiochus and his daughter dead,
==26==The men of Tyrus on the head
==27==Of Helicanus would set on
==28==The crown of Tyre, but he will none.
==29==The mutiny he there hastes t’ oppress,
==30==Says to ’em, if King Pericles
==31==Come not home in twice six moons,
==32==He, obedient to their dooms,
==33==Will take the crown. The sum of this,
==34==Brought hither to Pentapolis,
==35==Yravished the regions round,
==36==And every one with claps can sound,
==37==“Our heir-apparent is a king!
==38==Who dreamt? Who thought of such a thing?”
==39==Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
==40==His queen, with child, makes her desire⁠—
==41==Which who shall cross?—along to go.
==42==Omit we all their dole and woe.
==43==Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
==44==And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
==45==On Neptune’s billow; half the flood
==46==Hath their keel cut. But fortune, mov’d,
==47==Varies again; the grisled north
==48==Disgorges such a tempest forth,
==49==That, as a duck for life that dives,
==50==So up and down the poor ship drives.
==51==The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
==52==Does fall in travail with her fear;
==53==And what ensues in this fell storm
==54==Shall for itself itself perform.
==55==I nill relate, action may
==56==Conveniently the rest convey,
==57==Which might not what by me is told.
==58==In your imagination hold
==59==This stage the ship, upon whose deck
==60==The seas-toss’d Pericles appears to speak.


*Exit.*
