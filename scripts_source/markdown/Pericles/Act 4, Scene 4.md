## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Tarsus. Before the tomb of Marina.*

*Enter Gower before the monument of Marina at Tharsus.*

**GOW.**
==1== Thus time we waste, and long leagues make short;
==2== Sail seas in cockles, have and wish but for’t,
==3== Making, to take our imagination,
==4== From bourn to bourn, region to region.
==5== By you being pardoned, we commit no crime
==6== To use one language in each several clime
==7== Where our scenes seems to live. I do beseech you
==8== To learn of me, who stand i’ th’ gaps to teach you,
==9== The stages of our story. Pericles
==10== Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
==11== Attended on by many a lord and knight,
==12== To see his daughter, all his live’s delight.
==13== Old Helicanus goes along. Behind
==14== Is left to govern it, you bear in mind,
==15== Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
==16== Advanc’d in time to great and high estate.
==17== Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
==18== This king to Tharsus—think his pilot thought,
==19== So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on⁠—
==20== To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
==21== Like motes and shadows see them move a while,
==22== Your ears unto your eyes I’ll reconcile.
*(Dumb Show.)*
*(Enter Pericles at one door with all his Train; Cleon and Dionyza at the other. Cleon shows Pericles the tomb; whereat Pericles makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt Cleon and Dionyza.)*
==23== See how belief may suffer by foul show!
==24== This borrowed passion stands for true old woe;
==25== And Pericles, in sorrow all devour’d,
==26== With sighs shot through and biggest tears o’ershow’r’d,
==27== Leaves Tharsus and again embarks. He swears
==28== Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs;
==29== He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
==30== A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
==31== And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit
==32== The epitaph is for Marina writ
==33== By wicked Dionyza.
*(Reads the inscription on Marina’s monument.)*
==34== *“The fairest, sweetest, and best lies here,*
==35== *Who withered in her spring of year.*
==36== *She was of Tyrus the King’s daughter,*
==37== *On whom foul death hath made this slaughter.*
==38== *Marina was she call’d, and at her birth,*
==39== *Thetis, being proud, swallowed some part a’ th’ earth.*
==40== *Therefore the earth, fearing to be o’erflowed,*
==41== *Hath Thetis’ birth-child on the heavens bestowed;*
==42== *Wherefore she does, and swears she’ll never stint,*
==43== *Make raging battery upon shores of flint.”*
==44== No visor does become black villainy
==45== So well as soft and tender flattery.
==46== Let Pericles believe his daughter’s dead,
==47== And bear his courses to be ordered
==48== By Lady Fortune, while our scene must play
==49== His daughter’s woe and heavy well-a-day
==50== In her unholy service. Patience then,
==51== And think you now are all in Mytilene.

*Exit.*
