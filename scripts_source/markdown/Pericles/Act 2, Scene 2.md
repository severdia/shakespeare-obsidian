## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Pentapolis. A public way, or platform leading to the lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the reception of the King, Princess, Lords, etc.*

*Enter Simonides, with attendance, Lords, and Thaisa.*

**SIM.**
==1== Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?

**1. LORD. PENT.**
==2== They are, my liege,
==3== And stay your coming to present themselves.

**SIM.**
==4== Return them, we are ready; and our daughter here,
==5== In honor of whose birth these triumphs are,
==6== Sits here like beauty’s child, whom nature gat
==7== For men to see, and seeing wonder at.

*Exit a Lord. Returns.*

**THAI.**
==8== It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
==9== My commendations great, whose merit’s less.

**SIM.**
==10== It’s fit it should be so, for princes are
==11== A model which heaven makes like to itself.
==12== As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
==13== So princes their renowns if not respected.
==14== ’Tis now your honor, daughter, to entertain
==15== The labor of each knight in his device.

**THAI.**
==16== Which, to preserve mine honor, I’ll perform.

*The First Knight passes by and his Page presents his shield to the Princess.*

**SIM.**
==17== Who is the first that doth prefer himself?

**THAI.**
==18== A knight of Sparta, my renowned father,
==19== And the device he bears upon his shield
==20== Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun;
==21== The word: “*Lux tua vita mihi*.”

**SIM.**
==22== He loves you well that holds his life of you.
*(The Second Knight passes by.)*
==23== Who is the second that presents himself?

**THAI.**
==24== A prince of Macedon, my royal father,
==25== And the device he bears upon his shield
==26== Is an armed knight that’s conquered by a lady;
==27== The motto thus, in Spanish: *“Piu per dolcera que per forsa.”*

*Third Knight passes by.*

**SIM.**
==28== And with the third?

**THAI.**
==28==            The third, of Antioch;
==29== And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
==30== The word: “*Me pompae provexit apex*.”

*Fourth Knight passes by.*

**SIM.**
==31== What is the fourth?

**THAL.**
==32== A burning torch that’s turned upside down;
==33== The word: “*Qui me alit, me extinguit*.”

**SIM.**
==34== Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
==35== Which can as well inflame as it can kill.

*Fifth Knight passes by.*

**THAI.**
==36== The fift, an hand environed with clouds,
==37== Holding out gold that’s by the touchstone tried;
==38== The motto thus: “*Sic spectanda fides*.”

*Sixth Knight, Pericles, as he passes by, himself presents his device to the Princess.*

**SIM.**
==39== And what’s
==40== The sixth and last, the which the knight himself
==41== With such a graceful courtesy delivered?

**THAI.**
==42== He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
==43== A withered branch, that’s only green at top;
==44== The motto: “*In hac spe vivo*.”

**SIM.**
==45== A pretty moral:
==46== From the dejected state wherein he is,
==47== He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.

**1. LORD. PENT.**
==48== He had need mean better than his outward show
==49== Can any way speak in his just commend;
==50== For by his rusty outside he appears
==51== To have practic’d more the whipstock than the lance.

**2. LORD. PENT.**
==52== He well may be a stranger, for he comes
==53== To an honor’d triumph strangely furnished.

**3. LORD. PENT.**
==54== And on set purpose let his armor rust
==55== Until this day, to scour it in the dust.

**SIM.**
==56== Opinion’s but a fool, that makes us scan
==57== The outward habit by the inward man.
==58== But stay, the knights are coming, we will withdraw
==59== Into the gallery.

*Exeunt.*

*Great shouts within, and all cry. “The mean knight!” *
