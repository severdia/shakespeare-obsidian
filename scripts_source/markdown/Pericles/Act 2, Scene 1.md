## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Prologue|← Act 2, Prologue]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Pentapolis. An open place by the seaside.*

*Enter Pericles wet.*

**PER.**
==1==Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
==2==Wind, rain, and thunder, remember earthly man
==3==Is but a substance that must yield to you;
==4==And I (as fits my nature) do obey you.
==5==Alas, the seas hath cast me on the rocks,
==6==Wash’d me from shore to shore, and left me breath
==7==Nothing to think on but ensuing death.
==8==Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
==9==To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;
==10==And having thrown him from your wat’ry grave,
==11==Here to have death in peace is all he’ll crave.

*Enter three Fishermen.*

**1. FISH.**
==12==What ho, Pilch!

**2. FISH.**
==13==Ha, come and bring away the nets!

**1. FISH.**
==14==What, Patch-breech, I say!

**3. FISH.**
==15==What say you, master?

**1. FISH.**
==16==Look how thou stir’st now! Come away, or I’ll fetch th’ with a wanion.

**3. FISH.**
==17==Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that were cast away before us even now.

**1. FISH.**
==18==Alas, poor souls, it griev’d my heart to hear what pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when, well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.

**3. FISH.**
==19==Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the porpoise how he bounc’d and tumbled? They say they’re half fish, half flesh. A plague on them, they ne’er come but I look to be wash’d. Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.

**1. FISH.**
==20==Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the little ones. I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly as to a whale: ’a plays and tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at last devour them all at a mouthful. Such whales have I heard on a’ th’ land, who never leave gaping till they swallow’d the whole parish, church, steeple, bells, and all.

**PER.**
*(Aside.)*
==21==A pretty moral.

**3. FISH.**
==22==But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have been that day in the belfry.

**2. FISH.**
==23==Why, man?

**3. FISH.**
==24==Because he should have swallow’d me too, and when I had been in his belly, I would have kept such a jangling of the bells, that he should never have left till he cast bells, steeple, church, and parish up again. But if the good King Simonides were of my mind⁠—

**PER.**
*(Aside.)*
==25==Simonides?

**3. FISH.**
==26==We would purge the land of these drones, that rob the bee of her honey.

**PER.**
*(Aside.)*
==27==How from the finny subject of the sea
==28==These fishers tell the infirmities of men,
==29==And from their wat’ry empire recollect
==30==All that may men approve or men detect!⁠—
==31==Peace be at your labor, honest fishermen.

**2. FISH.**
==32==Honest, good fellow, what’s that? If it be a day fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody look after it.

**PER.**
==33==May see the sea hath cast upon your coast⁠—

**2. FISH.**
==34==What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our way!

**PER.**
==35==A man whom both the waters and the wind,
==36==In that vast tennis-court, hath made the ball
==37==For them to play upon, entreats you pity him.
==38==He asks of you that never us’d to beg.

**1. FISH.**
==39==No, friend, cannot you beg? Here’s them in our country of Greece gets more with begging than we can do with working.

**2. FISH.**
==40==Canst thou catch any fishes then?

**PER.**
==41==I never practic’d it.

**2. FISH.**
==42==Nay then thou wilt starve sure; for here’s nothing to be got now-a-days unless thou canst fish for’t.

**PER.**
==43==What I have been I have forgot to know,
==44==But what I am, want teaches me to think on:
==45==A man throng’d up with cold, my veins are chill
==46==And have no more of life than may suffice
==47==To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;
==48==Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,
==49==For that I am a man, pray you see me buried.

**1. FISH.**
==50==Die, keth ’a? Now gods forbid’t, and I have a gown here! Come put it on, keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and we’ll have flesh for holidays, fish for fasting-days, and, moreo’er, puddings and flapjacks, and thou shalt be welcome.

**PER.**
==51==I thank you, sir.

**2. FISH.**
==52==Hark you, my friend. You said you could not beg?

**PER.**
==53==I did but crave.

**2. FISH.**
==54==But crave? Then I’ll turn craver too, and so I shall scape whipping.

**PER.**
==55==Why, are your beggars whipt then?

**2. FISH.**
==56==O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your beggars were whipt, I would wish no better office than to be beadle. But, master, I’ll go draw up the net.

*Exit with Third Fisherman.*

**PER.**
*(Aside.)*
==57==How well this honest mirth becomes their labor!

**1. FISH.**
==58==Hark you, sir; do you know where ye are?

**PER.**
==59==Not well.

**1. FISH.**
==60==Why, I’ll tell you. This is call’d Pentapolis, and our king the good Simonides.

**PER.**
==61==The good Simonides, do you call him?

**1. FISH.**
==62==Ay, sir, and he deserves so to be call’d for his peaceable reign and good government.

**PER.**
==63==He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects the name of good by his government. How far is his court distant from this shore?

**1. FISH.**
==64==Marry, sir, half a day’s journey. And I’ll tell you, he hath a fair daughter, and tomorrow is her birthday, and there are princes and knights come from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.

**PER.**
==65==Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish to make one there.

**1. FISH.**
==66==O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a man cannot get, he may lawfully deal for his wive’s soul.

*Enter the two other Fishermen drawing up a net.*

**2. FISH.**
==67==Help, master, help! Here’s a fish hangs in the net, like a poor man’s right in the law; ’twill hardly come out. Ha, bots on’t, ’tis come at last, and ’tis turn’d to a rusty armor.

**PER.**
==68==An armor, friends? I pray you let me see it.
==69==Thanks, Fortune, yet, that after all thy crosses,
==70==Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;
==71==And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,
==72==Which my dead father did bequeath to me,
==73==With this strict charge, even as he left his life,
==74==“Keep it, my Pericles, it hath been a shield
==75==’Twixt me and death”—and pointed to this brace⁠—
==76==“For that it sav’d me, keep it. In like necessity⁠—
==77==The which the gods protect thee from!—may defend thee.”
==78==It kept where I kept, I so dearly lov’d it,
==79==Till the rough seas, that spares not any man,
==80==Took it in rage, though calm’d have given’t again.
==81==I thank thee for’t. My shipwreck now’s no ill,
==82==Since I have here my father gave in his will.

**1. FISH.**
==83==What mean you, sir?

**PER.**
==84==To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
==85==For it was sometime target to a king;
==86==I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
==87==And for his sake I wish the having of it;
==88==And that you’d guide me to your sovereign’s court,
==89==Where with it I may appear a gentleman;
==90==And if that ever my low fortunes better,
==91==I’ll pay your bounties; till then, rest your debtor.

**1. FISH.**
==92==Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?

**PER.**
==93==I’ll show the virtue I have borne in arms.

**1. FISH.**
==94==Why, d’ ye take it, and the gods give thee good an’t!

**2. FISH.**
==95==Ay, but hark you, my friend, ’twas we that made up this garment through the rough seams of the waters. There are certain condolements, certain vails. I hope, sir, if you thrive, you’ll remember from whence you had them.

**PER.**
==96==Believe’t, I will.
==97==By your furtherance I am cloth’d in steel,
==98==And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,
==99==This jewel holds his building on my arm.
==100==Unto thy value I will mount myself
==101==Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
==102==Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
==103==Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided
==104==Of a pair of bases.

**2. FISH.**
==105==We’ll sure provide. Thou shalt have my best gown to make thee a pair; and I’ll bring thee to the court myself.

**PER.**
==106==Then honor be but a goal to my will,
==107==This day I’ll rise, or else add ill to ill.

*Exeunt.*
