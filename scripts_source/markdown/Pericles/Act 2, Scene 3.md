## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Pentapolis. A hall of state and a banquet.*

*A banquet prepared.*

*Enter the King Simonides, Thaisa, Marshal, Lords, Ladies, Attendants, and Knights, from tilting.*

**SIM.**
==1== Knights,
==2== To say you’re welcome were superfluous.
==3== To place upon the volume of your deeds,
==4== As in a title-page, your worth in arms,
==5== Were more than you expect, or more than’s fit,
==6== Since every worth in show commends itself.
==7== Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast.
==8== You are princes and my guests.

**THAI.**
==9== But you, my knight and guest,
==10== To whom this wreath of victory I give,
==11== And crown you king of this day’s happiness.

**PER.**
==12== ’Tis more by fortune, lady, than my merit.

**SIM.**
==13== Call it by what you will, the day is your,
==14== And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
==15== In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,
==16== To make some good, but others to exceed,
==17== And you are her labor’d scholar. Come, queen a’ th’ feast⁠—
==18== For, daughter, so you are—here take your place.
*(To the Marshal.)*
==19== Marshal, the rest, as they deserve their grace.

**ALL KNIGHTS.**
==20== We are honor’d much by good Simonides.

**SIM.**
==21== Your presence glads our days. Honor we love,
==22== For who hates honor hates the gods above.

**MARSHAL.**
==23== Sir, yonder is your place.

**PER.**
==23==               Some other is more fit.

**1. KNIGHT.**
==24== Contend not, sir, for we are gentlemen
==25== Have neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
==26== Envied the great, nor shall the low despise.

**PER.**
==27== You are right courteous knights.

**SIM.**
==27==                   Sit, sir, sit.
*(Aside.)*
==28== By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
==29== These cates resist me, he not thought upon.

**THAI.**
*(Aside.)*
==30== By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
==31== All viands that I eat do seem unsavory,
==32== Wishing him my meat.
*(To Simonides.)*
==32==               Sure he’s a gallant gentleman.

**SIM.**
*(To Thaisa.)*
==33== He’s but a country gentleman:
==34== H’as done no more than other knights have done,
==35== H’as broken a staff or so; so let it pass.

**THAI.**
*(Aside.)*
==36== To me he seems like diamond to glass.

**PER.**
*(Aside.)*
==37== Yon king’s to me like to my father’s picture,
==38== Which tells me in that glory once he was;
==39== Had princes sit like stars about his throne,
==40== And he the sun for them to reverence;
==41== None that beheld him but, like lesser lights,
==42== Did vail their crowns to his supremacy;
==43== Where now his son’s like a glow-worm in the night,
==44== The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:
==45== Whereby I see that Time’s the king of men,
==46== He’s both their parent, and he is their grave,
==47== And gives them what he will, not what they crave.

**SIM.**
==48== What, are you merry, knights?

**ALL KNIGHTS.**
==49== Who can be other in this royal presence?

**SIM.**
==50== Here, with a cup that’s stor’d unto the brim⁠—
==51== As do you love, fill to your mistress’ lips⁠—
==52== We drink this health to you.

**ALL KNIGHTS.**
==52==                 We thank your Grace.

**SIM.**
==53== Yet pause awhile,
==54== Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
==55== As if the entertainment in our court
==56== Had not a show might countervail his worth.
==57== Note it not you, Thaisa?

**THAI.**
==57==               What is’t
==58== To me, my father?

**SIM.**
==58==            O, attend, my daughter:
==59== Princes in this should live like gods above,
==60== Who freely give to every one that come
==61== To honor them;
==62== And princes not doing so are like to gnats,
==63== Which make a sound, but kill’d are wond’red at.
==64== Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
==65== Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.

**THAI.**
==66== Alas, my father, it befits not me
==67== Unto a stranger knight to be so bold.
==68== He may my proffer take for an offense,
==69== Since men take women’s gifts for impudence.

**SIM.**
==70== How?
==71== Do as I bid you, or you’ll move me else.

**THAI.**
*(Aside.)*
==72== Now by the gods, he could not please me better.

**SIM.**
==73== And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him
==74== Of whence he is, his name, and parentage.

**THAI.**
==75== The King my father, sir, has drunk to you⁠—

**PER.**
==76== I thank him.

**THAI.**
==77== Wishing it so much blood unto your life.

**PER.**
==78== I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.

**THAI.**
==79== And further, he desires to know of you
==80== Of whence you are, your name, and parentage.

**PER.**
==81== A gentleman of Tyre, my name, Pericles,
==82== My education been in arts and arms;
==83== Who, looking for adventures in the world,
==84== Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
==85== And after shipwrack driven upon this shore.

**THAI.**
==86== He thanks your Grace; names himself Pericles,
==87== A gentleman of Tyre,
==88== Who only by misfortune of the seas
==89== Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.

**SIM.**
==90== Now by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
==91== And will awake him from his melancholy.
==92== Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
==93== And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
==94== Even in your armors, as you are address’d,
==95== Will well become a soldier’s dance.
==96== I will not have excuse with saying this,
==97== Loud music is too harsh for ladies’ heads,
==98== Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
*(They dance.)*
==99== So, this was well ask’d, ’twas so well perform’d.
==100== Come, sir, here’s a lady that wants breathing too,
==101== And I have heard you knights of Tyre
==102== Are excellent in making ladies trip,
==103== And that their measures are as excellent.

**PER.**
==104== In those that practice them they are, my lord.

**SIM.**
==105== O, that’s as much as you would be denied
==106== Of your fair courtesy.
*(They Knights and Ladies dance.)*
==106==            Unclasp, unclasp:
==107== Thanks, gentlemen, to all, all have done well;
*(To Pericles.)*
==108== But you the best.—Pages and lights, to conduct
==109== These knights unto their several lodgings!
*(To Pericles.)*
==109==                        Yours, sir,
==110== We have given order be next our own.

**PER.**
==111== I am at your Grace’s pleasure.

**SIM.**
==112== Princes, it is too late to talk of love,
==113== And that’s the mark I know you level at.
==114== Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
==115== Tomorrow all for speeding do their best.

*Exeunt.*
