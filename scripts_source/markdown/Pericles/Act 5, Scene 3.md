## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[ị Epilogue|Epilogue →]]

*The temple of Diana at Ephesus.*

*Enter Gower.*

*Enter Pericles with his Train: Lysimachus, Helicanus, Marina, and a Lady.*

**PER.**
==1== Hail, Dian! To perform thy just command,
==2== I here confess myself the King of Tyre,
==3== Who frighted from my country, did wed
==4== At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
==5== At sea in child-bed died she, but brought forth
==6== A maid-child call’d Marina, whom, O goddess,
==7== Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tharsus
==8== Was nurs’d with Cleon, who at fourteen years
==9== He sought to murder, but her better stars
==10== Brought her to Mytilene, ’gainst whose shore
==11== Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
==12== Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
==13== Made known herself my daughter.

**THAI.**
==13==                   Voice and favor!
==14== You are, you are—O royal Pericles!

*Faints.*

**PER.**
==15== What means the nun? She dies, help, gentlemen!

**CER.**
==16== Noble sir,
==17== If you have told Diana’s altar true,
==18== This is your wife.

**PER.**
==18==            Reverent appearer, no,
==19== I threw her overboard with these very arms.

**CER.**
==20== Upon this coast, I warrant you.

**PER.**
==20==                 ’Tis most certain.

**CER.**
==21== Look to the lady; O, she’s but overjoy’d.
==22== Early in blustering morn this lady was
==23== Thrown upon this shore. I op’d the coffin,
==24== Found there rich jewels, recovered her, and plac’d her
==25== Here in Diana’s temple.

**PER.**
==25==               May we see them?

**CER.**
==26== Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
==27== Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is
==28== Recovered.

**THAI.**
==28==         O, let me look!
==29== If he be none of mine, my sanctity
==30== Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
==31== But curb it, spite of seeing. O my lord,
==32== Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,
==33== Like him you are! Did you not name a tempest,
==34== A birth, and death?

**PER.**
==34==            The voice of dead Thaisa!

**THAI.**
==35== That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
==36== And drown’d.

**PER.**
==37== Immortal Dian!

**THAI.**
==37==            Now I know you better.
==38== When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
==39== The King my father gave you such a ring.

*Points to his ring.*

**PER.**
==40== This, this. No more, you gods! Your present kindness
==41== Makes my past miseries sports. You shall do well
==42== That on the touching of her lips I may
==43== Melt, and no more be seen. O, come, be buried
==44== A second time within these arms.

**MAR.**
==44==                   My heart
==45== Leaps to be gone into my mother’s bosom.

*Kneels to Thaisa.*

**PER.**
==46== Look who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa,
==47== Thy burden at the sea, and call’d Marina
==48== For she was yielded there.

**THAI.**
==48==               Blest, and mine own!

**HEL.**
==49== Hail, madam, and my queen!

**THAI.**
==49==                 I know you not.

**PER.**
==50== You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
==51== I left behind an ancient substitute.
==52== Can you remember what I call’d the man?
==53== I have nam’d him oft.

**THAI.**
==53==            ’Twas Helicanus then.

**PER.**
==54== Still confirmation!
==55== Embrace him, dear Thaisa, this is he.
==56== Now do I long to hear how you were found,
==57== How possibly preserved, and who to thank
==58== (Besides the gods) for this great miracle.

**THAI.**
==59== Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
==60== Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can
==61== From first to last resolve you.

**PER.**
==61==                 Reverent sir,
==62== The gods can have no mortal officer
==63== More like a god than you. Will you deliver
==64== How this dead queen relives?

**CER.**
==64==                 I will, my lord.
==65== Beseech you first, go with me to my house,
==66== Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
==67== How she came plac’d here in the temple;
==68== No needful thing omitted.

**PER.**
==68==               Pure Dian,
==69== I bless thee for thy vision, and will offer
==70== Night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
==71== This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
==72== Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now
==73== This ornament
==74== Makes me look dismal will I clip to form,
==75== And what this fourteen years no razor touch’d,
==76== To grace thy marriage-day, I’ll beautify.

**THAI.**
==77== Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
==78== My father’s dead.

**PER.**
==79== Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
==80== We’ll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
==81== Will in that kingdom spend our following days.
==82== Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
==83== Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
==84== To hear the rest untold. Sir, lead ’s the way.

*Exeunt.*
