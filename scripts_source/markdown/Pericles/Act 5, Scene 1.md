## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 5, Prologue|← Act 5, Prologue]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*On board Pericles’s ship, off Mytilene.*

*On board Pericles’ ship, off Mytilene. A close pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; Pericles within it, reclined on a couch.*

*Enter Helicanus; to him two Sailors, one of Tyre, the other of Mytilene.*

**TYR. SAIL.**
*(To the Sailor of Mytilene.)*
==1== Where is Lord Helicanus? He can resolve you.
==2== O, here he is.⁠—
==3== Sir, there is a barge put off from Mytilene,
==4== And in it is Lysimachus the governor,
==5== Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?

**HEL.**
==6== That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.

**TYR. SAIL.**
==7== Ho, gentlemen! My lord calls.

*Enter two or three Gentlemen.*

**1. GENT. TYRE.**
==8== Doth your lordship call?

**HEL.**
==9== Gentlemen, there is some of worth would come aboard;
==10== I pray greet him fairly.

*Exeunt Gentlemen, Sailor of Tyre and Sailor of Mytilene.*

*Enter Lysimachus and Lords with the Gentlemen and the Tyrian Sailor.*

**TYR. SAIL.**
==11== Sir,
==12== This is the man that can, in aught you would,
==13== Resolve you.

**LYS.**
==14== Hail, reverent sir! The gods preserve you!

**HEL.**
==15== And you, to outlive the age I am,
==16== And die as I would do.

**LYS.**
==16==               You wish me well.
==17== Being on shore, honoring of Neptune’s triumphs,
==18== Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
==19== I made to it to know of whence you are.

**HEL.**
==20== First, what is your place?

**LYS.**
==21== I am the governor of this place you lie before.

**HEL.**
==22== Sir,
==23== Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the King,
==24== A man who for this three months hath not spoken
==25== To any one, nor taken sustenance
==26== But to prorogue his grief.

**LYS.**
==27== Upon what ground is his distemperature?

**HEL.**
==28== ’Twould be too tedious to repeat,
==29== But the main grief springs from the loss
==30== Of a beloved daughter and a wife.

**LYS.**
==31== May we not see him?

**HEL.**
==32== You may,
==33== But bootless is your sight; he will not speak
==34== To any.

**LYS.**
==35== Yet let me obtain my wish.

**HEL.**
==36== Behold him.
*(Pericles discovered.)*
==36==         This was a goodly person,
==37== Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
==38== Drove him to this.

**LYS.**
==39== Sir King, all hail! The gods preserve you! Hail, royal sir!

**HEL.**
==40== It is in vain, he will not speak to you.

**LORD. MYT.**
==41== Sir,
==42== We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,
==43== Would win some words of him.

**LYS.**
==43==                 ’Tis well bethought.
==44== She questionless with her sweet harmony,
==45== And other chosen attractions, would allure
==46== And make a batt’ry through his deafen’d parts,
==47== Which now are midway stopp’d.
==48== She is all happy as the fairest of all,
==49== And with her fellow maids, is now upon
==50== The leavy shelter that abuts against
==51== The island’s side.

*Gives an order to a Lord, who goes out.*

**HEL.**
==52== Sure all effectless; yet nothing we’ll omit
==53== That bears recovery’s name. But since your kindness
==54== We have stretch’d thus far, let us beseech you
==55== That for our gold we may provision have,
==56== Wherein we are not destitute for want,
==57== But weary for the staleness.

**LYS.**
==57==               O sir, a courtesy
==58== Which if we should deny, the most just God
==59== For every graff would send a caterpillar,
==60== And so inflict our province. Yet once more
==61== Let me entreat to know at large the cause
==62== Of your king’s sorrow.

**HEL.**
==62==            Sit, sir, I will recount it to you,
==63== But see, I am prevented.

*Enter Lord with Marina and a young Lady.*

**LYS.**
==64== O, here’s
==65== The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!
==66== —Is’t not a goodly presence?

**HEL.**
==66==                 She’s a gallant lady.

**LYS.**
==67== She’s such a one that were I well assur’d
==68== Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
==69== I’d wish no better choice, and think me rarely to wed.
==70== Fair one, all goodness that consists in beauty,
==71== Expect even here, where is a kingly patient,
==72== If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
==73== Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
==74== Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
==75== As thy desires can wish.

**MAR.**
==75==               Sir, I will use
==76== My utmost skill in his recovery, provided
==77== That none but I and my companion maid
==78== Be suffered to come near him.

**LYS.**
==78==                 Come, let us leave her,
==79== And the gods make her prosperous!

*They withdraw. Marina sings the song.*

**LYS.**
*(Advances.)*
==80== Mark’d he your music?

**MAR.**
==81== No, nor look’d on us.

**LYS.**
==82== See, she will speak to him.

**MAR.**
==83== Hail, sir! My lord, lend ear.

**PER.**
==84== Hum, ha!

*Pushing her roughly back.*

**MAR.**
==85== I am a maid,
==86== My lord, that ne’er before invited eyes,
==87== But have been gaz’d on like a comet. She speaks,
==88== My lord, that, may be, hath endur’d a grief
==89== Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh’d.
==90== Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
==91== My derivation was from ancestors
==92== Who stood equivalent with mighty kings,
==93== But time hath rooted out my parentage,
==94== And to the world and awkward casualties
==95== Bound me in servitude.
*(Aside.)*
==95==               I will desist,
==96== But there is something glows upon my cheek,
==97== And whispers in mine ear, “Go not till he speak.”

**PER.**
==98== My fortunes—parentage—good parentage⁠—
==99== To equal mine—was it not thus? What say you?

**MAR.**
==100== I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
==101== You would not do me violence.

**PER.**
==102== I do think so. Pray you turn your eyes upon me.
==103== You’re like something that—What country-woman?
==104== Here of these shores?

**MAR.**
==104==            No, nor of any shores,
==105== Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
==106== No other than I appear.

**PER.**
==107== I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
==108== My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
==109== My daughter might have been. My queen’s square brows,
==110== Her stature to an inch, as wand-like straight,
==111== As silver-voic’d, her eyes as jewel-like
==112== And cas’d as richly, in pace another Juno;
==113== Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
==114== The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?

**MAR.**
==115== Where I am but a stranger. From the deck
==116== You may discern the place.

**PER.**
==116==               Where were you bred?
==117== And how achiev’d you these endowments which
==118== You make more rich to owe?

**MAR.**
==119== If I should tell my history, it would seem
==120== Like lies disdain’d in the reporting.

**PER.**
==120==                   Prithee speak.
==121== Falseness cannot come from thee, for thou lookest
==122== Modest as Justice, and thou seemest a palace
==123== For the crown’d Truth to dwell in. I will believe thee,
==124== And make my senses credit thy relation
==125== To points that seem impossible, for thou lookest
==126== Like one I lov’d indeed. What were thy friends?
==127== Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back⁠—
==128== Which was when I perceiv’d thee—that thou cam’st
==129== From good descending?

**MAR.**
==129==               So indeed I did.

**PER.**
==130== Report thy parentage. I think thou saidst
==131== Thou hadst been toss’d from wrong to injury,
==132== And that thou thoughts’ thy griefs might equal mine,
==133== If both were opened.

**MAR.**
==133==            Some such thing
==134== I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
==135== Did warrant me was likely.

**PER.**
==135==               Tell thy story;
==136== If thine, considered, prove the thousand part
==137== Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
==138== Have suffered like a girl. Yet thou dost look
==139== Like Patience gazing on kings’ graves, and smiling
==140== Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
==141== How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
==142== Recount, I do beseech thee. Come sit by me.

**MAR.**
==143== My name is Marina.

**PER.**
==143==            O, I am mock’d,
==144== And thou by some incensed god sent hither
==145== To make the world to laugh at me.

**MAR.**
==145==                   Patience, good sir!
==146== Or here I’ll cease.

**PER.**
==146==            Nay, I’ll be patient.
==147== Thou little know’st how thou dost startle me
==148== To call thyself Marina.

**MAR.**
==148==               The name
==149== Was given me by one that had some power,
==150== My father, and a king.

**PER.**
==150==            How, a king’s daughter?
==151== And call’d Marina?

**MAR.**
==151==            You said you would believe me,
==152== But not to be a troubler of your peace,
==153== I will end here.

**PER.**
==153==         But are you flesh and blood?
==154== Have you a working pulse, and are no fairy?
==155== Motion? Well, speak on. Where were you born?
==156== And wherefore call’d Marina?

**MAR.**
==156==                 Call’d Marina
==157== For I was born at sea.

**PER.**
==157==            At sea! What mother?

**MAR.**
==158== My mother was the daughter of a king,
==159== Who died the minute I was born,
==160== As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
==161== Delivered weeping.

**PER.**
==161==            O, stop there a little!
*(Aside.)*
==162== This is the rarest dream that e’er dull’d sleep
==163== Did mock sad fools withal. This cannot be
==164== My daughter—buried!—Well, where were you bred?
==165== I’ll hear you more, to th’ bottom of your story,
==166== And never interrupt you.

**MAR.**
==167== You scorn. Believe me, ’twere best I did give o’er.

**PER.**
==168== I will believe you by the syllable
==169== Of what you shall deliver. Yet give me leave:
==170== How came you in these parts? Where were you bred?

**MAR.**
==171== The King my father did in Tharsus leave me,
==172== Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
==173== Did seek to murder me; and having wooed
==174== A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do’t,
==175== A crew of pirates came and rescued me;
==176== Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
==177== Whither will you have me? Why do you weep? It may be
==178== You think me an imposture. No, good faith;
==179== I am the daughter to King Pericles,
==180== If good King Pericles be.

**PER.**
==181== Ho, Helicanus!

**HEL.**
==182== Calls my lord?

**PER.**
==183== Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
==184== Most wise in general, tell me if thou canst,
==185== What this maid is, or what is like to be,
==186== That thus hath made me weep.

**HEL.**
==186==                 I know not, but
==187== Here’s the regent, sir, of Mytilene
==188== Speaks nobly of her.

**LYS.**
==188==            She never would tell
==189== Her parentage; being demanded that,
==190== She would sit still and weep.

**PER.**
==191== O Helicanus, strike me, honored sir,
==192== Give me a gash, put me to present pain,
==193== Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
==194== O’erbear the shores of my mortality,
==195== And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,
==196== Thou that beget’st him that did thee beget;
==197== Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tharsus,
==198== And found at sea again! O Helicanus,
==199== Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
==200== As thunder threatens us. This is Marina.
==201== What was thy mother’s name? Tell me but that,
==202== For truth can never be confirm’d enough,
==203== Though doubts did ever sleep.

**MAR.**
==203==                 First, sir, I pray,
==204== What is your title?

**PER.**
==205== I am Pericles of Tyre; but tell me now
==206== My drown’d queen’s name, as in the rest you said
==207== Thou hast been godlike perfit,
==208== The heir of kingdoms, and another life
==209== To Pericles thy father.

**MAR.**
==210== Is it no more to be your daughter than
==211== To say my mother’s name was Thaisa?
==212== Thaisa was my mother, who did end
==213== The minute I began.

**PER.**
==214== Now blessing on thee! Rise, th’ art my child.
==215== Give me fresh garments. Mine own Helicanus,
==216== She is not dead at Tharsus as she should have been
==217== By savage Cleon. She shall tell thee all,
==218== When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
==219== She is thy very princess. Who is this?

**HEL.**
==220== Sir, ’tis the governor of Mytilene,
==221== Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
==222== Did come to see you.

**PER.**
==222==            I embrace you.
==223== Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
==224== O heavens bless my girl! But hark, what music?
==225== Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
==226== O’er, point by point, for yet he seems to dote,
==227== How sure you are my daughter. But what music?

**HEL.**
==228== My lord, I hear none.

**PER.**
==229== None?
==230== The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.

**LYS.**
==231== It is not good to cross him, give him way.

**PER.**
==232== Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?

**LYS.**
==233== Music, my lord? I hear.

**PER.**
==234== Most heavenly music!
==235== It nips me unto list’ning, and thick slumber
==236== Hangs upon mine eyes. Let me rest.

*Sleeps.*

**LYS.**
==237== A pillow for his head.
==238== So leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
==239== If this but answer to my just belief,
==240== I’ll well remember you.

*Exeunt all but Pericles.*

*Diana appears to Pericles as in a vision.*

**DIA.**
==241== My temple stands in Ephesus, hie thee thither,
==242== And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
==243== There, when my maiden priests are met together
==244== Before the people all,
==245== Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife.
==246== To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter’s, call
==247== And give them repetition to the life.
==248== Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;
==249== Do’t, and happy, by my silver bow!
==250== Awake, and tell thy dream.

*Disappears.*

**PER.**
==251== Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,
==252== I will obey thee. Helicanus!

*Enter Helicanus, Lysimachus, and Marina.*

**HEL.**
==252==                 Sir?

**PER.**
==253== My purpose was for Tharsus, there to strike
==254== The inhospitable Cleon, but I am
==255== For other service first. Toward Ephesus
==256== Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I’ll tell thee why.
*(To Lysimachus.)*
==257== Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
==258== And give you gold for such provision
==259== As our intents will need?

**LYS.**
==260== Sir,
==261== With all my heart, and, when you come ashore,
==262== I have another suit.

**PER.**
==262==            You shall prevail,
==263== Were it to woo my daughter, for it seems
==264== You have been noble towards her.

**LYS.**
==264==                   Sir, lend me your arm.

**PER.**
==265== Come, my Marina.

*Exeunt.*
