## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Tyre. An antechamber in the palace.*

*Enter Thaliard solus.*

**THAL.**
==1== So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hang’d at home. ’Tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desir’d he might know none of his secrets. Now do I see he had some reason for’t; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he’s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Husht! Here comes the lords of Tyre.

*Enter Helicanus, Escanes, with other Lords.*

**HEL.**
==2== You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
==3== Further to question me of your king’s departure.
==4== His seal’d commission, left in trust with me,
==5== Does speak sufficiently he’s gone to travel.

**THAL.**
*(Aside.)*
==6== How? The King gone?

**HEL.**
==7== If further yet you will be satisfied
==8== Why (as it were unlicens’d of your loves) 
==9== He would depart, I’ll give some light unto you.
==10== Being at Antioch⁠—

**THAL.**
*(Aside.)*
==10==            What from Antioch?

**HEL.**
==11== Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not,
==12== Took some displeasure at him, at lease he judg’d so;
==13== And doubting lest he had err’d or sinn’d,
==14== To show his sorrow, he’d correct himself;
==15== So puts himself unto the shipman’s toil,
==16== With whom each minute threatens life or death.

**THAL.**
*(Aside.)*
==17== Well, I perceive
==18== I shall not be hang’d now, although I would;
==19== But since he’s gone, the King’s seas must please:
==20== He scap’d the land to perish at the sea.
==21== I’ll present myself.—Peace to the lords of Tyre!

**HEL.**
==22== Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.

**THAL.**
==23== From him I come
==24== With message unto princely Pericles,
==25== But since my landing I have understood
==26== Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels;
==27== Now message must return from whence it came.

**HEL.**
==28== We have no reason to desire it,
==29== Commended to our master, not to us;
==30== Yet ere you shall depart, this we desire,
==31== As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.

*Exeunt.*
