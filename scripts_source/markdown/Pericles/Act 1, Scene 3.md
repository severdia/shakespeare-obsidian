## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Tyre. An antechamber in the palace.*

*Enter Thaliard solus.*

**THAL.**
So this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to be hang’d at home. ’Tis dangerous. Well, I perceive he was a wise fellow and had good discretion that, being bid to ask what he would of the king, desir’d he might know none of his secrets. Now do I see he had some reason for’t; for if a king bid a man be a villain, he’s bound by the indenture of his oath to be one. Husht! Here comes the lords of Tyre.

*Enter Helicanus, Escanes, with other Lords.*

**HEL.**
You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
Further to question me of your king’s departure.
His seal’d commission, left in trust with me,
Does speak sufficiently he’s gone to travel.

**THAL.**
*(Aside.)*
How? The King gone?

**HEL.**
If further yet you will be satisfied
Why (as it were unlicens’d of your loves) 
He would depart, I’ll give some light unto you.
Being at Antioch⁠—

**THAL.**
*(Aside.)*
           What from Antioch?

**HEL.**
Royal Antiochus, on what cause I know not,
Took some displeasure at him, at lease he judg’d so;
And doubting lest he had err’d or sinn’d,
To show his sorrow, he’d correct himself;
So puts himself unto the shipman’s toil,
With whom each minute threatens life or death.

**THAL.**
*(Aside.)*
Well, I perceive
I shall not be hang’d now, although I would;
But since he’s gone, the King’s seas must please:
He scap’d the land to perish at the sea.
I’ll present myself.—Peace to the lords of Tyre!

**HEL.**
Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.

**THAL.**
From him I come
With message unto princely Pericles,
But since my landing I have understood
Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels;
Now message must return from whence it came.

**HEL.**
We have no reason to desire it,
Commended to our master, not to us;
Yet ere you shall depart, this we desire,
As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.

*Exeunt.*
