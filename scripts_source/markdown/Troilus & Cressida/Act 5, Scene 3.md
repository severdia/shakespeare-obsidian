## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Troy. Before Priam’s palace.*

*Enter Hector and Andromache.*

**AND.**
==1==When was my lord so much ungently temper’d
==2==To stop his ears against admonishment?
==3==Unarm, unarm, and do not fight today.

**HECT.**
==4==You train me to offend you, get you in.
==5==By all the everlasting gods, I’ll go!

**AND.**
==6==My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day.

**HECT.**
==7==No more, I say.

*Enter Cassandra.*

**CAS.**
==7==           Where is my brother Hector?

**AND.**
==8==Here, sister, arm’d, and bloody in intent.
==9==Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
==10==Pursue we him on knees; for I have dreamt
==11==Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
==12==Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.

**CAS.**
==13==O, ’tis true.

**HECT.**
==13==        Ho! Bid my trumpet sound!

**CAS.**
==14==No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.

**HECT.**
==15==Be gone, I say, the gods have heard me swear.

**CAS.**
==16==The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows;
==17==They are polluted off’rings, more abhorr’d
==18==Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.

**AND.**
==19==O, be persuaded! Do not count it holy
==20==To hurt by being just; it is as lawful,
==21==For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
==22==And rob in the behalf of charity.

**CAS.**
==23==It is the purpose that makes strong the vow,
==24==But vows to every purpose must not hold;
==25==Unarm, sweet Hector.

**HECT.**
==25==           Hold you still, I say;
==26==Mine honor keeps the weather of my fate.
==27==Life every man holds dear, but the dear man
==28==Holds honor far more precious-dear than life.
*(Enter Troilus.)*
==29==How now, young man, meanest thou to fight today?

**AND.**
==30==Cassandra, call my father to persuade.

*Exit Cassandra.*

**HECT.**
==31==No, faith, young Troilus, doff thy harness, youth,
==32==I am today i’ th’ vein of chivalry.
==33==Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
==34==And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
==35==Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
==36==I’ll stand today for thee and me and Troy.

**TRO.**
==37==Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
==38==Which better fits a lion than a man.

**HECT.**
==39==What vice is that? Good Troilus, chide me for it.

**TRO.**
==40==When many times the captive Grecian falls,
==41==Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
==42==You bid them rise and live.

**HECT.**
==43==O, ’tis fair play.

**TRO.**
==43==        Fool’s play, by heaven, Hector.

**HECT.**
==44==How now? How now?

**TRO.**
==44==           For th’ love of all the gods,
==45==Let’s leave the hermit pity with our mother,
==46==And when we have our armors buckled on,
==47==The venom’d vengeance ride upon our swords,
==48==Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.

**HECT.**
==49==Fie, savage, fie!

**TRO.**
==49==        Hector, then ’tis wars.

**HECT.**
==50==Troilus, I would not have you fight today.

**TRO.**
==51==Who should withhold me?
==52==Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
==53==Beck’ning with fiery truncheon my retire,
==54==Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
==55==Their eyes o’ergalled with recourse of tears,
==56==Nor you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
==57==Oppos’d to hinder me, should stop my way,
==58==But by my ruin.

*Enter Priam and Cassandra.*

**CAS.**
==59==Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast,
==60==He is thy crutch. Now if thou lose thy stay,
==61==Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
==62==Fall all together.

**PRI.**
==62==        Come, Hector, come, go back.
==63==Thy wife hath dreamt, thy mother hath had visions,
==64==Cassandra doth foresee, and I myself
==65==Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
==66==To tell thee that this day is ominous:
==67==Therefore come back.

**HECT.**
==67==           Aeneas is a-field,
==68==And I do stand engag’d to many Greeks,
==69==Even in the faith of valor, to appear
==70==This morning to them.

**PRI.**
==70==              Ay, but thou shalt not go.

**HECT.**
==71==I must not break my faith.
==72==You know me dutiful, therefore, dear sir,
==73==Let me not shame respect, but give me leave
==74==To take that course by your consent and voice,
==75==Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.

**CAS.**
==76==O Priam, yield not to him.

**AND.**
==76==              Do not, dear father.

**HECT.**
==77==Andromache, I am offended with you,
==78==Upon the love you bear me, get you in.

*Exit Andromache.*

**TRO.**
==79==This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
==80==Makes all these bodements.

**CAS.**
==80==              O, farewell, dear Hector.
==81==Look how thou diest, look how thy eye turns pale.
==82==Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents,
==83==Hark how Troy roars, how Hecuba cries out,
==84==How poor Andromache shrills her dolors forth.
==85==Behold, distraction, frenzy, and amazement,
==86==Like witless antics, one another meet,
==87==And all cry, Hector! Hector’s dead! O Hector!

**TRO.**
==88==Away, away.

**CAS.**
==89==Farewell; yet soft: Hector, I take my leave.
==90==Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.

*Exit.*

**HECT.**
==91==You are amaz’d, my liege, at her exclaim.
==92==Go in and cheer the town. We’ll forth and fight,
==93==Do deeds worth praise, and tell you them at night.

**PRI.**
==94==Farewell, the gods with safety stand about thee!

*Exeunt severally Priam and Hector. Alarum.*

**TRO.**
==95==They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
==96==I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.

*Enter Pandar.*

**PAN.**
==97==Do you hear, my lord? Do you hear?

**TRO.**
==98==What now?

**PAN.**
==99==Here’s a letter come from yond poor girl.

**TRO.**
==100==Let me read.

**PAN.**
==101==A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl, and what one thing, what another, that I shall leave you one a’ th’s days; and I have a rheum in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones, that unless a man were curs’d, I cannot tell what to think on’t. What says she there?

**TRO.**
==102==Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart;
==103==Th’ effect doth operate another way.
*(Tearing the letter.)*
==104==Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.
==105==My love with words and errors still she feeds,
==106==But edifies another with her deeds.

*Exeunt severally.*
