## Act 4, Scene 4
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 5|Act 4, Scene 5 →]]

*Troy. Pandarus’s House.*

*Enter Pandarus and Cressida.*

**PAN.**
==1==Be moderate, be moderate.

**CRES.**
==2==Why tell you me of moderation?
==3==The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
==4==And violenteth in a sense as strong
==5==As that which causeth it. How can I moderate it?
==6==If I could temporize with my affections,
==7==Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
==8==The like allayment could I give my grief:
==9==My love admits no qualifying dross,
==10==No more my grief, in such a precious loss.

*Enter Troilus.*

**PAN.**
==11==Here, here, here he comes. Ah, sweet ducks!

**CRES.**
==12==O Troilus, Troilus!

*Embracing him.*

**PAN.**
==13==What a pair of spectacles is here! Let me embrace too. “O heart,” as the goodly saying is,
==14==*“O heart, heavy heart,*
==15==*Why sigh’st thou without breaking?”*
==16==Where he answers again,
==17==*“Because thou canst not ease thy smart*
==18==*By friendship nor by speaking.”*
==19==There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away nothing, for we may live to have need of such a verse. We see it, we see it. How now, lambs?

**TRO.**
==20==Cressid, I love thee in so strain’d a purity
==21==That the blest gods, as angry with my fancy,
==22==More bright in zeal than the devotion which
==23==Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.

**CRES.**
==24==Have the gods envy?

**PAN.**
==25==Ay, ay, ay, ay, ’tis too plain a case.

**CRES.**
==26==And is it true that I must go from Troy?

**TRO.**
==27==A hateful truth.

**CRES.**
==27==        What, and from Troilus too?

**TRO.**
==28==From Troy and Troilus.

**CRES.**
==28==              Is’t possible?

**TRO.**
==29==And suddenly, where injury of chance
==30==Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
==31==All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
==32==Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
==33==Our lock’d embrasures, strangles our dear vows
==34==Even in the birth of our own laboring breath.
==35==We two, that with so many thousand sighs
==36==Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
==37==With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
==38==Injurious time now with a robber’s haste
==39==Crams his rich thiev’ry up, he knows not how.
==40==As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
==41==With distinct breath and consign’d kisses to them,
==42==He fumbles up into a loose *adieu*;
==43==And scants us with a single famish’d kiss,
==44==Distasted with the salt of broken tears.

**AENE.**
*(Within.)*
==45==My lord, is the lady ready?

**TRO.**
==46==Hark, you are call’d. Some say the Genius so
==47==Cries “come” to him that instantly must die.
==48==—Bid them have patience, she shall come anon.

**PAN.**
==49==Where are my tears? Rain, to lay this wind, or my heart will be blown up by th’ root.

*Exit.*

**CRES.**
==50==I must then to the Grecians?

**TRO.**
==50==                No remedy.

**CRES.**
==51==A woeful Cressid ’mongst the merry Greeks!
==52==When shall we see again?

**TRO.**
==53==Hear me, love. Be thou but true of heart⁠—

**CRES.**
==54==I true? How now? What wicked deem is this?

**TRO.**
==55==Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
==56==For it is parting from us.
==57==I speak not “be thou true” as fearing thee,
==58==For I will throw my glove to Death himself
==59==That there is no maculation in thy heart;
==60==But “be thou true” say I to fashion in
==61==My sequent protestation: be thou true,
==62==And I will see thee.

**CRES.**
==63==O, you shall be expos’d, my lord, to dangers
==64==As infinite as imminent! But I’ll be true.

**TRO.**
==65==And I’ll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.

**CRES.**
==66==And you this glove. When shall I see you?

**TRO.**
==67==I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
==68==To give thee nightly visitation.
==69==But yet be true.

**CRES.**
==69==        O heavens, “be true” again?

**TRO.**
==70==Hear why I speak it, love.
==71==The Grecian youths are full of quality;
==72==Their loving well compos’d with gift of nature,
==73==Flowing and swelling o’er with arts and exercise.
==74==How novelty may move, and parts with person,
==75==Alas, a kind of godly jealousy
==76==(Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin) 
==77==Makes me afeard.

**CRES.**
==77==           O heavens, you love me not.

**TRO.**
==78==Die I a villain then!
==79==In this I do not call your faith in question
==80==So mainly as my merit. I cannot sing,
==81==Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
==82==Nor play at subtle games—fair virtues all,
==83==To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant⁠—
==84==But I can tell that in each grace of these
==85==There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
==86==That tempts most cunningly, but be not tempted.

**CRES.**
==87==Do you think I will?

**TRO.**
==88==No,
==89==But something may be done that we will not,
==90==And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
==91==When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
==92==Presuming on their changeful potency.

**AENE.**
*(Within.)*
==93==Nay, good my lord!

**TRO.**
==93==           Come kiss, and let us part.

**PAR.**
*(Within.)*
==94==Brother Troilus!

**TRO.**
==94==        Good brother, come you hither,
==95==And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you.

**CRES.**
==96==My lord, will you be true?

**TRO.**
==97==Who, I? Alas, it is my vice, my fault:
==98==Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
==99==I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
==100==Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
==101==With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
==102==Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
==103==Is “plain and true”; there’s all the reach of it.
*(Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus, and Diomedes.)*
==104==Welcome, Sir Diomed! Here is the lady
==105==Which for Antenor we deliver you.
==106==At the port, lord, I’ll give her to thy hand,
==107==And by the way possess thee what she is.
==108==Entreat her fair, and, by my soul, fair Greek,
==109==If e’er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
==110==Name Cressid, and thy life shall be as safe
==111==As Priam is in Ilion.

**DIO.**
==111==           Fair Lady Cressid,
==112==So please you, save the thanks this prince expects.
==113==The luster in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
==114==Pleads your fair usage, and to Diomed
==115==You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.

**TRO.**
==116==Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
==117==To shame the seal of my petition to thee
==118==In praising her. I tell thee, lord of Greece,
==119==She is as far high-soaring o’er thy praises
==120==As thou unworthy to be call’d her servant.
==121==I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;
==122==For by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
==123==Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
==124==I’ll cut thy throat.

**DIO.**
==124==           O, be not mov’d, Prince Troilus.
==125==Let me be privileg’d by my place and message,
==126==To be a speaker free. When I am hence,
==127==I’ll answer to my lust, and know you, lord,
==128==I’ll nothing do on charge. To her own worth
==129==She shall be priz’d; but that you say, “Be’t so,”
==130==I speak it in my spirit and honor, “No.”

**TRO.**
==131==Come, to the port. I’ll tell thee, Diomed,
==132==This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
==133==Lady, give me your hand, and as we walk,
==134==To our own selves bend we our needful talk.

*Exeunt Troilus, Cressida, and Diomedes. Sound trumpet.*

**PAR.**
==135==Hark, Hector’s trumpet!

**AENE.**
==135==              How have we spent this morning!
==136==The Prince must think me tardy and remiss,
==137==That swore to ride before him to the field.

**PAR.**
==138==’Tis Troilus’ fault. Come, come, to field with him.

**DEI.**
==139==Let us make ready straight.

**AENE.**
==140==Yea, with a bridegroom’s fresh alacrity
==141==Let us address to tend on Hector’s heels.
==142==The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
==143==On his fair worth and single chivalry.

*Exeunt.*
