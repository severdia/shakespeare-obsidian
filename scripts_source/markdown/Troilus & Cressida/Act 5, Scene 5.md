## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 6|Act 5, Scene 6 →]]

*Another part of the plains.*

*Enter Diomedes and his Servant.*

**DIO.**
==1==Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus’ horse,
==2==Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid.
==3==Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;
==4==Tell her I have chastis’d the amorous Troyan,
==5==And am her knight by proof.

**DIO. SERV.**
==5==                I go, my lord.

*Exit.*

*Enter Agamemnon.*

**AGAM.**
==6==Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas
==7==Hath beat down Menon; bastard Margarelon
==8==Hath Doreus prisoner,
==9==And stands Colossus-wise, waving his beam,
==10==Upon the pashed corses of the kings
==11==Epistrophus and Cedius; Polyxenes is slain,
==12==Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
==13==Patroclus ta’en or slain, and Palamedes
==14==Sore hurt and bruised. The dreadful Sagittary
==15==Appalls our numbers. Haste we, Diomed,
==16==To reinforcement, or we perish all.

*Enter Nestor.*

**NEST.**
==17==Go bear Patroclus’ body to Achilles,
==18==And bid the snail-pac’d Ajax arm for shame.
==19==There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
==20==Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
==21==And there lacks work; anon he’s there afoot,
==22==And there they fly or die, like scaling sculls
==23==Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
==24==And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
==25==Fall down before him like a mower’s swath.
==26==Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
==27==Dexterity so obeying appetite
==28==That what he will he does, and does so much
==29==That proof is call’d impossibility.

*Enter Ulysses.*

**ULYSS.**
==30==O, courage, courage, princes! Great Achilles
==31==Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance.
==32==Patroclus’ wounds have rous’d his drowsy blood,
==33==Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
==34==That noseless, handless, hack’d and chipp’d, come to him,
==35==Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend,
==36==And foams at mouth, and he is arm’d and at it,
==37==Roaring for Troilus, who hath done today
==38==Mad and fantastic execution,
==39==Engaging and redeeming of himself
==40==With such a careless force, and forceless care,
==41==As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,
==42==Bade him win all.

*Enter Ajax.*

**AJAX.**
==43==Troilus, thou coward Troilus!

*Exit.*

**DIO.**
==44==Ay, there, there.

**NEST.**
==45==So, so, we draw together.

*Exit.*

*Enter Achilles.*

**ACHIL.**
==45==              Where is this Hector?
==46==Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face,
==47==Know what it is to meet Achilles angry.
==48==Hector, where’s Hector? I will none but Hector.

*Exeunt.*
