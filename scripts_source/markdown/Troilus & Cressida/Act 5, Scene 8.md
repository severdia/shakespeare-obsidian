## Act 5, Scene 8
[[Act 5, Scene 7|← Act 5, Scene 7]] | [[Act 5, Scene 9|Act 5, Scene 9 →]]

*Another part of the plains.*

*Enter Hector.*

**HECT.**
==1==Most putrefied core, so fair without,
==2==Thy goodly armor thus hath cost thy life.
==3==Now is my day’s work done, I’ll take good breath.
==4==Rest, sword, thou hast thy fill of blood and death.

*Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him.*

*Enter Achilles and Myrmidons.*

**ACHIL.**
==5==Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set,
==6==How ugly night comes breathing at his heels;
==7==Even with the vail and dark’ning of the sun,
==8==To close the day up, Hector’s life is done.

**HECT.**
==9==I am unarm’d, forgo this vantage, Greek.

**ACHIL.**
==10==Strike, fellows, strike, this is the man I seek.
*(Hector falls.)*
==11==So, Ilion, fall thou next! Come, Troy, sink down!
==12==Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
==13==On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
==14==“Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain!”
*(Retreat.)*
==15==Hark, a retire upon our Grecian part.

**MYR.**
==16==The Troyans’ trumpet sound the like, my lord.

**ACHIL.**
==17==The dragon wing of night o’erspreads the earth,
==18==And stickler-like the armies separates.
==19==My half-supp’d sword that frankly would have fed,
==20==Pleas’d with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
*(Sheathes his sword.)*
==21==Come tie his body to my horse’s tail,
==22==Along the field I will the Troyan trail.

*Exeunt.*
