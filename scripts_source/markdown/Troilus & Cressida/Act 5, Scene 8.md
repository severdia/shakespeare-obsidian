## Act 5, Scene 8
[[Act 5, Scene 7|← Act 5, Scene 7]] | [[Act 5, Scene 9|Act 5, Scene 9 →]]

*Another part of the plains.*

*Enter Hector.*

**HECT.**
Most putrefied core, so fair without,
Thy goodly armor thus hath cost thy life.
Now is my day’s work done, I’ll take good breath.
Rest, sword, thou hast thy fill of blood and death.

*Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him.*

*Enter Achilles and Myrmidons.*

**ACHIL.**
Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set,
How ugly night comes breathing at his heels;
Even with the vail and dark’ning of the sun,
To close the day up, Hector’s life is done.

**HECT.**
I am unarm’d, forgo this vantage, Greek.

**ACHIL.**
Strike, fellows, strike, this is the man I seek.
*(Hector falls.)*
So, Ilion, fall thou next! Come, Troy, sink down!
Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
“Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain!”
*(Retreat.)*
Hark, a retire upon our Grecian part.

**MYR.**
The Troyans’ trumpet sound the like, my lord.

**ACHIL.**
The dragon wing of night o’erspreads the earth,
And stickler-like the armies separates.
My half-supp’d sword that frankly would have fed,
Pleas’d with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
*(Sheathes his sword.)*
Come tie his body to my horse’s tail,
Along the field I will the Troyan trail.

*Exeunt.*
