## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Troy. A street.*

*Enter at one door Aeneas with a torch; at another, Paris, Deiphobus, Antenor, Diomedes the Grecian, and others with torches.*

**PAR.**
==1== See ho! Who is that there?

**DEI.**
==2== It is the Lord Aeneas.

**AENE.**
==3== Is the Prince there in person?
==4== Had I so good occasion to lie long
==5== As you, Prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
==6== Should rob my bed-mate of my company.

**DIO.**
==7== That’s my mind too. Good morrow, Lord Aeneas.

**PAR.**
==8== A valiant Greek, Aeneas, take his hand,
==9== Witness the process of your speech, wherein
==10== You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
==11== Did haunt you in the field.

**AENE.**
==11==               Health to you, valiant sir,
==12== During all question of the gentle truce;
==13== But when I meet you arm’d, as black defiance
==14== As heart can think or courage execute.

**DIO.**
==15== The one and other Diomed embraces.
==16== Our bloods are now in calm, and, so long, health!
==17== But when contention and occasion meet,
==18== By Jove I’ll play the hunter for thy life,
==19== With all my force, pursuit, and policy.

**AENE.**
==20== And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly
==21== With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
==22== Welcome to Troy! Now, by Anchises’ life,
==23== Welcome indeed! By Venus’ hand I swear,
==24== No man alive can love in such a sort
==25== The thing he means to kill, more excellently.

**DIO.**
==26== We sympathize. Jove, let Aeneas live,
==27== If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
==28== A thousand complete courses of the sun!
==29== But in mine emulous honor let him die,
==30== With every joint a wound, and that tomorrow!

**AENE.**
==31== We know each other well.

**DIO.**
==32== We do, and long to know each other worse.

**PAR.**
==33== This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
==34== The noblest hateful love, that e’er I heard of.
==35== What business, lord, so early?

**AENE.**
==36== I was sent for to the King, but why, I know not.

**PAR.**
==37== His purpose meets you; ’twas to bring this Greek
==38== To Calchas’ house, and there to render him,
==39== For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid.
==40== Let’s have your company, or if you please,
==41== Haste there before us. I constantly believe
==42== (Or rather call my thought a certain knowledge) 
==43== My brother Troilus lodges there tonight.
==44== Rouse him and give him note of our approach,
==45== With the whole quality wherefore. I fear
==46== We shall be much unwelcome.

**AENE.**
==46==                 That I assure you.
==47== Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
==48== Than Cressid borne from Troy.

**PAR.**
==48==                   There is no help.
==49== The bitter disposition of the time
==50== Will have it so. On, lord, we’ll follow you.

**AENE.**
==51== Good morrow, all.

*Exit.*

**PAR.**
==52== And tell me, noble Diomed—faith, tell me true,
==53== Even in soul of sound good-fellowship⁠—
==54== Who, in your thoughts, deserves fair Helen best,
==55== Myself, or Menelaus?

**DIO.**
==55==               Both alike.
==56== He merits well to have her that doth seek her,
==57== Not making any scruple of her soil,
==58== With such a hell of pain and world of charge;
==59== And you as well to keep her that defend her,
==60== Not palating the taste of her dishonor,
==61== With such a costly loss of wealth and friends.
==62== He like a puling cuckold would drink up
==63== The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
==64== You like a lecher out of whorish loins
==65== Are pleas’d to breed out your inheritors.
==66== Both merits pois’d, each weighs nor less nor more,
==67== But he as he, the heavier for a whore.

**PAR.**
==68== You are too bitter to your country-woman.

**DIO.**
==69== She’s bitter to her country. Hear me, Paris:
==70== For every false drop in her bawdy veins,
==71== A Grecian’s life hath sunk; for every scruple
==72== Of her contaminated carrion weight,
==73== A Troyan hath been slain. Since she could speak,
==74== She hath not given so many good words breath
==75== As for her Greeks and Troyans suff’red death.

**PAR.**
==76== Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
==77== Dispraise the thing that they desire to buy,
==78== But we in silence hold this virtue well,
==79== We’ll not commend what we intend to sell.
==80== Here lies our way.

*Exeunt.*
