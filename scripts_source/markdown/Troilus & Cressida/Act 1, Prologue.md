## Act 1, Prologue
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 1, Scene 1|Act 1, Scene 1 →]]

**PRO.**
==1==In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
==2==The princes orgulous, their high blood chaf’d,
==3==Have to the port of Athens sent their ships
==4==Fraught with the ministers and instruments
==5==Of cruel war. Sixty and nine, that wore
==6==Their crownets regal, from th’ Athenian bay
==7==Put forth toward Phrygia, and their vow is made
==8==To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures
==9==The ravish’d Helen, Menelaus’ queen,
==10==With wanton Paris sleeps—and that’s the quarrel.
==11==To Tenedos they come,
==12==And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
==13==Their warlike fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains
==14==The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
==15==Their brave pavilions. Priam’s six-gated city,
==16==Dardan and Timbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,
==17==And Antenorides, with massy staples
==18==And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts
==19==Sperr up the sons of Troy.
==20==Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,
==21==On one and other side, Troyan and Greek,
==22==Sets all on hazard—and hither am I come,
==23==A prologue arm’d, but not in confidence
==24==Of author’s pen or actor’s voice, but suited
==25==In like conditions as our argument,
==26==To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
==27==Leaps o’er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
==28==Beginning in the middle; starting thence away
==29==To what may be digested in a play.
==30==Like or find fault, do as your pleasures are,
==31==Now good or bad, ’tis but the chance of war.
