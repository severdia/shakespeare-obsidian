## Act 5, Scene 6
[[Act 5, Scene 5|← Act 5, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 7|Act 5, Scene 7 →]]

*Another part of the plains.*

*Enter Ajax.*

**AJAX.**
Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!

*Enter Diomedes.*

**DIO.**
Troilus, I say, where’s Troilus?

**AJAX.**
                What wouldst thou?

**DIO.**
I would correct him.

**AJAX.**
Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
Ere that correction. Troilus, I say, what, Troilus!

*Enter Troilus.*

**TRO.**
O traitor Diomed! Turn thy false face, thou traitor,
And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse.

**DIO.**
Ha, art thou there?

**AJAX.**
I’ll fight with him alone. Stand, Diomed.

**DIO.**
He is my prize, I will not look upon.

**TRO.**
Come both you cogging Greeks, have at you both!

*Exeunt fighting.*

*Enter Hector.*

**HECT.**
Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!

*Enter Achilles.*

**ACHIL.**
Now do I see thee, ha! Have at thee, Hector!

*They fight.*

**HECT.**
Pause if thou wilt.

**ACHIL.**
I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Troyan.
Be happy that my arms are out of use;
My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
Till when, go seek thy fortune.

*Exit.*

**HECT.**
                  Fare thee well.
I would have been much more a fresher man,
Had I expected thee. How now, my brother?

*Enter Troilus.*

**TRO.**
Ajax hath ta’en Aeneas! Shall it be?
No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
He shall not carry him; I’ll be ta’en too,
Or bring him off. Fate, hear me what I say!
I reck not though I end my life today.

*Exit.*

*Enter a Greek Knight in armor.*

**HECT.**
Stand, stand, thou Greek, thou art a goodly mark.
No? Wilt thou not? I like thy armor well;
I’ll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
But I’ll be master of it.
*(Exit Greek Knight.)*
           Wilt thou not, beast, abide?
Why then fly on, I’ll hunt thee for thy hide.

*Exit.*
