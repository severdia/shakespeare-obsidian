## Act 5, Scene 6
[[Act 5, Scene 5|← Act 5, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 7|Act 5, Scene 7 →]]

*Another part of the plains.*

*Enter Ajax.*

**AJAX.**
==1==Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!

*Enter Diomedes.*

**DIO.**
==2==Troilus, I say, where’s Troilus?

**AJAX.**
==2==                What wouldst thou?

**DIO.**
==3==I would correct him.

**AJAX.**
==4==Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
==5==Ere that correction. Troilus, I say, what, Troilus!

*Enter Troilus.*

**TRO.**
==6==O traitor Diomed! Turn thy false face, thou traitor,
==7==And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse.

**DIO.**
==8==Ha, art thou there?

**AJAX.**
==9==I’ll fight with him alone. Stand, Diomed.

**DIO.**
==10==He is my prize, I will not look upon.

**TRO.**
==11==Come both you cogging Greeks, have at you both!

*Exeunt fighting.*

*Enter Hector.*

**HECT.**
==12==Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!

*Enter Achilles.*

**ACHIL.**
==13==Now do I see thee, ha! Have at thee, Hector!

*They fight.*

**HECT.**
==14==Pause if thou wilt.

**ACHIL.**
==15==I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Troyan.
==16==Be happy that my arms are out of use;
==17==My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
==18==But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
==19==Till when, go seek thy fortune.

*Exit.*

**HECT.**
==19==                  Fare thee well.
==20==I would have been much more a fresher man,
==21==Had I expected thee. How now, my brother?

*Enter Troilus.*

**TRO.**
==22==Ajax hath ta’en Aeneas! Shall it be?
==23==No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
==24==He shall not carry him; I’ll be ta’en too,
==25==Or bring him off. Fate, hear me what I say!
==26==I reck not though I end my life today.

*Exit.*

*Enter a Greek Knight in armor.*

**HECT.**
==27==Stand, stand, thou Greek, thou art a goodly mark.
==28==No? Wilt thou not? I like thy armor well;
==29==I’ll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
==30==But I’ll be master of it.
*(Exit Greek Knight.)*
==30==           Wilt thou not, beast, abide?
==31==Why then fly on, I’ll hunt thee for thy hide.

*Exit.*
