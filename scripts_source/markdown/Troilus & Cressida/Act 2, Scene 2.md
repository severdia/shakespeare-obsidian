## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*Troy. A room in Priam’s palace.*

*Enter Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris, and Helenus.*

**PRI.**
==1==After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
==2==Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks;
==3==“Deliver Helen, and all damage else⁠—
==4==As honor, loss of time, travail, expense,
==5==Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum’d
==6==In hot digestion of this cormorant war⁠—
==7==Shall be struck off.” Hector, what say you to’t?

**HECT.**
==8==Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
==9==As far as toucheth my particular,
==10==Yet, dread Priam,
==11==There is no lady of more softer bowels,
==12==More spungy to suck in the sense of fear,
==13==More ready to cry out, “Who knows what follows?”
==14==Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,
==15==Surety secure, but modest doubt is call’d
==16==The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
==17==To th’ bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.
==18==Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
==19==Every tithe soul, ’mongst many thousand dismes,
==20==Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours.
==21==If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
==22==To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us
==23==(Had it our name) the value of one ten,
==24==What merit’s in that reason which denies
==25==The yielding of her up?

**TRO.**
==25==              Fie, fie, my brother!
==26==Weigh you the worth and honor of a king
==27==So great as our dread father’s in a scale
==28==Of common ounces? Will you with compters sum
==29==The past-proportion of his infinite,
==30==And buckle in a waist most fathomless
==31==With spans and inches so diminutive
==32==As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!

**HEL.**
==33==No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,
==34==You are so empty of them. Should not our father
==35==Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason,
==36==Because your speech hath none that tell him so?

**TRO.**
==37==You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest,
==38==You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:
==39==You know an enemy intends you harm;
==40==You know a sword employ’d is perilous,
==41==And reason flies the object of all harm.
==42==Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
==43==A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
==44==The very wings of reason to his heels
==45==And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
==46==Or like a star disorb’d? Nay, if we talk of reason,
==47==Let’s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honor
==48==Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts
==49==With this cramm’d reason; reason and respect
==50==Make livers pale and lustihood deject.

**HECT.**
==51==Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
==52==The keeping.

**TRO.**
==52==        What’s aught but as ’tis valued?

**HECT.**
==53==But value dwells not in particular will,
==54==It holds his estimate and dignity
==55==As well wherein ’tis precious of itself
==56==As in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry
==57==To make the service greater than the god,
==58==And the will dotes that is attributive
==59==To what infectiously itself affects,
==60==Without some image of th’ affected merit.

**TRO.**
==61==I take today a wife, and my election
==62==Is led on in the conduct of my will,
==63==My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
==64==Two traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores
==65==Of will and judgment: how may I avoid
==66==(Although my will distaste what it elected) 
==67==The wife I chose? There can be no evasion
==68==To blench from this and to stand firm by honor.
==69==We turn not back the silks upon the merchant
==70==When we have soil’d them, nor the remainder viands
==71==We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
==72==Because we now are full. It was thought meet
==73==Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks.
==74==Your breath with full consent bellied his sails;
==75==The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,
==76==And did him service; he touch’d the ports desir’d,
==77==And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
==78==He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
==79==Wrinkles Apollo’s, and makes pale the morning.
==80==Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.
==81==Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl,
==82==Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships,
==83==And turn’d crown’d kings to merchants.
==84==If you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom Paris went⁠—
==85==As you must needs, for you all cried “Go, go”⁠—
==86==If you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize⁠—
==87==As you must needs, for you all clapp’d your hands,
==88==And cried “Inestimable!”—why do you now
==89==The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
==90==And do a deed that never Fortune did,
==91==Beggar the estimation which you priz’d
==92==Richer than sea and land? O theft most base,
==93==That we have stol’n what we do fear to keep!
==94==But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n,
==95==That in their country did them that disgrace
==96==We fear to warrant in our native place!

**CAS.**
*(Within.)*
==97==Cry, Troyans, cry!

**PRI.**
==97==           What noise? What shrike is this?

**TRO.**
==98==’Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.

**CAS.**
*(Within.)*
==99==Cry, Troyans!

**HECT.**
==100==It is Cassandra.

*Enter Cassandra raving with her hair about her ears.*

**CAS.**
==101==Cry, Troyans, cry! Lend me ten thousand eyes,
==102==And I will fill them with prophetic tears.

**HECT.**
==103==Peace, sister, peace!

**CAS.**
==104==Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
==105==Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
==106==Add to my clamors! Let us pay betimes
==107==A moi’ty of that mass of moan to come.
==108==Cry, Troyans, cry! Practice your eyes with tears!
==109==Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand.
==110==Our fire-brand brother Paris burns us all.
==111==Cry, Troyans, cry! A Helen and a woe!
==112==Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.

*Exit.*

**HECT.**
==113==Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
==114==Of divination in our sister work
==115==Some touches of remorse? Or is your blood
==116==So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
==117==Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
==118==Can qualify the same?

**TRO.**
==118==           Why, brother Hector,
==119==We may not think the justness of each act
==120==Such and no other than event doth form it,
==121==Nor once deject the courage of our minds
==122==Because Cassandra’s mad. Her brain-sick raptures
==123==Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
==124==Which hath our several honors all engag’d
==125==To make it gracious. For my private part,
==126==I am no more touch’d than all Priam’s sons;
==127==And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
==128==Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
==129==To fight for and maintain.

**PAR.**
==130==Else might the world convince of levity
==131==As well my undertakings as your counsels,
==132==But I attest the gods, your full consent
==133==Gave wings to my propension, and cut off
==134==All fears attending on so dire a project.
==135==For what, alas, can these my single arms?
==136==What propugnation is in one man’s valor
==137==To stand the push and enmity of those
==138==This quarrel would excite? Yet I protest,
==139==Were I alone to pass the difficulties,
==140==And had as ample power as I have will,
==141==Paris should ne’er retract what he hath done,
==142==Nor faint in the pursuit.

**PRI.**
==142==              Paris, you speak
==143==Like one besotted on your sweet delights.
==144==You have the honey still, but these the gall;
==145==So to be valiant, is no praise at all.

**PAR.**
==146==Sir, I propose not merely to myself
==147==The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,
==148==But I would have the soil of her fair rape
==149==Wip’d off, in honorable keeping her.
==150==What treason were it to the ransack’d queen,
==151==Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,
==152==Now to deliver her possession up
==153==On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
==154==That so degenerate a strain as this
==155==Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
==156==There’s not the meanest spirit on our party
==157==Without a heart to dare, or sword to draw,
==158==When Helen is defended; nor none so noble
==159==Whose life were ill bestow’d, or death unfam’d,
==160==Where Helen is the subject. Then I say,
==161==Well may we fight for her whom we know well
==162==The world’s large spaces cannot parallel.

**HECT.**
==163==Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
==164==And on the cause and question now in hand
==165==Have gloz’d, but superficially, not much
==166==Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
==167==Unfit to hear moral philosophy.
==168==The reasons you allege do more conduce
==169==To the hot passion of distemp’red blood
==170==Than to make up a free determination
==171==’Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge
==172==Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
==173==Of any true decision. Nature craves
==174==All dues be rend’red to their owners: now,
==175==What nearer debt in all humanity
==176==Than wife is to the husband? If this law
==177==Of nature be corrupted through affection,
==178==And that great minds, of partial indulgence
==179==To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
==180==There is a law in each well-order’d nation
==181==To curb those raging appetites that are
==182==Most disobedient and refractory.
==183==If Helen then be wife to Sparta’s king,
==184==As it is known she is, these moral laws
==185==Of nature and of nations speak aloud
==186==To have her back return’d. Thus to persist
==187==In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
==188==But makes it much more heavy. Hector’s opinion
==189==Is this in way of truth; yet ne’er the less,
==190==My spritely brethren, I propend to you
==191==In resolution to keep Helen still,
==192==For ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
==193==Upon our joint and several dignities.

**TRO.**
==194==Why, there you touch’d the life of our design!
==195==Were it not glory that we more affected
==196==Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
==197==I would not wish a drop of Troyan blood
==198==Spent more in her defense. But, worthy Hector,
==199==She is a theme of honor and renown,
==200==A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
==201==Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
==202==And fame in time to come canonize us,
==203==For I presume brave Hector would not lose
==204==So rich advantage of a promis’d glory
==205==As smiles upon the forehead of this action
==206==For the wide world’s revenue.

**HECT.**
==206==                I am yours,
==207==You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
==208==I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
==209==The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks
==210==Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits.
==211==I was advertis’d their great general slept,
==212==Whilst emulation in the army crept:
==213==This I presume will wake him.

*Exeunt.*
