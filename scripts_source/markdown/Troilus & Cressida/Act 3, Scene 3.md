## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*The Grecian camp. Before Achilles’ tent.*

*Enter Ulysses, Diomedes, Nestor, Agamemnon, Ajax, Menelaus, and Calchas. Flourish.*

**CAL.**
==1==Now, princes, for the service I have done,
==2==Th’ advantage of the time prompts me aloud
==3==To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind,
==4==That through the sight I bear in things to come,
==5==I have abandon’d Troy, left my possession,
==6==Incurr’d a traitor’s name, expos’d myself
==7==From certain and possess’d conveniences
==8==To doubtful fortunes, sequest’ring from me all
==9==That time, acquaintance, custom, and condition
==10==Made tame and most familiar to my nature;
==11==And here, to do you service, am become
==12==As new into the world, strange, unacquainted.
==13==I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
==14==To give me now a little benefit
==15==Out of those many regist’red in promise,
==16==Which you say live to come in my behalf.

**AGAM.**
==17==What wouldst thou of us, Troyan? Make demand.

**CAL.**
==18==You have a Troyan prisoner call’d Antenor,
==19==Yesterday took; Troy holds him very dear.
==20==Oft have you (often have you thanks therefore) 
==21==Desir’d my Cressid in right great exchange,
==22==Whom Troy hath still denied, but this Antenor,
==23==I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
==24==That their negotiations all must slack,
==25==Wanting his manage, and they will almost
==26==Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
==27==In change of him. Let him be sent, great princes,
==28==And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
==29==Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
==30==In most accepted pain.

**AGAM.**
==31==Let Diomedes bear him,
==32==And bring us Cressid hither; Calchas shall have
==33==What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
==34==Furnish you fairly for this interchange;
==35==Withal bring word if Hector will tomorrow
==36==Be answered in his challenge: Ajax is ready.

**DIO.**
==37==This shall I undertake, and ’tis a burden
==38==Which I am proud to bear.

*Exit with Calchas.*

*Enter Achilles and Patroclus and stand in the door of their tent.*

**ULYSS.**
==39==Achilles stands i’ th’ entrance of his tent.
==40==Please it our general pass strangely by him,
==41==As if he were forgot, and, princes all,
==42==Lay negligent and loose regard upon him.
==43==I will come last; ’tis like he’ll question me
==44==Why such unplausive eyes are bent, why turn’d on him?
==45==If so, I have derision medicinable
==46==To use between your strangeness and his pride,
==47==Which his own will shall have desire to drink.
==48==It may do good, pride hath no other glass
==49==To show itself but pride; for supple knees
==50==Feed arrogance and are the proud man’s fees.

**AGAM.**
==51==We’ll execute your purpose, and put on
==52==A form of strangeness as we pass along.
==53==So do each lord, and either greet him not,
==54==Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
==55==Than if not look’d on. I will lead the way.

**ACHIL.**
==56==What comes the general to speak with me?
==57==You know my mind, I’ll fight no more ’gainst Troy.

**AGAM.**
==58==What says Achilles? Would he aught with us?

**NEST.**
==59==Would you, my lord, aught with the general?

**ACHIL.**
==60==No.

**NEST.**
==61==Nothing, my lord.

**AGAM.**
==62==The better.

*Exeunt Agamemnon and Nestor.*

**ACHIL.**
==63==Good day, good day.

**MEN.**
==64==How do you? How do you?

*Exit.*

**ACHIL.**
==65==What, does the cuckold scorn me?

**AJAX.**
==66==How now, Patroclus?

**ACHIL.**
==67==Good morrow, Ajax.

**AJAX.**
==68==Ha?

**ACHIL.**
==69==Good morrow.

**AJAX.**
==70==Ay, and good next day too.

*Exit.*

**ACHIL.**
==71==What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?

**PATR.**
==72==They pass by strangely. They were us’d to bend,
==73==To send their smiles before them to Achilles,
==74==To come as humbly as they us’d to creep
==75==To holy altars.

**ACHIL.**
==75==        What, am I poor of late?
==76==’Tis certain, greatness, once fall’n out with fortune,
==77==Must fall out with men too. What the declin’d is,
==78==He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
==79==As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
==80==Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
==81==And not a man, for being simply man,
==82==Hath any honor, but honor for those honors
==83==That are without him, as place, riches, and favor⁠—
==84==Prizes of accident as oft as merit,
==85==Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
==86==The love that lean’d on them as slippery too,
==87==Doth one pluck down another, and together
==88==Die in the fall. But ’tis not so with me,
==89==Fortune and I are friends. I do enjoy
==90==At ample point all that I did possess,
==91==Save these men’s looks, who do methinks find out
==92==Some thing not worth in me such rich beholding
==93==As they have often given. Here is Ulysses,
==94==I’ll interrupt his reading.
==95==How now, Ulysses?

**ULYSS.**
==95==           Now, great Thetis’ son!

**ACHIL.**
==96==What are you reading?

**ULYSS.**
==96==              A strange fellow here
==97==Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,
==98==How much in having, or without or in,
==99==Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
==100==Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
==101==As when his virtues, aiming upon others,
==102==Heat them, and they retort that heat again
==103==To the first giver.

**ACHIL.**
==103==           This is not strange, Ulysses.
==104==The beauty that is borne here in the face
==105==The bearer knows not, but commends itself
==106==To others’ eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
==107==That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
==108==Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed,
==109==Salutes each other with each other’s form;
==110==For speculation turns not to itself,
==111==Till it hath travel’d and is mirror’d there
==112==Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.

**ULYSS.**
==113==I do not strain at the position⁠—
==114==It is familiar—but at the author’s drift,
==115==Who in his circumstance expressly proves
==116==That no man is the lord of any thing,
==117==Though in and of him there be much consisting,
==118==Till he communicate his parts to others;
==119==Nor doth he of himself know them for aught,
==120==Till he behold them formed in th’ applause
==121==Where th’ are extended; who like an arch reverb’rate
==122==The voice again, or like a gate of steel,
==123==Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
==124==His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this,
==125==And apprehended here immediately
==126==Th’ unknown Ajax.
==127==Heavens, what a man is there! A very horse,
==128==That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
==129==Most abject in regard, and dear in use!
==130==What things again most dear in the esteem,
==131==And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow⁠—
==132==An act that very chance doth throw upon him⁠—
==133==Ajax renown’d! O heavens, what some men do,
==134==While some men leave to do!
==135==How some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,
==136==Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
==137==How one man eats into another’s pride,
==138==While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
==139==To see these Grecian lords!—why, even already
==140==They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
==141==As if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast,
==142==And great Troy shrieking.

**ACHIL.**
==143==I do believe it, for they pass’d by me
==144==As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
==145==Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?

**ULYSS.**
==146==Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
==147==Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
==148==A great-siz’d monster of ingratitudes.
==149==Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour’d
==150==As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
==151==As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,
==152==Keeps honor bright; to have done is to hang
==153==Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
==154==In monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way,
==155==For honor travels in a strait so narrow,
==156==Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,
==157==For emulation hath a thousand sons
==158==That one by one pursue. If you give way,
==159==Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
==160==Like to an ent’red tide, they all rush by
==161==And leave you hindmost;
==162==Or like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,
==163==Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
==164==O’errun and trampled on. Then what they do in present,
==165==Though less than yours in past, must o’ertop yours;
==166==For Time is like a fashionable host
==167==That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand,
==168==And with his arms outstretch’d as he would fly,
==169==Grasps in the comer. The welcome ever smiles,
==170==And farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek
==171==Remuneration for the thing it was;
==172==For beauty, wit,
==173==High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,
==174==Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
==175==To envious and calumniating Time.
==176==One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
==177==That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
==178==Though they are made and moulded of things past,
==179==And give to dust, that is a little gilt,
==180==More laud than gilt o’erdusted.
==181==The present eye praises the present object.
==182==Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
==183==That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
==184==Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
==185==Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,
==186==And still it might, and yet it may again,
==187==If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
==188==And case thy reputation in thy tent,
==189==Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late
==190==Made emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves,
==191==And drave great Mars to faction.

**ACHIL.**
==191==                  Of this my privacy
==192==I have strong reasons.

**ULYSS.**
==192==           But ’gainst your privacy
==193==The reasons are more potent and heroical.
==194==’Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
==195==With one of Priam’s daughters.

**ACHIL.**
==195==                  Ha? Known?

**ULYSS.**
==196==Is that a wonder?
==197==The providence that’s in a watchful state
==198==Knows almost every grain of Pluto’s gold,
==199==Finds bottom in th’ uncomprehensive depth,
==200==Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
==201==Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
==202==There is a mystery (with whom relation
==203==Durst never meddle) in the soul of state,
==204==Which hath an operation more divine
==205==Than breath or pen can give expressure to.
==206==All the commerce that you have had with Troy
==207==As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord,
==208==And better would it fit Achilles much
==209==To throw down Hector than Polyxena.
==210==But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
==211==When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
==212==And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
==213==“Great Hector’s sister did Achilles win,
==214==But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.”
==215==Farewell, my lord; I as your lover speak:
==216==The fool slides o’er the ice that you should break.

*Exit.*

**PATR.**
==217==To this effect, Achilles, have I mov’d you.
==218==A woman impudent and mannish grown
==219==Is not more loath’d than an effeminate man
==220==In time of action. I stand condemn’d for this;
==221==They think my little stomach to the war,
==222==And your great love to me, restrains you thus.
==223==Sweet, rouse yourself, and the weak wanton Cupid
==224==Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
==225==And like a dewdrop from the lion’s mane,
==226==Be shook to air.

**ACHIL.**
==226==        Shall Ajax fight with Hector?

**PATR.**
==227==Ay, and perhaps receive much honor by him.

**ACHIL.**
==228==I see my reputation is at stake,
==229==My fame is shrewdly gor’d.

**PATR.**
==229==                O then beware!
==230==Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves.
==231==Omission to do what is necessary
==232==Seals a commission to a blank of danger,
==233==And danger like an ague subtly taints
==234==Even then when they sit idly in the sun.

**ACHIL.**
==235==Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus.
==236==I’ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
==237==T’ invite the Troyan lords after the combat
==238==To see us here unarm’d. I have a woman’s longing,
==239==An appetite that I am sick withal,
==240==To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
==241==To talk with him, and to behold his visage,
==242==Even to my full of view.
*(Enter Thersites.)*
==242==              A labor sav’d!

**THER.**
==243==A wonder!

**ACHIL.**
==244==What?

**THER.**
==245==Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.

**ACHIL.**
==246==How so?

**THER.**
==247==He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector, and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.

**ACHIL.**
==248==How can that be?

**THER.**
==249==Why, ’a stalks up and down like a peacock—a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should say there were wit in this head and ’twould out—and so there is; but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking. The man’s undone forever, for if Hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat, he’ll break’t himself in vainglory. He knows not me. I said, “Good morrow, Ajax”; and he replies, “Thanks, Agamemnon.” What think you of this man that takes me for the general? He’s grown a very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin.

**ACHIL.**
==250==Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.

**THER.**
==251==Who, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody; he professes not answering. Speaking is for beggars; he wears his tongue in ’s arms. I will put on his presence, let Patroclus make demands to me; you shall see the pageant of Ajax.

**ACHIL.**
==252==To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarm’d to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honor’d captain-general of the army, Agamemnon, *et cetera*. Do this.

**PATR.**
==253==Jove bless great Ajax!

**THER.**
==254==Hum?

**PATR.**
==255==I come from the worthy Achilles⁠—

**THER.**
==256==Ha?

**PATR.**
==257==Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent⁠—

**THER.**
==258==Hum?

**PATR.**
==259==And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.

**THER.**
==260==Agamemnon?

**PATR.**
==261==Ay, my lord.

**THER.**
==262==Ha?

**PATR.**
==263==What say you to’t?

**THER.**
==264==God buy you, with all my heart.

**PATR.**
==265==Your answer, sir.

**THER.**
==266==If tomorrow be a fair day, by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other. Howsoever, he shall pay for me ere he has me.

**PATR.**
==267==Your answer, sir.

**THER.**
==268==Fare ye well, with all my heart.

**ACHIL.**
==269==Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?

**THER.**
==270==No; but he’s out of tune thus. What music will be in him when Hector has knock’d out his brains, I know not; but I am sure none, unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on.

**ACHIL.**
==271==Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.

**THER.**
==272==Let me bear another to his horse, for that’s the more capable creature.

**ACHIL.**
==273==My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr’d,
==274==And I myself see not the bottom of it.

*Exeunt Achilles and Patroclus.*

**THER.**
==275==Would the fountain of your mind were clear again, that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.

*Exit.*
