## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The Grecian camp. Before Calchas’s tent.*

*Enter Diomedes.*

**DIO.**
==1==What, are you up here, ho? Speak!

**CAL.**
*(Within.)*
==2==Who calls?

**DIO.**
==3==Diomed. Calchas, I think. Where’s your daughter?

**CAL.**
*(Within.)*
==4==She comes to you.

*Enter Troilus and Ulysses at a distance; after them, Thersites.*

**ULYSS.**
==5==Stand where the torch may not discover us.

*Enter Cressida.*

**TRO.**
==6==Cressid comes forth to him.

**DIO.**
==6==              How now, my charge?

**CRES.**
==7==Now, my sweet guardian, hark, a word with you.

*Whispers.*

**TRO.**
==8==Yea, so familiar?

**ULYSS.**
==9==She will sing any man at first sight.

**THER.**
==10==And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff; she’s noted.

**DIO.**
==11==Will you remember?

**CRES.**
==12==Remember? Yes.

**DIO.**
==13==Nay, but do then,
==14==And let your mind be coupled with your words.

**TRO.**
==15==What shall she remember?

**ULYSS.**
==16==List!

**CRES.**
==17==Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.

**THER.**
==18==Roguery!

**DIO.**
==19==Nay then⁠—

**CRES.**
==20==I’ll tell you what⁠—

**DIO.**
==21==Fo, fo, come, tell a pin. You are forsworn.

**CRES.**
==22==In faith, I cannot. What would you have me do?

**THER.**
==23==A juggling trick—to be secretly open.

**DIO.**
==24==What did you swear you would bestow on me?

**CRES.**
==25==I prithee do not hold me to mine oath,
==26==Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.

**DIO.**
==27==Good night.

**TRO.**
==28==Hold, patience.

**ULYSS.**
==29==How now, Troyan?

**CRES.**
==30==Diomed⁠—

**DIO.**
==31==No, no, good night, I’ll be your fool no more.

**TRO.**
==32==Thy better must.

**CRES.**
==33==Hark a word in your ear.

**TRO.**
==34==O plague and madness!

**ULYSS.**
==35==You are moved, Prince, let us depart, I pray,
==36==Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
==37==To wrathful terms. This place is dangerous,
==38==The time right deadly. I beseech you go.

**TRO.**
==39==Behold, I pray you.

**ULYSS.**
==39==           Now, good my lord, go off;
==40==You flow to great distraction. Come, my lord.

**TRO.**
==41==I prithee stay.

**ULYSS.**
==41==        You have not patience, come.

**TRO.**
==42==I pray you stay. By hell and all hell’s torments,
==43==I will not speak a word.

**DIO.**
==43==              And so good night.

**CRES.**
==44==Nay, but you part in anger.

**TRO.**
==44==              Doth that grieve thee?
==45==O withered truth!

**ULYSS.**
==45==           How now, my lord?

**TRO.**
==45==                       By Jove
==46==I will be patient.

**CRES.**
==46==           Guardian! Why, Greek!

**DIO.**
==47==Fo, fo, *adieu*, you palter.

**CRES.**
==48==In faith, I do not. Come hither once again.

**ULYSS.**
==49==You shake, my lord, at something; will you go?
==50==You will break out.

**TRO.**
==50==        She strokes his cheek.

**ULYSS.**
==50==                     Come, come.

**TRO.**
==51==Nay, stay; by Jove I will not speak a word.
==52==There is between my will and all offenses
==53==A guard of patience. Stay a little while.

**THER.**
==54==How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and potato finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!

**DIO.**
==55==But will you then?

**CRES.**
==56==In faith I will lo, never trust me else.

**DIO.**
==57==Give me some token for the surety of it.

**CRES.**
==58==I’ll fetch you one.

*Exit.*

**ULYSS.**
==59==You have sworn patience.

**TRO.**
==59==              Fear me not, my lord.
==60==I will not be myself, nor have cognition
==61==Of what I feel; I am all patience.

*Enter Cressida.*

**THER.**
==62==Now the pledge, now, now, now!

**CRES.**
==63==Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.

**TRO.**
==64==O beauty, where is thy faith?

**ULYSS.**
==64==                My lord⁠—

**TRO.**
==65==I will be patient, outwardly I will.

**CRES.**
==66==You look upon that sleeve, behold it well.
==67==He lov’d me—O false wench!—Give’t me again.

**DIO.**
==68==Whose was’t?

**CRES.**
==69==It is no matter now I ha’t again.
==70==I will not meet with you tomorrow night.
==71==I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.

**THER.**
==72==Now she sharpens. Well said, whetstone!

**DIO.**
==73==I shall have it.

**CRES.**
==73==        What, this?

**DIO.**
==73==                Ay, that.

**CRES.**
==74==O all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
==75==Thy master now lies thinking on his bed
==76==Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
==77==And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
==78==As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me.
==79==He that takes that doth take my heart withal.

**DIO.**
==80==I had your heart before, this follows it.

**TRO.**
==81==I did swear patience.

**CRES.**
==82==You shall not have it, Diomed, faith, you shall not.
==83==I’ll give you something else.

**DIO.**
==84==I will have this. Whose was it?

**CRES.**
==84==                  It is no matter.

**DIO.**
==85==Come, tell me whose it was.

**CRES.**
==86==’Twas one’s that lov’d me better than you will.
==87==But now you have it, take it.

**DIO.**
==87==                Whose was it?

**CRES.**
==88==By all Diana’s waiting-women yond,
==89==And by herself, I will not tell you whose.

**DIO.**
==90==Tomorrow will I wear it on my helm,
==91==And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.

**TRO.**
==92==Wert thou the devil, and wor’st it on thy horn,
==93==It should be challeng’d.

**CRES.**
==94==Well, well, ’tis done, ’tis past. And yet it is not;
==95==I will not keep my word.

**DIO.**
==95==              Why then farewell,
==96==Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.

**CRES.**
==97==You shall not go. One cannot speak a word
==98==But it straight starts you.

**DIO.**
==98==              I do not like this fooling.

**THER.**
==99==Nor I, by Pluto; but that that likes not you pleases me best.

**DIO.**
==100==What, shall I come? The hour⁠—

**CRES.**
==101==Ay, come—O Jove!—do come.—I shall be plagued.

**DIO.**
==102==Farewell till then.

**CRES.**
==102==           Good night. I prithee come.
*(Exit Diomedes.)*
==103==Troilus, farewell! One eye yet looks on thee,
==104==But with my heart the other eye doth see.
==105==Ah, poor our sex! This fault in us I find,
==106==The error of our eye directs our mind.
==107==What error leads must err; O then conclude,
==108==Minds sway’d by eyes are full of turpitude.

*Exit.*

**THER.**
==109==A proof of strength she could not publish more,
==110==Unless she said, “My mind is now turn’d whore.”

**ULYSS.**
==111==All’s done, my lord.

**TRO.**
==111==           It is.

**ULYSS.**
==111==                Why stay we then?

**TRO.**
==112==To make a recordation to my soul
==113==Of every syllable that here was spoke.
==114==But if I tell how these two did co-act,
==115==Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
==116==Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
==117==An esperance so obstinately strong,
==118==That doth invert th’ attest of eyes and ears,
==119==As if those organs had deceptious functions,
==120==Created only to calumniate.
==121==Was Cressid here?

**ULYSS.**
==121==           I cannot conjure, Troyan.

**TRO.**
==122==She was not, sure.

**ULYSS.**
==122==           Most sure she was.

**TRO.**
==123==Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.

**ULYSS.**
==124==Nor mine, my lord; Cressid was here but now.

**TRO.**
==125==Let it not be believ’d for womanhood!
==126==Think we had mothers, do not give advantage
==127==To stubborn critics, apt without a theme
==128==For depravation, to square the general sex
==129==By Cressid’s rule. Rather think this not Cressid.

**ULYSS.**
==130==What hath she done, Prince, that can soil our mothers?

**TRO.**
==131==Nothing at all, unless that this were she.

**THER.**
==132==Will ’a swagger himself out on ’s own eyes?

**TRO.**
==133==This she? No, this is Diomed’s Cressida.
==134==If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
==135==If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
==136==If sanctimony be the gods’ delight,
==137==If there be rule in unity itself,
==138==This was not she. O madness of discourse,
==139==That cause sets up with and against itself!
==140==Bi-fold authority, where reason can revolt
==141==Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
==142==Without revolt. This is, and is not, Cressid!
==143==Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
==144==Of this strange nature, that a thing inseparate
==145==Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
==146==And yet the spacious breadth of this division
==147==Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
==148==As Ariachne’s broken woof to enter.
==149==Instance, O instance, strong as Pluto’s gates,
==150==Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven;
==151==Instance, O instance, strong as heaven itself,
==152==The bonds of heaven are slipp’d, dissolv’d, and loos’d,
==153==And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
==154==The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
==155==The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
==156==Of her o’er-eaten faith, are given to Diomed.

**ULYSS.**
==157==May worthy Troilus be half attached
==158==With that which here his passion doth express?

**TRO.**
==159==Ay, Greek, and that shall be divulged well
==160==In characters as red as Mars his heart
==161==Inflam’d with Venus. Never did young man fancy
==162==With so eternal and so fix’d a soul.
==163==Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
==164==So much by weight hate I her Diomed.
==165==That sleeve is mine that he’ll bear on his helm.
==166==Were it a casque compos’d by Vulcan’s skill,
==167==My sword should bite it. Not the dreadful spout
==168==Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
==169==Constring’d in mass by the almighty sun,
==170==Shall dizzy with more clamor Neptune’s ear,
==171==In his descent, than shall my prompted sword
==172==Falling on Diomed.

**THER.**
==173==He’ll tickle it for his concupy.

**TRO.**
==174==O Cressid! O false Cressid! False, false, false!
==175==Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
==176==And they’ll seem glorious.

**ULYSS.**
==176==              O, contain yourself;
==177==Your passion draws ears hither.

*Enter Aeneas.*

**AENE.**
==178==I have been seeking you this hour, my lord.
==179==Hector by this is arming him in Troy;
==180==Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.

**TRO.**
==181==Have with you, Prince. My courteous lord, *adieu*.
==182==Farewell, revolted fair! And, Diomed,
==183==Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!

**ULYSS.**
==184==I’ll bring you to the gates.

**TRO.**
==185==Accept distracted thanks.

*Exeunt Troilus, Aeneas, and Ulysses.*

**THER.**
==186==Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would croak like a raven, I would bode, I would bode. Patroclus will give me any thing for the intelligence of this whore. The parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab. Lechery, lechery, still wars and lechery, nothing else holds fashion. A burning devil take them!

*Exit.*
