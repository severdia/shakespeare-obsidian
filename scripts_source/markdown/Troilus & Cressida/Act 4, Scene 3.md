## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 4, Scene 4|Act 4, Scene 4 →]]

*Troy. A street before Pandarus’s house.*

*Enter Paris, Troilus, Aeneas, Deiphobus, Antenor, Diomedes.*

**PAR.**
==1==It is great morning, and the hour prefix’d
==2==For her delivery to this valiant Greek
==3==Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
==4==Tell you the lady what she is to do,
==5==And haste her to the purpose.

**TRO.**
==5==                Walk into her house.
==6==I’ll bring her to the Grecian presently;
==7==And to his hand when I deliver her,
==8==Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
==9==A priest there off’ring to it his own heart.

*Exit.*

**PAR.**
==10==I know what ’tis to love,
==11==And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
==12==Please you walk in, my lords.

*Exeunt.*
