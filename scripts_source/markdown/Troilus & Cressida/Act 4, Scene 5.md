## Act 4, Scene 5
[[Act 4, Scene 4|← Act 4, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*The Grecian camp.*

*Enter Ajax armed, Achilles, Patroclus, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Ulysses, Nestor, Greek Trumpeter, etc.*

**AGAM.**
==1==Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
==2==Anticipating time. With starting courage,
==3==Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
==4==Thou dreadful Ajax, that the appalled air
==5==May pierce the head of the great combatant,
==6==And hale him hither.

**AJAX.**
==6==           Thou, trumpet, there’s my purse.
==7==Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe.
==8==Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
==9==Outswell the colic of puff’d Aquilon;
==10==Come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood;
==11==Thou blowest for Hector.

*Trumpet sounds.*

**ULYSS.**
==12==No trumpet answers.

**ACHIL.**
==12==           ’Tis but early days.

*Enter Diomedes and Cressida.*

**AGAM.**
==13==Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas’ daughter?

**ULYSS.**
==14==’Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait,
==15==He rises on the toe. That spirit of his
==16==In aspiration lifts him from the earth.

**AGAM.**
==17==Is this the Lady Cressid?

**DIO.**
==17==              Even she.

**AGAM.**
==18==Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.

*Kisses her.*

**NEST.**
==19==Our general doth salute you with a kiss.

**ULYSS.**
==20==Yet is the kindness but particular,
==21==’Twere better she were kiss’d in general.

**NEST.**
==22==And very courtly counsel. I’ll begin.
==23==So much for Nestor.

*Kisses her.*

**ACHIL.**
==24==I’ll take that winter from your lips, fair lady;
==25==Achilles bids you welcome.

*Kisses her.*

**MEN.**
==26==I had good argument for kissing once.

**PATR.**
==27==But that’s no argument for kissing now,
==28==For thus popp’d Paris in his hardiment,
==29==And parted thus you and your argument.

*Kisses her.*

**ULYSS.**
==30==O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns,
==31==For which we lose our heads to gild his horns!

**PATR.**
==32==The first was Menelaus’ kiss, this, mine;
==33==Patroclus kisses you.

*Kisses her again.*

**MEN.**
==33==           O, this is trim!

**PATR.**
==34==Paris and I kiss evermore for him.

**MEN.**
==35==I’ll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.

**CRES.**
==36==In kissing, do you render or receive?

**PATR.**
==37==Both take and give.

**CRES.**
==37==           I’ll make my match to live,
==38==The kiss you take is better than you give;
==39==Therefore no kiss.

**MEN.**
==40==I’ll give you boot, I’ll give you three for one.

**CRES.**
==41==You are an odd man, give even or give none.

**MEN.**
==42==An odd man, lady? Every man is odd.

**CRES.**
==43==No, Paris is not, for you know ’tis true
==44==That you are odd, and he is even with you.

**MEN.**
==45==You fillip me a’ th’ head.

**CRES.**
==45==              No, I’ll be sworn.

**ULYSS.**
==46==It were no match, your nail against his horn.
==47==May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?

**CRES.**
==48==You may.

**ULYSS.**
==48==        I do desire it.

**CRES.**
==48==                Why, beg then.

**ULYSS.**
==49==Why then for Venus’ sake, give me a kiss
==50==When Helen is a maid again and his.

**CRES.**
==51==I am your debtor, claim it when ’tis due.

**ULYSS.**
==52==Never’s my day, and then a kiss of you.

**DIO.**
==53==Lady, a word. I’ll bring you to your father.

*Exit with Cressida.*

**NEST.**
==54==A woman of quick sense.

**ULYSS.**
==54==              Fie, fie upon her!
==55==There’s language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
==56==Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
==57==At every joint and motive of her body.
==58==O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
==59==That give a coasting welcome ere it comes,
==60==And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
==61==To every ticklish reader! Set them down
==62==For sluttish spoils of opportunity,
==63==And daughters of the game.

*Flourish.*

**ALL.**
==64==The Troyans’ trumpet.

*Enter all of Troy: Hector armed, Paris, Aeneas, Helenus, Troilus, and Attendants.*

**AGAM.**
==64==              Yonder comes the troop.

**AENE.**
==65==Hail, all the state of Greece! What shall be done
==66==To him that victory commands? Or do you purpose
==67==A victor shall be known? Will you the knights
==68==Shall to the edge of all extremity
==69==Pursue each other, or shall they be divided
==70==By any voice or order of the field?
==71==Hector bade ask.

**AGAM.**
==71==        Which way would Hector have it?

**AENE.**
==72==He cares not, he’ll obey conditions.

**AGAM.**
==73==’Tis done like Hector.

**ACHIL.**
==73==           But securely done,
==74==A little proudly, and great deal misprising
==75==The knight oppos’d.

**AENE.**
==75==           If not Achilles, sir,
==76==What is your name?

**ACHIL.**
==76==           If not Achilles, nothing.

**AENE.**
==77==Therefore Achilles, but what e’er, know this:
==78==In the extremity of great and little,
==79==Valor and pride excel themselves in Hector,
==80==The one almost as infinite as all,
==81==The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
==82==And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
==83==This Ajax is half made of Hector’s blood,
==84==In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
==85==Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
==86==This blended knight, half Troyan and half Greek.

**ACHIL.**
==87==A maiden battle then? O, I perceive you.

*Enter Diomedes.*

**AGAM.**
==88==Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
==89==Stand by our Ajax. As you and Lord Aeneas
==90==Consent upon the order of their fight,
==91==So be it, either to the uttermost,
==92==Or else a breath. The combatants being kin
==93==Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.

*Ajax and Hector enter the lists.*

**ULYSS.**
==94==They are oppos’d already.

**AGAM.**
==95==What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy?

**ULYSS.**
==96==The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
==97==Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
==98==Speaking in deeds, and deedless in his tongue,
==99==Not soon provok’d, nor being provok’d soon calm’d;
==100==His heart and hand both open and both free,
==101==For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows,
==102==Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
==103==Nor dignifies an impare thought with breath;
==104==Manly as Hector, but more dangerous,
==105==For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
==106==To tender objects, but he in heat of action
==107==Is more vindicative than jealous love.
==108==They call him Troilus, and on him erect
==109==A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
==110==Thus says Aeneas, one that knows the youth
==111==Even to his inches, and with private soul
==112==Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.

*Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight.*

**AGAM.**
==113==They are in action.

**NEST.**
==114==Now, Ajax, hold thine own!

**TRO.**
==114==              Hector, thou sleep’st,
==115==Awake thee!

**AGAM.**
==116==His blows are well dispos’d. There, Ajax!

*Trumpets cease.*

**DIO.**
==117==You must no more.

**AENE.**
==117==           Princes, enough, so please you.

**AJAX.**
==118==I am not warm yet, let us fight again.

**DIO.**
==119==As Hector pleases.

**HECT.**
==119==           Why then will I no more.
==120==Thou art, great lord, my father’s sister’s son,
==121==A cousin-german to great Priam’s seed;
==122==The obligation of our blood forbids
==123==A gory emulation ’twixt us twain.
==124==Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so
==125==That thou couldst say, “This hand is Grecian all,
==126==And this is Troyan; the sinews of this leg
==127==All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother’s blood
==128==Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
==129==Bounds in my father’s”: by Jove multipotent,
==130==Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
==131==Wherein my sword had not impressure made
==132==Of our rank feud; but the just gods gainsay
==133==That any drop thou borrow’dst from thy mother,
==134==My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
==135==Be drained! Let me embrace thee, Ajax.
==136==By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms!
==137==Hector would have them fall upon him thus.
==138==Cousin, all honor to thee!

**AJAX.**
==138==              I thank thee, Hector.
==139==Thou art too gentle and too free a man.
==140==I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
==141==A great addition earned in thy death.

**HECT.**
==142==Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
==143==On whose bright crest Fame with her loud’st Oyes
==144==Cries, “This is he,” could promise to himself
==145==A thought of added honor torn from Hector.

**AENE.**
==146==There is expectance here from both the sides,
==147==What further you will do.

**HECT.**
==147==              We’ll answer it:
==148==The issue is embracement. Ajax, farewell.

**AJAX.**
==149==If I might in entreaties find success,
==150==As seld I have the chance, I would desire
==151==My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.

**DIO.**
==152==’Tis Agamemnon’s wish, and great Achilles
==153==Doth long to see unarm’d the valiant Hector.

**HECT.**
==154==Aeneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
==155==And signify this loving interview
==156==To the expecters of our Troyan part;
==157==Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin.
==158==I will go eat with thee and see your knights.

*Agamemnon and the rest come forward.*

**AJAX.**
==159==Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.

**HECT.**
==160==The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
==161==But for Achilles, my own searching eyes
==162==Shall find him by his large and portly size.

**AGAM.**
==163==Worthy all arms! As welcome as to one
==164==That would be rid of such an enemy.
==165==But that’s no welcome. Understand more clear,
==166==What’s past and what’s to come is strew’d with husks
==167==And formless ruin of oblivion;
==168==But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
==169==Strain’d purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
==170==Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
==171==From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.

**HECT.**
==172==I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.

**AGAM.**
*(To Troilus.)*
==173==My well-fam’d lord of Troy, no less to you.

**MEN.**
==174==Let me confirm my princely brother’s greeting:
==175==You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.

**HECT.**
==176==Who must we answer?

**AENE.**
==176==           The noble Menelaus.

**HECT.**
==177==O, you, my lord? By Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
==178==Mock not that I affect th’ untraded oath,
==179==Your quondam wife swears still by Venus’ glove.
==180==She’s well, but bade me not commend her to you.

**MEN.**
==181==Name her not now, sir, she’s a deadly theme.

**HECT.**
==182==O, pardon, I offend.

**NEST.**
==183==I have, thou gallant Troyan, seen thee oft,
==184==Laboring for destiny, make cruel way
==185==Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
==186==As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
==187==Despising many forfeits and subduements,
==188==When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i’ th’ air,
==189==Not letting it decline on the declined,
==190==That I have said to some my standers-by
==191==“Lo Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!”
==192==And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
==193==When that a ring of Greeks have hemm’d thee in,
==194==Like an Olympian wrestling. This have I seen,
==195==But this thy countenance, still lock’d in steel,
==196==I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
==197==And once fought with him. He was a soldier good,
==198==But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
==199==Never like thee. O, let an old man embrace thee,
==200==And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.

**AENE.**
==201==’Tis the old Nestor.

**HECT.**
==202==Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
==203==That hast so long walk’d hand in hand with time.
==204==Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.

**NEST.**
==205==I would my arms could match thee in contention,
==206==As they contend with thee in courtesy.

**HECT.**
==207==I would they could.

**NEST.**
==208==Ha!
==209==By this white beard, I’d fight with thee tomorrow.
==210==Well, welcome, welcome!—I have seen the time.

**ULYSS.**
==211==I wonder now how yonder city stands
==212==When we have here her base and pillar by us.

**HECT.**
==213==I know your favor, Lord Ulysses, well.
==214==Ah, sir, there’s many a Greek and Troyan dead
==215==Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
==216==In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.

**ULYSS.**
==217==Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue.
==218==My prophecy is but half his journey yet,
==219==For yonder walls that pertly front your town,
==220==Yon towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
==221==Must kiss their own feet.

**HECT.**
==221==              I must not believe you.
==222==There they stand yet, and modestly I think
==223==The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
==224==A drop of Grecian blood. The end crowns all,
==225==And that old common arbitrator, Time,
==226==Will one day end it.

**ULYSS.**
==226==           So to him we leave it.
==227==Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome!
==228==After the general, I beseech you next
==229==To feast with me and see me at my tent.

**ACHIL.**
==230==I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
==231==Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
==232==I have with exact view perus’d thee, Hector,
==233==And quoted joint by joint.

**HECT.**
==233==              Is this Achilles?

**ACHIL.**
==234==I am Achilles.

**HECT.**
==235==Stand fair, I pray thee, let me look on thee.

**ACHIL.**
==236==Behold thy fill.

**HECT.**
==236==        Nay, I have done already.

**ACHIL.**
==237==Thou art too brief. I will the second time,
==238==As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.

**HECT.**
==239==O, like a book of sport thou’lt read me o’er;
==240==But there’s more in me than thou understand’st.
==241==Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?

**ACHIL.**
==242==Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
==243==Shall I destroy him—whether there, or there, or there?⁠—
==244==That I may give the local wound a name,
==245==And make distinct the very breach whereout
==246==Hector’s great spirit flew. Answer me, heavens!

**HECT.**
==247==It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
==248==To answer such a question. Stand again.
==249==Think’st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
==250==As to prenominate in nice conjecture
==251==Where thou wilt hit me dead?

**ACHIL.**
==251==                I tell thee, yea.

**HECT.**
==252==Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
==253==I’d not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well,
==254==For I’ll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there,
==255==But by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
==256==I’ll kill thee every where, yea, o’er and o’er.
==257==You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag.
==258==His insolence draws folly from my lips,
==259==But I’ll endeavor deeds to match these words,
==260==Or may I never⁠—

**AJAX.**
==260==        Do not chafe thee, cousin,
==261==And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
==262==Till accident or purpose bring you to’t.
==263==You may have every day enough of Hector,
==264==If you have stomach. The general state, I fear,
==265==Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.

**HECT.**
==266==I pray you let us see you in the field;
==267==We have had pelting wars since you refus’d
==268==The Grecians’ cause.

**ACHIL.**
==268==           Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
==269==Tomorrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
==270==Tonight all friends.

**HECT.**
==270==           Thy hand upon that match.

**AGAM.**
==271==First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
==272==There in the full convive we. Afterwards,
==273==As Hector’s leisure and your bounties shall
==274==Concur together, severally entreat him.
==275==Beat loud the taborins, let the trumpets blow,
==276==That this great soldier may his welcome know.

*Exeunt all but Troilus and Ulysses.*

**TRO.**
==277==My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
==278==In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?

**ULYSS.**
==279==At Menelaus’ tent, most princely Troilus.
==280==There Diomed doth feast with him tonight,
==281==Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
==282==But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
==283==On the fair Cressid.

**TRO.**
==284==Shall I, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
==285==After we part from Agamemnon’s tent,
==286==To bring me thither?

**ULYSS.**
==286==           You shall command me, sir.
==287==But gentle tell me, of what honor was
==288==This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
==289==That wails her absence?

**TRO.**
==290==O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
==291==A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
==292==She was belov’d, she lov’d; she is, and doth:
==293==But still sweet love is food for fortune’s tooth.

*Exeunt.*
