## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon’s tent.*

*Sennet. Enter Agamemnon, Nestor, Ulysses, Diomedes, Menelaus, with others.*

**AGAM.**
==1==Princes:
==2==What grief hath set these jaundies o’er your cheeks?
==3==The ample proposition that hope makes
==4==In all designs begun on earth below
==5==Fails in the promis’d largeness. Checks and disasters
==6==Grow in the veins of actions highest rear’d,
==7==As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
==8==Infects the sound pine, and diverts his grain
==9==Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
==10==Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
==11==That we come short of our suppose so far
==12==That after seven years’ siege yet Troy walls stand,
==13==Sith every action that hath gone before,
==14==Whereof we have record, trial did draw
==15==Bias and thwart, not answering the aim
==16==And that unbodied figure of the thought
==17==That gave’t surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
==18==Do you with cheeks abash’d behold our works,
==19==And call them shames which are indeed nought else
==20==But the protractive trials of great Jove
==21==To find persistive constancy in men?
==22==The fineness of which metal is not found
==23==In fortune’s love; for then the bold and coward,
==24==The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
==25==The hard and soft, seem all affin’d and kin;
==26==But in the wind and tempest of her frown,
==27==Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
==28==Puffing at all, winnows the light away,
==29==And what hath mass or matter, by itself
==30==Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.

**NEST.**
==31==With due observance of thy godlike seat,
==32==Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
==33==Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
==34==Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
==35==How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
==36==Upon her patient breast, making their way
==37==With those of nobler bulk!
==38==But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
==39==The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
==40==The strong-ribb’d bark through liquid mountains cut,
==41==Bounding between the two moist elements,
==42==Like Perseus’ horse. Where’s then the saucy boat
==43==Whose weak untimber’d sides but even now
==44==Corrivall’d greatness? Either to harbor fled,
==45==Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
==46==Doth valor’s show and valor’s worth divide
==47==In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
==48==The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
==49==Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
==50==Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
==51==And flies fled under shade, why then the thing of courage,
==52==As rous’d with rage, with rage doth sympathize,
==53==And with an accent tun’d in self-same key
==54==Retires to chiding fortune.

**ULYSS.**
==54==              Agamemnon,
==55==Thou great commander, nerves and bone of Greece,
==56==Heart of our numbers, soul and only sprite
==57==In whom the tempers and the minds of all
==58==Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
==59==Besides th’ applause and approbation
==60==The which,
*(To Agamemnon.)*
==60==        most mighty for thy place and sway,
*(To Nestor.)*
==61==And thou most reverend for thy stretch’d-out life,
==62==I give to both your speeches, which were such
==63==As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
==64==Should hold up high in brass, and such again
==65==As venerable Nestor, hatch’d in silver,
==66==Should with a bond of air strong as the axle-tree
==67==On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
==68==To his experienc’d tongue, yet let it please both,
==69==Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.

**AGAM.**
==70==Speak, prince of Ithaca, and be’t of less expect
==71==That matter needless, of importless burden,
==72==Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
==73==When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
==74==We shall hear music, wit, and oracle.

**ULYSS.**
==75==Troy, yet upon his bases, had been down,
==76==And the great Hector’s sword had lack’d a master,
==77==But for these instances:
==78==The specialty of rule hath been neglected,
==79==And look how many Grecian tents do stand
==80==Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
==81==When that the general is not like the hive
==82==To whom the foragers shall all repair,
==83==What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
==84==Th’ unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
==85==The heavens themselves, the planets, and this center
==86==Observe degree, priority, and place,
==87==Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
==88==Office, and custom, in all line of order;
==89==And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
==90==In noble eminence enthron’d and spher’d
==91==Amidst the other; whose med’cinable eye
==92==Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
==93==And posts like the commandment of a king,
==94==Sans check, to good and bad. But when the planets
==95==In evil mixture to disorder wander,
==96==What plagues and what portents, what mutiny!
==97==What raging of the sea, shaking of earth!
==98==Commotion in the winds, frights, changes, horrors
==99==Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
==100==The unity and married calm of states
==101==Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shak’d,
==102==Which is the ladder of all high designs,
==103==The enterprise is sick. How could communities,
==104==Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,
==105==Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
==106==The primogenity and due of birth,
==107==Prerogative of age, crowns, scepters, laurels,
==108==But by degree stand in authentic place?
==109==Take but degree away, untune that string,
==110==And hark what discord follows. Each thing meets
==111==In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
==112==Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,
==113==And make a sop of all this solid globe;
==114==Strength should be lord of imbecility,
==115==And the rude son should strike his father dead;
==116==Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong
==117==(Between whose endless jar justice resides) 
==118==Should lose their names, and so should justice too!
==119==Then every thing include itself in power,
==120==Power into will, will into appetite,
==121==And appetite, an universal wolf
==122==(So doubly seconded with will and power),
==123==Must make perforce an universal prey,
==124==And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
==125==This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
==126==Follows the choking,
==127==And this neglection of degree it is
==128==That by a pace goes backward with a purpose
==129==It hath to climb. The general’s disdain’d
==130==By him one step below, he by the next,
==131==That next by him beneath; so every step,
==132==Exampled by the first pace that is sick
==133==Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
==134==Of pale and bloodless emulation,
==135==And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
==136==Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
==137==Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.

**NEST.**
==138==Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover’d
==139==The fever whereof all our power is sick.

**AGAM.**
==140==The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
==141==What is the remedy?

**ULYSS.**
==142==The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
==143==The sinew and the forehand of our host,
==144==Having his ear full of his airy fame,
==145==Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
==146==Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus
==147==Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
==148==Breaks scurril jests,
==149==And with ridiculous and awkward action,
==150==Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
==151==He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
==152==Thy topless deputation he puts on,
==153==And like a strutting player, whose conceit
==154==Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
==155==To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
==156==’Twixt his stretch’d footing and the scaffoldage,
==157==Such to-be-pitied and o’er-wrested seeming
==158==He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,
==159==’Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquar’d,
==160==Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp’d
==161==Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
==162==The large Achilles, on his press’d bed lolling,
==163==From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,
==164==Cries, “Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right!
==165==Now play me Nestor, hem, and stroke thy beard,
==166==As he being dress’d to some oration.”
==167==That’s done, as near as the extremest ends
==168==Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;
==169==Yet god Achilles still cries, “Excellent!
==170==’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
==171==Arming to answer in a night alarm.”
==172==And then forsooth the faint defects of age
==173==Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
==174==And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,
==175==Shake in and out the rivet; and at this sport
==176==Sir Valor dies; cries, “O, enough, Patroclus,
==177==Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
==178==In pleasure of my spleen.” And in this fashion,
==179==All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
==180==Severals and generals of grace exact,
==181==Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
==182==Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
==183==Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
==184==As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.

**NEST.**
==185==And in the imitation of these twain⁠—
==186==Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
==187==With an imperial voice—many are infect.
==188==Ajax is grown self-will’d, and bears his head
==189==In such a rein, in full as proud a place
==190==As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him,
==191==Makes factious feasts, rails on our state of war,
==192==Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
==193==A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
==194==To match us in comparisons with dirt,
==195==To weaken or discredit our exposure,
==196==How rank soever rounded in with danger.

**ULYSS.**
==197==They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
==198==Count wisdom as no member of the war,
==199==Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
==200==But that of hand. The still and mental parts,
==201==That do contrive how many hands shall strike
==202==When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
==203==Of their observant toil the enemies’ weight⁠—
==204==Why, this hath not a finger’s dignity.
==205==They call this bed-work, mapp’ry, closet-war,
==206==So that the ram that batters down the wall,
==207==For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,
==208==They place before his hand that made the engine,
==209==Or those that with the fineness of their souls
==210==By reason guide his execution.

**NEST.**
==211==Let this be granted, and Achilles’ horse
==212==Makes many Thetis’ sons.

*Tucket.*

**AGAM.**
==213==What trumpet? Look, Menelaus.

**MEN.**
==214==From Troy.

*Enter Aeneas and Trojan Trumpeter.*

**AGAM.**
==215==What would you ’fore our tent?

**AENE.**
==216==Is this great Agamemnon’s tent, I pray you?

**AGAM.**
==217==Even this.

**AENE.**
==218==May one that is a herald and a prince
==219==Do a fair message to his kingly eyes?

**AGAM.**
==220==With surety stronger than Achilles’ arm,
==221==’Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
==222==Call Agamemnon head and general.

**AENE.**
==223==Fair leave and large security. How may
==224==A stranger to those most imperial looks
==225==Know them from eyes of other mortals?

**AGAM.**
==225==                       How?

**AENE.**
==226==Ay,
==227==I ask, that I might waken reverence,
==228==And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
==229==Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
==230==The youthful Phoebus.
==231==Which is that god in office, guiding men?
==232==Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?

**AGAM.**
==233==This Troyan scorns us, or the men of Troy
==234==Are ceremonious courtiers.

**AENE.**
==235==Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm’d,
==236==As bending angels; that’s their fame in peace.
==237==But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
==238==Good arms, strong joints, true swords, and, great Jove’s accord,
==239==Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas,
==240==Peace, Troyan, lay thy finger on thy lips!
==241==The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
==242==If that the prais’d himself bring the praise forth;
==243==But what the repining enemy commends,
==244==That breath fame blows, that praise, sole pure, transcends.

**AGAM.**
==245==Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself Aeneas?

**AENE.**
==246==Ay, Greek, that is my name.

**AGAM.**
==247==What’s your affairs, I pray you?

**AENE.**
==248==Sir, pardon, ’tis for Agamemnon’s ears.

**AGAM.**
==249==He hears nought privately that comes from Troy.

**AENE.**
==250==Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him.
==251==I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
==252==To set his sense on the attentive bent,
==253==And then to speak.

**AGAM.**
==253==           Speak frankly as the wind,
==254==It is not Agamemnon’s sleeping hour.
==255==That thou shalt know, Troyan, he is awake,
==256==He tells thee so himself.

**AENE.**
==256==              Trumpet, blow loud,
==257==Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents,
==258==And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
==259==What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
*(Sound trumpet.)*
==260==We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
==261==A prince call’d Hector—Priam is his father⁠—
==262==Who in this dull and long-continued truce
==263==Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet,
==264==And to this purpose speak: kings, princes, lords!
==265==If there be one among the fair’st of Greece
==266==That holds his honor higher than his ease,
==267==And seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
==268==That knows his valor, and knows not his fear,
==269==That loves his mistress more than in confession
==270==With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
==271==And dare avow her beauty and her worth
==272==In other arms than hers—to him this challenge!
==273==Hector, in view of Troyans and of Greeks,
==274==Shall make it good, or do his best to do it:
==275==He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
==276==Than ever Greek did couple in his arms,
==277==And will tomorrow with his trumpet call,
==278==Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
==279==To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.
==280==If any come, Hector shall honor him;
==281==If none, he’ll say in Troy when he retires,
==282==The Grecian dames are sunburnt, and not worth
==283==The splinter of a lance. Even so much.

**AGAM.**
==284==This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.
==285==If none of them have soul in such a kind,
==286==We left them all at home. But we are soldiers,
==287==And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
==288==That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
==289==If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
==290==That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.

**NEST.**
==291==Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
==292==When Hector’s grandsire suck’d. He is old now,
==293==But if there be not in our Grecian mould
==294==A noble man that hath no spark of fire
==295==To answer for his love, tell him from me
==296==I’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,
==297==And in my vambrace put my withered brawns,
==298==And meeting him will tell him that my lady
==299==Was fairer than his grandam, and as chaste
==300==As may be in the world. His youth in flood,
==301==I’ll prove this troth with my three drops of blood.

**AENE.**
==302==Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth!

**ULYSS.**
==303==Amen.

**AGAM.**
==304==Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;
==305==To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir,
==306==Achilles shall have word of this intent,
==307==So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent.
==308==Yourself shall feast with us before you go,
==309==And find the welcome of a noble foe.

*Exeunt. Manent Ulysses and Nestor.*

**ULYSS.**
==310==Nestor!

**NEST.**
==311==What says Ulysses?

**ULYSS.**
==312==I have a young conception in my brain,
==313==Be you my time to bring it to some shape.

**NEST.**
==314==What is’t?

**ULYSS.**
==315==This ’tis:
==316==Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride
==317==That hath to this maturity blown up
==318==In rank Achilles must or now be cropp’d,
==319==Or shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
==320==To overbulk us all.

**NEST.**
==320==           Well, and how?

**ULYSS.**
==321==This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
==322==However it is spread in general name,
==323==Relates in purpose only to Achilles.

**NEST.**
==324==True, the purpose is perspicuous as substance,
==325==Whose grossness little characters sum up;
==326==And in the publication make no strain
==327==But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
==328==As banks of Libya (though, Apollo knows,
==329==’Tis dry enough), will with great speed of judgment,
==330==Ay, with celerity, find Hector’s purpose
==331==Pointing on him.

**ULYSS.**
==332==And wake him to the answer, think you?

**NEST.**
==333==Why, ’tis most meet; who may you else oppose
==334==That can from Hector bring those honors off,
==335==If not Achilles? Though’t be a sportful combat,
==336==Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
==337==For here the Troyans taste our dear’st repute
==338==With their fin’st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,
==339==Our imputation shall be oddly pois’d
==340==In this vild action, for the success,
==341==Although particular, shall give a scantling
==342==Of good or bad unto the general,
==343==And in such indexes (although small pricks
==344==To their subsequent volumes) there is seen
==345==The baby figure of the giant mass
==346==Of things to come at large. It is suppos’d
==347==He that meets Hector issues from our choice,
==348==And choice (being mutual act of all our souls) 
==349==Makes merit her election, and doth boil
==350==(As ’twere from forth us all) a man distill’d
==351==Out of our virtues, who miscarrying,
==352==What heart receives from hence a conquering part
==353==To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
==354==Which entertain’d, limbs are his instruments,
==355==In no less working than are swords and bows
==356==Directive by the limbs.

**ULYSS.**
==356==              Give pardon to my speech:
==357==Therefore ’tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
==358==Let us like merchants first show foul wares,
==359==And think perchance they’ll sell; if not,
==360==The lustre of the better shall exceed
==361==By showing the worse first. Do not consent
==362==That ever Hector and Achilles meet,
==363==For both our honor and our shame in this
==364==Are dogg’d with two strange followers.

**NEST.**
==365==I see them not with my old eyes, what are they?

**ULYSS.**
==366==What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
==367==Were he not proud, we all should share with him.
==368==But he already is too insolent;
==369==And it were better parch in Afric sun
==370==Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
==371==Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foil’d,
==372==Why then we do our main opinion crush
==373==In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry,
==374==And by device let blockish Ajax draw
==375==The sort to fight with Hector; among ourselves
==376==Give him allowance for the better man,
==377==For that will physic the great Myrmidon,
==378==Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
==379==His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
==380==If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
==381==We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,
==382==Yet go we under our opinion still
==383==That we have better men. But hit or miss,
==384==Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes:
==385==Ajax employ’d plucks down Achilles’ plumes.

**NEST.**
==386==Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,
==387==And I will give a taste thereof forthwith
==388==To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.
==389==Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone
==390==Must tarre the mastiffs on, as ’twere a bone.

*Exeunt.*
