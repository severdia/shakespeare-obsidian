## Act 5, Scene 9
[[Act 5, Scene 8|← Act 5, Scene 8]] | [[Act 5, Scene 10|Act 5, Scene 10 →]]

*Another part of the plains.*

*Sound retreat. Shout. Enter Agamemnon, Ajax, Menelaus, Nestor, Diomedes, and the rest, marching.*

**AGAM.**
Hark, hark, what shout is this?

**NEST.**
Peace, drums!

**MYRMIDONS.**
*(Within.)*
Achilles! Achilles! Hector’s slain! Achilles!

**DIO.**
The bruit is, Hector’s slain, and by Achilles.

**AJAX.**
If it be so, yet bragless let it be,
Great Hector was as good a man as he.

**AGAM.**
March patiently along; let one be sent
To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
If in his death the gods have us befriended,
Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.

*Exeunt.*
