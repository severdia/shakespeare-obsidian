*Another part of the plains.*

*Sound retreat. Shout. Enter Agamemnon, Ajax, Menelaus, Nestor, Diomedes, and the rest, marching.*

**AGAM.**
==1==Hark, hark, what shout is this?

**NEST.**
==2==Peace, drums!

**MYRMIDONS.**
*(Within.)*
==3==Achilles! Achilles! Hector’s slain! Achilles!

**DIO.**
==4==The bruit is, Hector’s slain, and by Achilles.

**AJAX.**
==5==If it be so, yet bragless let it be,
==6==Great Hector was as good a man as he.

**AGAM.**
==7==March patiently along; let one be sent
==8==To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
==9==If in his death the gods have us befriended,
==10==Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.

*Exeunt.*
