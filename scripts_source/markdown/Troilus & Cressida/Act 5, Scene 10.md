## Act 5, Scene 10
[[Act 5, Scene 9|← Act 5, Scene 9]]

*Another part of the plains.*

*Enter Aeneas, Paris, Antenor, Deiphobus.*

**AENE.**
==1== Stand ho! Yet are we masters of the field.

*Enter Troilus.*

**TRO.**
==2== Never go home, here starve we out the night⁠—
==3== Hector is slain.

**ALL AENE., PAR., DEI., ANT.**
==3==         Hector! The gods forbid!

**TRO.**
==4== He’s dead, and at the murderer’s horse’s tail,
==5== In beastly sort, dragg’d through the shameful field.
==6== Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
==7== Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
==8== I say at once, let your brief plagues be mercy,
==9== And linger not our sure destructions on!

**AENE.**
==10== My lord, you do discomfort all the host.

**TRO.**
==11== You understand me not that tell me so.
==12== I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
==13== But dare all imminence that gods and men
==14== Address their dangers in. Hector is gone.
==15== Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
==16== Let him that will a screech owl aye be call’d
==17== Go in to Troy and say there, “Hector’s dead!”
==18== There is a word will Priam turn to stone,
==19== Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
==20== Cold statues of the youth, and in a word,
==21== Scare Troy out of itself. But march away.
==22== Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
==23== Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
==24== Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
==25== Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
==26== I’ll through and through you! And, thou great-siz’d coward,
==27== No space of earth shall sunder our two hates.
==28== I’ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
==29== That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy’s thoughts.
==30== Strike a free march. To Troy with comfort go;
==31== Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.

*Enter Pandarus.*

**PAN.**
==32== But hear you, hear you!

**TRO.**
==33== Hence, broker, lackey!
*(Strikes him.)*
==33==               Ignominy, shame
==34== Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!

*Exeunt all but Pandarus.*

**PAN.**
==35== A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world, world, world! Thus is the poor agent despis’d! O traders and bawds, how earnestly are you set a-work, and how ill requited! Why should our endeavor be so lov’d and the performance so loath’d? What verse for it? What instance for it? Let me see:
==36== *Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,*
==37== *Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;*
==38== *And being once subdu’d in armed tail,*
==39== *Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.*
==40== Good traders in the flesh, set this in your painted cloths:
==41== *As many as be here of Pandar’s hall,*
==42== *Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar’s fall;*
==43== *Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,*
==44== *Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.*
==45== *Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,*
==46== *Some two months hence my will shall here be made.*
==47== *It should be now, but that my fear is this,*
==48== *Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss.*
==49== *Till then I’ll sweat and seek about for eases,*
==50== *And at that time bequeath you my diseases.*

*Exit.*
