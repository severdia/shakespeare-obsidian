## Act 5, Scene 7
[[Act 5, Scene 6|← Act 5, Scene 6]] | [[Act 5, Scene 8|Act 5, Scene 8 →]]

*Another part of the plains.*

*Enter Achilles with Myrmidons.*

**ACHIL.**
==1== Come here about me, you my Myrmidons,
==2== Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel;
==3== Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath,
==4== And when I have the bloody Hector found,
==5== Empale him with your weapons round about,
==6== In fellest manner execute your arms.
==7== Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye,
==8== It is decreed Hector the great must die.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Thersites; Menelaus and Paris fighting.*

**THER.**
==9== The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now, bull! Now, dog! ’Loo, Paris, ’loo! Now my double-henn’d Spartan! ’Loo, Paris, ’loo! The bull has the game, ware horns ho!

*Exeunt Paris and Menelaus.*

*Enter Bastard Margarelon.*

**MAR.**
==10== Turn, slave, and fight.

**THER.**
==11== What art thou?

**MAR.**
==12== A bastard son of Priam’s.

**THER.**
==13== I am a bastard too, I love bastards. I am bastard begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard in valor, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard? Take heed, the quarrel’s most ominous to us. If the son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment. Farewell, bastard.

*Exit.*

**MAR.**
==14== The devil take thee, coward!

*Exit.*
