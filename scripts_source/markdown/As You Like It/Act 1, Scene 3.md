## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*A room in the Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Celia and Rosalind.*

**CEL.**
==1== Why, cousin, why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy, not a word?

**ROS.**
==2== Not one to throw at a dog.

**CEL.**
==3== No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs, throw some of them at me. Come lame me with reasons.

**ROS.**
==4== Then there were two cousins laid up, when the one should be lam’d with reasons, and the other mad without any.

**CEL.**
==5== But is all this for your father?

**ROS.**
==6== No, some of it is for my child’s father. O how full of briers is this working-day world!

**CEL.**
==7== They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in holiday foolery; if we walk not in the trodden paths, our very petticoats will catch them.

**ROS.**
==8== I could shake them off my coat; these burs are in my heart.

**CEL.**
==9== Hem them away.

**ROS.**
==10== I would try, if I could cry “hem” and have him.

**CEL.**
==11== Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

**ROS.**
==12== O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!

**CEL.**
==13== O, a good wish upon you! You will try in time, in despite of a fall. But turning these jests out of service, let us talk in good earnest. Is it possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland’s youngest son?

**ROS.**
==14== The Duke my father lov’d his father dearly.

**CEL.**
==15== Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him, for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate not Orlando.

**ROS.**
==16== No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

**CEL.**
==17== Why should I not? Doth he not deserve well?

*Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.*

**ROS.**
==18== Let me love him for that, and do you love him because I do. Look, here comes the Duke.

**CEL.**
==19== With his eyes full of anger.

**DUKE F.**
==20== Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste,
==21== And get you from our court.

**ROS.**
==21==                 Me, uncle?

**DUKE F.**
==21==                   You, cousin.
==22== Within these ten days if that thou beest found
==23== So near our public court as twenty miles,
==24== Thou diest for it.

**ROS.**
==24==            I do beseech your Grace
==25== Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
==26== If with myself I hold intelligence,
==27== Or have acquaintance with mine own desires;
==28== If that I do not dream, or be not frantic
==29== (As I do trust I am not), then, dear uncle,
==30== Never so much as in a thought unborn
==31== Did I offend your Highness.

**DUKE F.**
==31==               Thus do all traitors:
==32== If their purgation did consist in words,
==33== They are as innocent as grace itself.
==34== Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.

**ROS.**
==35== Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.
==36== Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.

**DUKE F.**
==37== Thou art thy father’s daughter, there’s enough.

**ROS.**
==38== So was I when your Highness took his dukedom,
==39== So was I when your Highness banish’d him.
==40== Treason is not inherited, my lord,
==41== Or if we did derive it from our friends,
==42== What’s that to me? My father was no traitor.
==43== Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
==44== To think my poverty is treacherous.

**CEL.**
==45== Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

**DUKE F.**
==46== Ay, Celia, we stay’d her for your sake,
==47== Else had she with her father rang’d along.

**CEL.**
==48== I did not then entreat to have her stay,
==49== It was your pleasure and your own remorse.
==50== I was too young that time to value her,
==51== But now I know her. If she be a traitor,
==52== Why, so am I. We still have slept together,
==53== Rose at an instant, learn’d, play’d, eat together,
==54== And wheresoe’er we went, like Juno’s swans,
==55== Still we went coupled and inseparable.

**DUKE F.**
==56== She is too subtile for thee, and her smoothness,
==57== Her very silence, and her patience
==58== Speak to the people, and they pity her.
==59== Thou art a fool; she robs thee of thy name,
==60== And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
==61== When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
==62== Firm and irrevocable is my doom
==63== Which I have pass’d upon her; she is banish’d.

**CEL.**
==64== Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege,
==65== I cannot live out of her company.

**DUKE F.**
==66== You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself;
==67== If you outstay the time, upon mine honor,
==68== And in the greatness of my word, you die.

*Exit Duke with Lords.*

**CEL.**
==69== O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
==70== Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
==71== I charge thee be not thou more griev’d than I am.

**ROS.**
==72== I have more cause.

**CEL.**
==72==            Thou hast not, cousin,
==73== Prithee be cheerful. Know’st thou not the Duke
==74== Hath banish’d me, his daughter?

**ROS.**
==74==                   That he hath not.

**CEL.**
==75== No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
==76== Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one.
==77== Shall we be sund’red? Shall we part, sweet girl?
==78== No, let my father seek another heir.
==79== Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
==80== Whither to go, and what to bear with us,
==81== And do not seek to take your change upon you,
==82== To bear your griefs yourself, and leave me out;
==83== For by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
==84== Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.

**ROS.**
==85== Why, whither shall we go?

**CEL.**
==86== To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.

**ROS.**
==87== Alas, what danger will it be to us,
==88== Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
==89== Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

**CEL.**
==90== I’ll put myself in poor and mean attire,
==91== And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
==92== The like do you. So shall we pass along
==93== And never stir assailants.

**ROS.**
==93==               Were it not better,
==94== Because that I am more than common tall,
==95== That I did suit me all points like a man?
==96== A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
==97== A boar-spear in my hand, and—in my heart
==98== Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will⁠—
==99== We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside,
==100== As many other mannish cowards have
==101== That do outface it with their semblances.

**CEL.**
==102== What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

**ROS.**
==103== I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page,
==104== And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
==105== But what will you be call’d?

**CEL.**
==106== Something that hath a reference to my state:
==107== No longer Celia, but Aliena.

**ROS.**
==108== But, cousin, what if we assay’d to steal
==109== The clownish fool out of your father’s court?
==110== Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

**CEL.**
==111== He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me;
==112== Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away,
==113== And get our jewels and our wealth together,
==114== Devise the fittest time and safest way
==115== To hide us from pursuit that will be made
==116== After my flight. Now go we in content
==117== To liberty, and not to banishment.

*Exeunt.*
