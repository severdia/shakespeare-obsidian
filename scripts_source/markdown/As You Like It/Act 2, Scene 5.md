## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Amiens, Jaques, and others.*

*Song.*

**AMI.**
*Under the greenwood tree*
*Who loves to lie with me,*
*And turn his merry note*
*Unto the sweet bird’s throat,*
*Come hither, come hither, come hither!*
*Here shall he see*
*No enemy*
*But winter and rough weather.*

**JAQ.**
More, more, I prithee more.

**AMI.**
It will make you melancholy, *Monsieur* Jaques.

**JAQ.**
I thank it. More, I prithee more. I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee more.

**AMI.**
My voice is ragged, I know I cannot please you.

**JAQ.**
I do not desire you to please me, I do desire you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo. Call you ’em stanzos?

**AMI.**
What you will, *Monsieur* Jaques.

**JAQ.**
Nay, I care not for their names, they owe me nothing. Will you sing?

**AMI.**
More at your request than to please myself.

**JAQ.**
Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th’ encounter of two dog-apes; and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.

**AMI.**
Well, I’ll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look you.

**JAQ.**
And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come, warble, come.

**AMI.**
*(Song. All together here.)*
*Who doth ambition shun,*
*And loves to live i’ th’ sun,*
*Seeking the food he eats,*
*And pleas’d with what he gets,*
*Come hither, come hither, come hither!*
*Here shall he see*
*No enemy*
*But winter and rough weather.*

**JAQ.**
I’ll give you a verse to this note, that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.

**AMI.**
And I’ll sing it.

**JAQ.**
Thus it goes:
*If it do come to pass*
*That any man turn ass,*
*Leaving his wealth and ease*
*A stubborn will to please,*
*Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame!*
*Here shall he see*
*Gross fools as he,*
*And if he will come to me.*

**AMI.**
What’s that “ducdame”?

**JAQ.**
’Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I’ll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I’ll rail against all the first-born of Egypt.

**AMI.**
And I’ll go seek the Duke, his banquet is prepar’d.

*Exeunt.*
