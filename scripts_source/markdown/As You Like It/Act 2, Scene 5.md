## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Amiens, Jaques, and others.*

*Song.*

**AMI.**
==1== *Under the greenwood tree*
==2== *Who loves to lie with me,*
==3== *And turn his merry note*
==4== *Unto the sweet bird’s throat,*
==5== *Come hither, come hither, come hither!*
==6== *Here shall he see*
==7== *No enemy*
==8== *But winter and rough weather.*

**JAQ.**
==9== More, more, I prithee more.

**AMI.**
==10== It will make you melancholy, *Monsieur* Jaques.

**JAQ.**
==11== I thank it. More, I prithee more. I can suck melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs. More, I prithee more.

**AMI.**
==12== My voice is ragged, I know I cannot please you.

**JAQ.**
==13== I do not desire you to please me, I do desire you to sing. Come, more, another stanzo. Call you ’em stanzos?

**AMI.**
==14== What you will, *Monsieur* Jaques.

**JAQ.**
==15== Nay, I care not for their names, they owe me nothing. Will you sing?

**AMI.**
==16== More at your request than to please myself.

**JAQ.**
==17== Well then, if ever I thank any man, I’ll thank you; but that they call compliment is like th’ encounter of two dog-apes; and when a man thanks me heartily, methinks I have given him a penny, and he renders me the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will not, hold your tongues.

**AMI.**
==18== Well, I’ll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the Duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all this day to look you.

**JAQ.**
==19== And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is too disputable for my company. I think of as many matters as he, but I give heaven thanks, and make no boast of them. Come, warble, come.

**AMI.**
*(Song. All together here.)*
==20== *Who doth ambition shun,*
==21== *And loves to live i’ th’ sun,*
==22== *Seeking the food he eats,*
==23== *And pleas’d with what he gets,*
==24== *Come hither, come hither, come hither!*
==25== *Here shall he see*
==26== *No enemy*
==27== *But winter and rough weather.*

**JAQ.**
==28== I’ll give you a verse to this note, that I made yesterday in despite of my invention.

**AMI.**
==29== And I’ll sing it.

**JAQ.**
==30== Thus it goes:
==31== *If it do come to pass*
==32== *That any man turn ass,*
==33== *Leaving his wealth and ease*
==34== *A stubborn will to please,*
==35== *Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame!*
==36== *Here shall he see*
==37== *Gross fools as he,*
==38== *And if he will come to me.*

**AMI.**
==39== What’s that “ducdame”?

**JAQ.**
==40== ’Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a circle. I’ll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I’ll rail against all the first-born of Egypt.

**AMI.**
==41== And I’ll go seek the Duke, his banquet is prepar’d.

*Exeunt.*
