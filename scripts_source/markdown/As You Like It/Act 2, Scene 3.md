## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*Before Oliver’s house.*

*Enter Orlando and Adam, meeting.*

**ORL.**
==1==Who’s there?

**ADAM.**
==2==What, my young master? O my gentle master,
==3==O my sweet master, O you memory
==4==Of old Sir Rowland! Why, what make you here?
==5==Why are you virtuous? Why do people love you?
==6==And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?
==7==Why would you be so fond to overcome
==8==The bonny priser of the humorous Duke?
==9==Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
==10==Know you not, master, to some kind of men
==11==Their graces serve them but as enemies?
==12==No more do yours. Your virtues, gentle master,
==13==Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
==14==O, what a world is this, when what is comely
==15==Envenoms him that bears it!

**ORL.**
==16==Why, what’s the matter?

**ADAM.**
==16==              O unhappy youth,
==17==Come not within these doors! Within this roof
==18==The enemy of all your graces lives.
==19==Your brother—no, no brother, yet the son
==20==(Yet not the son, I will not call him son) 
==21==Of him I was about to call his father⁠—
==22==Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
==23==To burn the lodging where you use to lie,
==24==And you within it. If he fail of that,
==25==He will have other means to cut you off;
==26==I overheard him, and his practices.
==27==This is no place, this house is but a butchery;
==28==Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

**ORL.**
==29==Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?

**ADAM.**
==30==No matter whither, so you come not here.

**ORL.**
==31==What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
==32==Or with a base and boist’rous sword enforce
==33==A thievish living on the common road?
==34==This I must do, or know not what to do;
==35==Yet this I will not do, do how I can.
==36==I rather will subject me to the malice
==37==Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.

**ADAM.**
==38==But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
==39==The thrifty hire I sav’d under your father,
==40==Which I did store to be my foster-nurse,
==41==When service should in my old limbs lie lame,
==42==And unregarded age in corners thrown.
==43==Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
==44==Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
==45==Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold,
==46==All this I give you, let me be your servant.
==47==Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
==48==For in my youth I never did apply
==49==Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
==50==Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
==51==The means of weakness and debility;
==52==Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
==53==Frosty, but kindly. Let me go with you,
==54==I’ll do the service of a younger man
==55==In all your business and necessities.

**ORL.**
==56==O good old man, how well in thee appears
==57==The constant service of the antique world,
==58==When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
==59==Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
==60==Where none will sweat but for promotion,
==61==And having that do choke their service up
==62==Even with the having. It is not so with thee.
==63==But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree,
==64==That cannot so much as a blossom yield
==65==In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.
==66==But come thy ways, we’ll go along together,
==67==And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
==68==We’ll light upon some settled low content.

**ADAM.**
==69==Master, go on, and I will follow thee
==70==To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
==71==From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
==72==Here lived I, but now live here no more.
==73==At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,
==74==But at fourscore it is too late a week;
==75==Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
==76==Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.

*Exeunt.*
