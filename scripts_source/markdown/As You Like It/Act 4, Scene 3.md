## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Rosalind and Celia.*

**ROS.**
==1== How say you now? Is it not past two a’ clock? And here much Orlando!

**CEL.**
==2== I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth—to sleep. Look who comes here.

*Enter Silvius.*

**SIL.**
==3== My errand is to you, fair youth,
==4== My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
*(Gives a letter.)*
==5== I know not the contents, but as I guess
==6== By the stern brow and waspish action
==7== Which she did use as she was writing of it,
==8== It bears an angry tenure. Pardon me,
==9== I am but as a guiltless messenger.

**ROS.**
==10== Patience herself would startle at this letter,
==11== And play the swaggerer: bear this, bear all!
==12== She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
==13== She calls me proud, and that she could not love me
==14== Were man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will,
==15== Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
==16== Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
==17== This is a letter of your own device.

**SIL.**
==18== No, I protest, I know not the contents,
==19== Phebe did write it.

**ROS.**
==19==            Come, come, you are a fool,
==20== And turn’d into the extremity of love.
==21== I saw her hand, she has a leathern hand,
==22== A freestone-colored hand. I verily did think
==23== That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands;
==24== She has a huswive’s hand—but that’s no matter.
==25== I say she never did invent this letter,
==26== This is a man’s invention and his hand.

**SIL.**
==27== Sure it is hers.

**ROS.**
==28== Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,
==29== A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
==30== Like Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain
==31== Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
==32== Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect
==33== Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

**SIL.**
==34== So please you, for I never heard it yet;
==35== Yet heard too much of Phebe’s cruelty.

**ROS.**
==36== She Phebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.
*(Read.)*
==37== *“Art thou god to shepherd turn’d,*
==38== *That a maiden’s heart hath burn’d?”*
==39== Can a woman rail thus?

**SIL.**
==40== Call you this railing?

**ROS.**
*(Reads.)*
==41== *“Why, thy godhead laid apart,*
==42== *Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?”*
==43== *Did you ever hear such railing?*
==44== *“Whiles the eye of man did woo me,*
==45== *That could do no vengeance to me.”*
==46== *Meaning me a beast.*
==47== *“If the scorn of your bright eyne*
==48== *Have power to raise such love in mine,*
==49== *Alack, in me what strange effect*
==50== *Would they work in mild aspect?*
==51== *Whiles you chid me, I did love;*
==52== *How then might your prayers move?*
==53== *He that brings this love to thee*
==54== *Little knows this love in me;*
==55== *And by him seal up thy mind,*
==56== *Whether that thy youth and kind*
==57== *Will the faithful offer take*
==58== *Of me, and all that I can make,*
==59== *Or else by him my love deny,*
==60== *And then I’ll study how to die.”*

**SIL.**
==61== Call you this chiding?

**CEL.**
==62== Alas, poor shepherd!

**ROS.**
==63== Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false strains upon thee? Not to be endur’d! Well, go your way to her (for I see love hath made thee a tame snake) and say this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

*Exit Silvius*

*Enter Oliver.*

**OLIV.**
==64== Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you (if you know) 
==65== Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
==66== A sheep-cote fenc’d about with olive-trees?

**CEL.**
==67== West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom,
==68== The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
==69== Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
==70== But at this hour the house doth keep itself,
==71== There’s none within.

**OLIV.**
==72== If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
==73== Then should I know you by description⁠—
==74== Such garments and such years. “The boy is fair,
==75== Of female favor, and bestows himself
==76== Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
==77== And browner than her brother.” Are not you
==78== The owner of the house I did inquire for?

**CEL.**
==79== It is no boast, being ask’d, to say we are.

**OLIV.**
==80== Orlando doth commend him to you both,
==81== And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
==82== He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?

**ROS.**
==83== I am. What must we understand by this?

**OLIV.**
==84== Some of my shame, if you will know of me
==85== What man I am, and how, and why, and where
==86== This handkercher was stain’d.

**CEL.**
==86==                 I pray you tell it.

**OLIV.**
==87== When last the young Orlando parted from you
==88== He left a promise to return again
==89== Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
==90== Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
==91== Lo what befell! He threw his eye aside,
==92== And mark what object did present itself
==93== Under an old oak, whose boughs were moss’d with age
==94== And high top bald with dry antiquity:
==95== A wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,
==96== Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck
==97== A green and gilded snake had wreath’d itself,
==98== Who with her head nimble in threats approach’d
==99== The opening of his mouth; but suddenly
==100== Seeing Orlando, it unlink’d itself,
==101== And with indented glides did slip away
==102== Into a bush, under which bush’s shade
==103== A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
==104== Lay couching, head on ground, with cat-like watch
==105== When that the sleeping man should stir; for ’tis
==106== The royal disposition of that beast
==107== To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
==108== This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
==109== And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

**CEL.**
==110== O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,
==111== And he did render him the most unnatural
==112== That liv’d amongst men.

**OLIV.**
==112==               And well he might so do,
==113== For well I know he was unnatural.

**ROS.**
==114== But to Orlando: did he leave him there,
==115== Food to the suck’d and hungry lioness?

**OLIV.**
==116== Twice did he turn his back, and purpos’d so;
==117== But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
==118== And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
==119== Made him give battle to the lioness,
==120== Who quickly fell before him, in which hurtling
==121== From miserable slumber I awaked.

**CEL.**
==122== Are you his brother?

**ROS.**
==122==            Was’t you he rescu’d?

**CEL.**
==123== Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

**OLIV.**
==124== ’Twas I; but ’tis not I. I do not shame
==125== To tell you what I was, since my conversion
==126== So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

**ROS.**
==127== But for the bloody napkin?

**OLIV.**
==127==                 By and by.
==128== When from the first to last betwixt us two
==129== Tears our recountments had most kindly bath’d,
==130== As how I came into that desert place⁠—
==131== In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
==132== Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
==133== Committing me unto my brother’s love,
==134== Who led me instantly unto his cave,
==135== There stripp’d himself, and here upon his arm
==136== The lioness had torn some flesh away,
==137== Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
==138== And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.
==139== Brief, I recover’d him, bound up his wound,
==140== And after some small space, being strong at heart,
==141== He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
==142== To tell this story, that you might excuse
==143== His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
==144== Dy’d in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
==145== That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

*Rosalind faints.*

**CEL.**
==146== Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?

**OLIV.**
==147== Many will swoon when they do look on blood.

**CEL.**
==148== There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

**OLIV.**
==149== Look, he recovers.

**ROS.**
==150== I would I were at home.

**CEL.**
==150==               We’ll lead you thither.
==151== I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

**OLIV.**
==152== Be of good cheer, youth. You a man?
==153== You lack a man’s heart.

**ROS.**
==154== I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well counterfeited! I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!

**OLIV.**
==155== This was not counterfeit, there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.

**ROS.**
==156== Counterfeit, I assure you.

**OLIV.**
==157== Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.

**ROS.**
==158== So I do; but i’ faith, I should have been a woman by right.

**CEL.**
==159== Come, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.

**OLIV.**
==160== That will I, for I must bear answer back
==161== How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.

**ROS.**
==162== I shall devise something; but I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?

*Exeunt.*
