## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Rosalind and Celia.*

**ROS.**
==1==How say you now? Is it not past two o’clock? And here much Orlando!

**CEL.**
==2==I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he hath ta’en his bow and arrows and is gone forth—to sleep. Look who comes here.

*Enter Silvius.*

**SIL.**
==3==My errand is to you, fair youth,
==4==My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this.
*(Gives a letter.)*
==5==I know not the contents, but as I guess
==6==By the stern brow and waspish action
==7==Which she did use as she was writing of it,
==8==It bears an angry tenure. Pardon me,
==9==I am but as a guiltless messenger.

**ROS.**
==10==Patience herself would startle at this letter,
==11==And play the swaggerer: bear this, bear all!
==12==She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
==13==She calls me proud, and that she could not love me
==14==Were man as rare as phoenix. ’Od’s my will,
==15==Her love is not the hare that I do hunt;
==16==Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
==17==This is a letter of your own device.

**SIL.**
==18==No, I protest, I know not the contents,
==19==Phebe did write it.

**ROS.**
==19==           Come, come, you are a fool,
==20==And turn’d into the extremity of love.
==21==I saw her hand, she has a leathern hand,
==22==A freestone-colored hand. I verily did think
==23==That her old gloves were on, but ’twas her hands;
==24==She has a huswive’s hand—but that’s no matter.
==25==I say she never did invent this letter,
==26==This is a man’s invention and his hand.

**SIL.**
==27==Sure it is hers.

**ROS.**
==28==Why, ’tis a boisterous and a cruel style,
==29==A style for challengers. Why, she defies me,
==30==Like Turk to Christian. Women’s gentle brain
==31==Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention,
==32==Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect
==33==Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

**SIL.**
==34==So please you, for I never heard it yet;
==35==Yet heard too much of Phebe’s cruelty.

**ROS.**
==36==She Phebes me. Mark how the tyrant writes.
*(Read.)*
==37== *“Art thou god to shepherd turn’d,*
==38== *That a maiden’s heart hath burn’d?”*
==39==Can a woman rail thus?

**SIL.**
==40==Call you this railing?

**ROS.**
*(Reads.)*
==41==*“Why, thy godhead laid apart,*
==42==*Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?”*
==43==Did you ever hear such railing?
==44==*“Whiles the eye of man did woo me,*
==45==*That could do no vengeance to me.”*
==46==Meaning me a beast.
==47==*“If the scorn of your bright eyne*
==48==*Have power to raise such love in mine,*
==49==*Alack, in me what strange effect*
==50==*Would they work in mild aspect?*
==51==*Whiles you chid me, I did love;*
==52==*How then might your prayers move?*
==53==*He that brings this love to thee*
==54==*Little knows this love in me;*
==55==*And by him seal up thy mind,*
==56==*Whether that thy youth and kind*
==57==*Will the faithful offer take*
==58==*Of me, and all that I can make,*
==59==*Or else by him my love deny,*
==60==*And then I’ll study how to die.”*

**SIL.**
==61==Call you this chiding?

**CEL.**
==61==              Alas, poor shepherd!

**ROS.**
==62==Do you pity him? No, he deserves no pity. Wilt thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an instrument, and play false strains upon thee? Not to be endur’d! Well, go your way to her (for I see love hath made thee a tame snake) and say this to her: that if she love me, I charge her to love thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover, hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

*Exit Silvius*

*Enter Oliver.*

**OLIV.**
==63==Good morrow, fair ones. Pray you (if you know) 
==64==Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
==65==A sheep-cote fenc’d about with olive-trees?

**CEL.**
==66==West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom,
==67==The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
==68==Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
==69==But at this hour the house doth keep itself,
==70==There’s none within.

**OLIV.**
==71==If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
==72==Then should I know you by description⁠—
==73==Such garments and such years. “The boy is fair,
==74==Of female favor, and bestows himself
==75==Like a ripe sister; the woman low,
==76==And browner than her brother.” Are not you
==77==The owner of the house I did inquire for?

**CEL.**
==78==It is no boast, being ask’d, to say we are.

**OLIV.**
==79==Orlando doth commend him to you both,
==80==And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
==81==He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?

**ROS.**
==82==I am. What must we understand by this?

**OLIV.**
==83==Some of my shame, if you will know of me
==84==What man I am, and how, and why, and where
==85==This handkercher was stain’d.

**CEL.**
==85==                I pray you tell it.

**OLIV.**
==86==When last the young Orlando parted from you
==87==He left a promise to return again
==88==Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
==89==Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
==90==Lo what befell! He threw his eye aside,
==91==And mark what object did present itself
==92==Under an old oak, whose boughs were moss’d with age
==93==And high top bald with dry antiquity:
==94==A wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,
==95==Lay sleeping on his back; about his neck
==96==A green and gilded snake had wreath’d itself,
==97==Who with her head nimble in threats approach’d
==98==The opening of his mouth; but suddenly
==99==Seeing Orlando, it unlink’d itself,
==100==And with indented glides did slip away
==101==Into a bush, under which bush’s shade
==102==A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
==103==Lay couching, head on ground, with cat-like watch
==104==When that the sleeping man should stir; for ’tis
==105==The royal disposition of that beast
==106==To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
==107==This seen, Orlando did approach the man,
==108==And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

**CEL.**
==109==O, I have heard him speak of that same brother,
==110==And he did render him the most unnatural
==111==That liv’d amongst men.

**OLIV.**
==111==              And well he might so do,
==112==For well I know he was unnatural.

**ROS.**
==113==But to Orlando: did he leave him there,
==114==Food to the suck’d and hungry lioness?

**OLIV.**
==115==Twice did he turn his back, and purpos’d so;
==116==But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
==117==And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
==118==Made him give battle to the lioness,
==119==Who quickly fell before him, in which hurtling
==120==From miserable slumber I awaked.

**CEL.**
==121==Are you his brother?

**ROS.**
==121==           Was’t you he rescu’d?

**CEL.**
==122==Was’t you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

**OLIV.**
==123==’Twas I; but ’tis not I. I do not shame
==124==To tell you what I was, since my conversion
==125==So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

**ROS.**
==126==But for the bloody napkin?

**OLIV.**
==126==                By and by.
==127==When from the first to last betwixt us two
==128==Tears our recountments had most kindly bath’d,
==129==As how I came into that desert place⁠—
==130==In brief, he led me to the gentle Duke,
==131==Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
==132==Committing me unto my brother’s love,
==133==Who led me instantly unto his cave,
==134==There stripp’d himself, and here upon his arm
==135==The lioness had torn some flesh away,
==136==Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted,
==137==And cried in fainting upon Rosalind.
==138==Brief, I recover’d him, bound up his wound,
==139==And after some small space, being strong at heart,
==140==He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
==141==To tell this story, that you might excuse
==142==His broken promise, and to give this napkin,
==143==Dy’d in his blood, unto the shepherd youth
==144==That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

*Rosalind faints.*

**CEL.**
==145==Why, how now, Ganymede, sweet Ganymede?

**OLIV.**
==146==Many will swoon when they do look on blood.

**CEL.**
==147==There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

**OLIV.**
==148==Look, he recovers.

**ROS.**
==149==I would I were at home.

**CEL.**
==149==              We’ll lead you thither.
==150==I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

**OLIV.**
==151==Be of good cheer, youth. You a man?
==152==You lack a man’s heart.

**ROS.**
==153==I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would think this was well counterfeited! I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!

**OLIV.**
==154==This was not counterfeit, there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest.

**ROS.**
==155==Counterfeit, I assure you.

**OLIV.**
==156==Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.

**ROS.**
==157==So I do; but i’faith, I should have been a woman by right.

**CEL.**
==158==Come, you look paler and paler. Pray you draw homewards. Good sir, go with us.

**OLIV.**
==159==That will I, for I must bear answer back
==160==How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.

**ROS.**
==161==I shall devise something; but I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?

*Exeunt.*
