## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Clown (Touchstone) and Audrey.*

**TOUCH.**
Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey, tomorrow will we be married.

**AUD.**
I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come two of the banish’d Duke’s pages.

*Enter two Pages.*

**1. PAGE.**
Well met, honest gentleman.

**TOUCH.**
By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.

**2. PAGE.**
We are for you, sit i’ th’ middle.

**1. PAGE.**
Shall we clap into’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?

**2. PAGE.**
I’ faith, i’ faith, and both in a tune, like two gypsies on a horse.
*(Song.)*
*It was a lover and his lass,*
*With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,*
*That o’er the green corn-field did pass,*
*In spring time, the only pretty ring time,*
*When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding,*
*Sweet lovers love the spring.*
*Between the acres of the rye,*
*With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,*
*These pretty country folks would lie,*
*In spring time, etc.*
*This carol they began that hour,*
*With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,*
*How that a life was but a flower,*
*In spring time, etc.*
*And therefore take the present time,*
*With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,*
*For love is crowned with the prime,*
*In spring time, etc.*

**TOUCH.**
Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.

**1. PAGE.**
You are deceiv’d, sir, we kept time, we lost not our time.

**TOUCH.**
By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. God buy you, and God mend your voices! Come, Audrey.

*Exeunt.*
