## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Clown (Touchstone) and Audrey.*

**TOUCH.**
==1== Tomorrow is the joyful day, Audrey, tomorrow will we be married.

**AUD.**
==2== I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world. Here come two of the banish’d Duke’s pages.

*Enter two Pages.*

**1. PAGE.**
==3== Well met, honest gentleman.

**TOUCH.**
==4== By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.

**2. PAGE.**
==5== We are for you, sit i’ th’ middle.

**1. PAGE.**
==6== Shall we clap into’t roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?

**2. PAGE.**
==7== I’ faith, i’ faith, and both in a tune, like two gypsies on a horse.
*(Song.)*
==8== *It was a lover and his lass,*
==9== *With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,*
==10== *That o’er the green corn-field did pass,*
==11== *In spring time, the only pretty ring time,*
==12== *When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding,*
==13== *Sweet lovers love the spring.*
==14== *Between the acres of the rye,*
==15== *With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,*
==16== *These pretty country folks would lie,*
==17== *In spring time, etc.*
==18== *This carol they began that hour,*
==19== *With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,*
==20== *How that a life was but a flower,*
==21== *In spring time, etc.*
==22== *And therefore take the present time,*
==23== *With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,*
==24== *For love is crowned with the prime,*
==25== *In spring time, etc.*

**TOUCH.**
==26== Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the ditty, yet the note was very untuneable.

**1. PAGE.**
==27== You are deceiv’d, sir, we kept time, we lost not our time.

**TOUCH.**
==28== By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song. God buy you, and God mend your voices! Come, Audrey.

*Exeunt.*
