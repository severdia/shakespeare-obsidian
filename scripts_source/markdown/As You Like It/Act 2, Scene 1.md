## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*The Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, and two or three Lords, like foresters.*

**DUKE S.**
==1==Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
==2==Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
==3==Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
==4==More free from peril than the envious court?
==5==Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
==6==The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang
==7==And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,
==8==Which when it bites and blows upon my body
==9==Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say,
==10==“This is no flattery: these are counselors
==11==That feelingly persuade me what I am.”
==12==Sweet are the uses of adversity,
==13==Which like the toad, ugly and venomous,
==14==Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
==15==And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
==16==Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
==17==Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.

**AMI.**
==18==I would not change it. Happy is your Grace,
==19==That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
==20==Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

**DUKE S.**
==21==Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
==22==And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
==23==Being native burghers of this desert city,
==24==Should in their own confines with forked heads
==25==Have their round haunches gor’d.

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==25==                  Indeed, my lord,
==26==The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
==27==And in that kind swears you do more usurp
==28==Than doth your brother that hath banish’d you.
==29==Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
==30==Did steal behind him as he lay along
==31==Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out
==32==Upon the brook that brawls along this wood,
==33==To the which place a poor sequest’red stag,
==34==That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,
==35==Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,
==36==The wretched animal heav’d forth such groans
==37==That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
==38==Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
==39==Cours’d one another down his innocent nose
==40==In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
==41==Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
==42==Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,
==43==Augmenting it with tears.

**DUKE S.**
==43==              But what said Jaques?
==44==Did he not moralize this spectacle?

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==45==O yes, into a thousand similes.
==46==First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
==47==“Poor deer,” quoth he, “thou mak’st a testament
==48==As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
==49==To that which had too much.” Then being there alone,
==50==Left and abandoned of his velvet friends
==51==“’Tis right,” quoth he, “thus misery doth part
==52==The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,
==53==Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
==54==And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,
==55==“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,
==56==’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
==57==Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”
==58==Thus most invectively he pierceth through
==59==The body of the country, city, court,
==60==Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
==61==Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,
==62==To fright the animals and to kill them up
==63==In their assign’d and native dwelling-place.

**DUKE S.**
==64==And did you leave him in this contemplation?

**2. LORD. ARD.**
==65==We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
==66==Upon the sobbing deer.

**DUKE S.**
==66==              Show me the place.
==67==I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
==68==For then he’s full of matter.

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==69==I’ll bring you to him straight.

*Exeunt.*
