## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*The Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, and two or three Lords, like foresters.*

**DUKE S.**
==1== Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
==2== Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
==3== Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
==4== More free from peril than the envious court?
==5== Here feel we not the penalty of Adam,
==6== The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang
==7== And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind,
==8== Which when it bites and blows upon my body
==9== Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say,
==10== “This is no flattery: these are counsellors
==11== That feelingly persuade me what I am.”
==12== Sweet are the uses of adversity,
==13== Which like the toad, ugly and venomous,
==14== Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
==15== And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
==16== Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
==17== Sermons in stones, and good in every thing.

**AMI.**
==18== I would not change it. Happy is your Grace,
==19== That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
==20== Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

**DUKE S.**
==21== Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
==22== And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
==23== Being native burghers of this desert city,
==24== Should in their own confines with forked heads
==25== Have their round haunches gor’d.

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==26== Indeed, my lord,
==27== The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
==28== And in that kind swears you do more usurp
==29== Than doth your brother that hath banish’d you.
==30== Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
==31== Did steal behind him as he lay along
==32== Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out
==33== Upon the brook that brawls along this wood,
==34== To the which place a poor sequest’red stag,
==35== That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,
==36== Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,
==37== The wretched animal heav’d forth such groans
==38== That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
==39== Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
==40== Cours’d one another down his innocent nose
==41== In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,
==42== Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
==43== Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,
==44== Augmenting it with tears.

**DUKE S.**
==45== But what said Jaques?
==46== Did he not moralize this spectacle?

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==47== O yes, into a thousand similes.
==48== First, for his weeping into the needless stream:
==49== “Poor deer,” quoth he, “thou mak’st a testament
==50== As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
==51== To that which had too much.” Then being there alone,
==52== Left and abandoned of his velvet friends
==53== “’Tis right,” quoth he, “thus misery doth part
==54== The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,
==55== Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
==56== And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,
==57== “Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,
==58== ’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look
==59== Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”
==60== Thus most invectively he pierceth through
==61== The body of the country, city, court,
==62== Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
==63== Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,
==64== To fright the animals and to kill them up
==65== In their assign’d and native dwelling-place.

**DUKE S.**
==66== And did you leave him in this contemplation?

**2. LORD. ARD.**
==67== We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
==68== Upon the sobbing deer.

**DUKE S.**
==69== Show me the place.
==70== I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
==71== For then he’s full of matter.

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==72== I’ll bring you to him straight.

*Exeunt.*
