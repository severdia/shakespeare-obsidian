## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*The Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Rosalind as Ganymede, Celia as Aliena, and Clown, alias Touchstone.*

**ROS.**
==1==O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!

**TOUCH.**
==2==I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.

**ROS.**
==3==I could find in my heart to disgrace my man’s apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat; therefore courage, good Aliena.

**CEL.**
==4==I pray you bear with me, I cannot go no further.

**TOUCH.**
==5==For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear you. Yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you, for I think you have no money in your purse.

**ROS.**
==6==Well, this is the forest of Arden.

**TOUCH.**
==7==Ay, now am I in Arden, the more fool I. When I was at home, I was in a better place, but travelers must be content.

*Enter Corin and Silvius.*

**ROS.**
==8==Ay, be so, good Touchstone. Look you, who comes here, a young man and an old in solemn talk.

**COR.**
==9==That is the way to make her scorn you still.

**SIL.**
==10==O Corin, that thou knew’st how I do love her!

**COR.**
==11==I partly guess; for I have lov’d ere now.

**SIL.**
==12==No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
==13==Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
==14==As ever sigh’d upon a midnight pillow.
==15==But if thy love were ever like to mine⁠—
==16==As sure I think did never man love so⁠—
==17==How many actions most ridiculous
==18==Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

**COR.**
==19==Into a thousand that I have forgotten.

**SIL.**
==20==O, thou didst then never love so heartily!
==21==If thou rememb’rest not the slightest folly
==22==That ever love did make thee run into,
==23==Thou hast not lov’d;
==24==Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
==25==Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress’ praise,
==26==Thou hast not lov’d;
==27==Or if thou hast not broke from company
==28==Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
==29==Thou hast not lov’d.
==30==O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!

*Exit.*

**ROS.**
==31==Alas, poor shepherd, searching of thy wound,
==32==I have by hard adventure found mine own.

**TOUCH.**
==33==And I mine. I remember when I was in love, I broke my sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the kissing of her batler and the cow’s dugs that her pretty chopp’d hands had milk’d; and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods, and giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.

**ROS.**
==34==Thou speak’st wiser than thou art ware of.

**TOUCH.**
==35==Nay, I shall ne’er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it.

**ROS.**
==36==Jove, Jove! This shepherd’s passion
==37==Is much upon my fashion.

**TOUCH.**
==38==And mine, but it grows something stale with me.

**CEL.**
==39==I pray you, one of you question yond man,
==40==If he for gold will give us any food;
==41==I faint almost to death.

**TOUCH.**
==41==              Holla! You clown!

**ROS.**
==42==Peace, fool, he’s not thy kinsman.

**COR.**
==42==                  Who calls?

**TOUCH.**
==43==Your betters, sir.

**COR.**
==43==           Else are they very wretched.

**ROS.**
==44==Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.

**COR.**
==45==And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.

**ROS.**
==46==I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
==47==Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
==48==Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed.
==49==Here’s a young maid with travel much oppressed,
==50==And faints for succor.

**COR.**
==50==              Fair sir, I pity her,
==51==And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
==52==My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
==53==But I am shepherd to another man,
==54==And do not shear the fleeces that I graze.
==55==My master is of churlish disposition,
==56==And little reaks to find the way to heaven
==57==By doing deeds of hospitality.
==58==Besides, his cote, his flocks, and bounds of feed
==59==Are now on sale, and at our sheep-cote now
==60==By reason of his absence there is nothing
==61==That you will feed on; but what is, come see,
==62==And in my voice most welcome shall you be.

**ROS.**
==63==What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

**COR.**
==64==That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
==65==That little cares for buying any thing.

**ROS.**
==66==I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
==67==Buy thou the cottage, pasture, and the flock,
==68==And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.

**CEL.**
==69==And we will mend thy wages. I like this place,
==70==And willingly could waste my time in it.

**COR.**
==71==Assuredly the thing is to be sold.
==72==Go with me; if you like upon report
==73==The soil, the profit, and this kind of life,
==74==I will your very faithful feeder be,
==75==And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

*Exeunt.*
