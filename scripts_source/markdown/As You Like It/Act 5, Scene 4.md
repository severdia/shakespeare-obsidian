## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[ị Epilogue|Epilogue →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver, Celia.*

**DUKE S.**
==1== Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
==2== Can do all this that he hath promised?

**ORL.**
==3== I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not,
==4== As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.

*Enter Rosalind, Silvius, and Phebe.*

**ROS.**
==5== Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg’d:
==6== You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
==7== You will bestow her on Orlando here?

**DUKE S.**
==8== That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.

**ROS.**
==9== And you say you will have her, when I bring her.

**ORL.**
==10== That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.

**ROS.**
==11== You say you’ll marry me, if I be willing?

**PHE.**
==12== That will I, should I die the hour after.

**ROS.**
==13== But if you do refuse to marry me,
==14== You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

**PHE.**
==15== So is the bargain.

**ROS.**
==16== You say that you’ll have Phebe, if she will?

**SIL.**
==17== Though to have her and death were both one thing.

**ROS.**
==18== I have promis’d to make all this matter even:
==19== Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
==20== You, yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
==21== Keep you your word, Phebe, that you’ll marry me,
==22== Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
==23== Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her
==24== If she refuse me; and from hence I go
==25== To make these doubts all even.

*Exeunt Rosalind and Celia.*

**DUKE S.**
==26== I do remember in this shepherd boy
==27== Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.

**ORL.**
==28== My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
==29== Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
==30== But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
==31== And hath been tutor’d in the rudiments
==32== Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
==33== Whom he reports to be a great magician,
==34== Obscured in the circle of this forest.

*Enter Clown (Touchstone) and Audrey.*

**JAQ.**
==35== There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are call’d fools.

**TOUCH.**
==36== Salutation and greeting to you all!

**JAQ.**
==37== Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.

**TOUCH.**
==38== If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure, I have flatt’red a lady, I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy, I have undone three tailors, I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.

**JAQ.**
==39== And how was that ta’en up?

**TOUCH.**
==40== Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.

**JAQ.**
==41== How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.

**DUKE S.**
==42== I like him very well.

**TOUCH.**
==43== God ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favor’d thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.

**DUKE S.**
==44== By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.

**TOUCH.**
==45== According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.

**JAQ.**
==46== But for the seventh cause—how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?

**TOUCH.**
==47== Upon a lie seven times remov’d (bear your body more seeming, Audrey), as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is call’d the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself: this is call’d the Quip Modest. If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is call’d the Reply Churlish. If again, it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call’d the Reproof Valiant. If again, it was not well cut, he would say I lie: this is call’d the Countercheck Quarrelsome; and so to Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.

**JAQ.**
==48== And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

**TOUCH.**
==49== I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur’d swords and parted.

**JAQ.**
==50== Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

**TOUCH.**
==51== O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book—as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fift, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixt, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, “If you said so, then I said so”; and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.

**JAQ.**
==52== Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at any thing, and yet a fool.

**DUKE S.**
==53== He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

*Enter Hymen, Rosalind, and Celia. Still music.*

**HYM.**
==54== Then is there mirth in heaven,
==55== When earthly things made even
==55==     Atone together.
==56== Good Duke, receive thy daughter,
==57== Hymen from heaven brought her,
==57==     Yea, brought her hither,
==58== That thou mightst join her hand with his
==59== Whose heart within his bosom is.

**ROS.**
*(To Duke Senior.)*
==60== To you I give myself, for I am yours.
*(To Orlando.)*
==61== To you I give myself, for I am yours.

**DUKE S.**
==62== If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

**ORL.**
==63== If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.

**PHE.**
==64== If sight and shape be true,
==65== Why then my love *adieu*!

**ROS.**
==66== I’ll have no father, if you be not he;
==67== I’ll have no husband, if you be not he;
==68== Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not she.

**HYM.**
==69== Peace ho! I bar confusion,
==70== ’Tis I must make conclusion
==70==     Of these most strange events.
==71== Here’s eight that must take hands
==72== To join in Hymen’s bands,
==72==     If truth holds true contents.
*(To Orlando and Rosalind.)*
==73== You and you no cross shall part;
*(To Oliver and Celia.)*
==74== You and you are heart in heart;
*(To Phebe.)*
==75== You to his love must accord,
==76== Or have a woman to your lord;
*(To Touchstone and Audrey.)*
==77== You and you are sure together,
==78== As the winter to foul weather.⁠—
==79== Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
==80== Feed yourselves with questioning;
==81== That reason wonder may diminish
==82== How thus we met, and these things finish.
*(Song.)*
==83== *Wedding is great Juno’s crown,*
==84== *O blessed bond of board and bed!*
==85== *’Tis Hymen peoples every town,*
==86== *High wedlock then be honored.*
==87== *Honor, high honor, and renown*
==88== *To Hymen, god of every town!*

**DUKE S.**
==89== O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me,
==90== Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.

**PHE.**
==91== I will not eat my word, now thou art mine,
==92== Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.

*Enter Second Brother (Jaques De Boys).*

**JAQ. DE B.**
==93== Let me have audience for a word or two.
==94== I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
==95== That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
==96== Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
==97== Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
==98== Address’d a mighty power, which were on foot
==99== In his own conduct, purposely to take
==100== His brother here, and put him to the sword;
==101== And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
==102== Where, meeting with an old religious man,
==103== After some question with him, was converted
==104== Both from his enterprise and from the world,
==105== His crown bequeathing to his banish’d brother,
==106== And all their lands restor’d to them again
==107== That were with him exil’d. This to be true,
==108== I do engage my life.

**DUKE S.**
==109== Welcome, young man;
==110== Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers’ wedding:
==111== To one his lands withheld, and to the other
==112== A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
==113== First, in this forest let us do those ends
==114== That here were well begun and well begot;
==115== And after, every of this happy number,
==116== That have endur’d shrewd days and nights with us,
==117== Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
==118== According to the measure of their states.
==119== Mean time, forget this new-fall’n dignity,
==120== And fall into our rustic revelry.
==121== Play, music, and you brides and bridegrooms all,
==122== With measure heap’d in joy, to th’ measures fall.

**JAQ.**
==123== Sir, by your patience.—If I heard you rightly,
==124== The Duke hath put on a religious life,
==125== And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

**JAQ. DE B.**
==126== He hath.

**JAQ.**
==127== To him will I. Out of these convertites
==128== There is much matter to be heard and learn’d.
*(To Duke Senior.)*
==129== You to your former honor I bequeath,
==130== Your patience and your virtue well deserves it;
*(To Orlando.)*
==131== You to a love, that your true faith doth merit;
*(To Oliver.)*
==132== You to your land, and love, and great allies;
*(To Silvius.)*
==133== You to a long and well-deserved bed;
*(To Touchstone.)*
==134== And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage
==135== Is but for two months victuall’d.—So to your pleasures,
==136== I am for other than for dancing measures.

**DUKE S.**
==137== Stay, Jaques, stay.

**JAQ.**
==138== To see no pastime I. What you would have
==139== I’ll stay to know at your abandon’d cave.

*Exit.*

**DUKE S.**
==140== Proceed, proceed. We’ll begin these rites,
==141== As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.

*A dance.*

*Exeunt all but Rosalind.*
