## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Epilogue|Epilogue →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, Jaques, Orlando, Oliver, Celia.*

**DUKE S.**
==1==Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
==2==Can do all this that he hath promised?

**ORL.**
==3==I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not,
==4==As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.

*Enter Rosalind, Silvius, and Phebe.*

**ROS.**
==5==Patience once more, whiles our compact is urg’d:
==6==You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
==7==You will bestow her on Orlando here?

**DUKE S.**
==8==That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.

**ROS.**
==9==And you say you will have her, when I bring her.

**ORL.**
==10==That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.

**ROS.**
==11==You say you’ll marry me, if I be willing?

**PHE.**
==12==That will I, should I die the hour after.

**ROS.**
==13==But if you do refuse to marry me,
==14==You’ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

**PHE.**
==15==So is the bargain.

**ROS.**
==16==You say that you’ll have Phebe, if she will?

**SIL.**
==17==Though to have her and death were both one thing.

**ROS.**
==18==I have promis’d to make all this matter even:
==19==Keep you your word, O Duke, to give your daughter;
==20==You, yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter;
==21==Keep you your word, Phebe, that you’ll marry me,
==22==Or else, refusing me, to wed this shepherd;
==23==Keep your word, Silvius, that you’ll marry her
==24==If she refuse me; and from hence I go
==25==To make these doubts all even.

*Exeunt Rosalind and Celia.*

**DUKE S.**
==26==I do remember in this shepherd boy
==27==Some lively touches of my daughter’s favor.

**ORL.**
==28==My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
==29==Methought he was a brother to your daughter.
==30==But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
==31==And hath been tutor’d in the rudiments
==32==Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
==33==Whom he reports to be a great magician,
==34==Obscured in the circle of this forest.

*Enter Clown (Touchstone) and Audrey.*

**JAQ.**
==35==There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of very strange beasts, which in all tongues are call’d fools.

**TOUCH.**
==36==Salutation and greeting to you all!

**JAQ.**
==37==Good my lord, bid him welcome. This is the motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest. He hath been a courtier, he swears.

**TOUCH.**
==38==If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure, I have flatt’red a lady, I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy, I have undone three tailors, I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.

**JAQ.**
==39==And how was that ta’en up?

**TOUCH.**
==40==Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause.

**JAQ.**
==41==How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.

**DUKE S.**
==42==I like him very well.

**TOUCH.**
==43==God ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favor’d thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.

**DUKE S.**
==44==By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.

**TOUCH.**
==45==According to the fool’s bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.

**JAQ.**
==46==But for the seventh cause—how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?

**TOUCH.**
==47==Upon a lie seven times remov’d (bear your body more seeming, Audrey), as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is call’d the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself: this is call’d the Quip Modest. If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is call’d the Reply Churlish. If again, it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call’d the Reproof Valiant. If again, it was not well cut, he would say I lie: this is call’d the Countercheck Quarrelsome; and so to Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.

**JAQ.**
==48==And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

**TOUCH.**
==49==I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur’d swords and parted.

**JAQ.**
==50==Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

**TOUCH.**
==51==O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book—as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fift, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixt, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, “If you said so, then I said so”; and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.

**JAQ.**
==52==Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? He’s as good at any thing, and yet a fool.

**DUKE S.**
==53==He uses his folly like a stalking-horse, and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

*Enter Hymen, Rosalind, and Celia. Still music.*

**HYM.**
==54==*Then is there mirth in heaven,*
==55==*When earthly things made even*
==56==    *Atone together.*
==57==*Good Duke, receive thy daughter,*
==58==*Hymen from heaven brought her,*
==59==    *Yea, brought her hither,*
==60==*That thou mightst join her hand with his*
==61==*Whose heart within his bosom is.*

**ROS.**
*(To Duke Senior.)*
==62==To you I give myself, for I am yours.
*(To Orlando.)*
==63==To you I give myself, for I am yours.

**DUKE S.**
==64==If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

**ORL.**
==65==If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.

**PHE.**
==66==If sight and shape be true,
==67==Why then my love *adieu*!

**ROS.**
==68==I’ll have no father, if you be not he;
==69==I’ll have no husband, if you be not he;
==70==Nor ne’er wed woman, if you be not she.

**HYM.**
==71==Peace ho! I bar confusion,
==72==’Tis I must make conclusion
==72==    Of these most strange events.
==73==Here’s eight that must take hands
==74==To join in Hymen’s bands,
==74==    If truth holds true contents.
*(To Orlando and Rosalind.)*
==75==You and you no cross shall part;
*(To Oliver and Celia.)*
==76==You and you are heart in heart;
*(To Phebe.)*
==77==You to his love must accord,
==78==Or have a woman to your lord;
*(To Touchstone and Audrey.)*
==79==You and you are sure together,
==80==As the winter to foul weather.⁠—
==81==Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
==82==Feed yourselves with questioning;
==83==That reason wonder may diminish
==84==How thus we met, and these things finish.
*(Song.)*
==85== *Wedding is great Juno’s crown,*
==86==    *O blessed bond of board and bed!*
==87== *’Tis Hymen peoples every town,*
==88==    *High wedlock then be honored.*
==89== *Honor, high honor, and renown*
==90== *To Hymen, god of every town!*

**DUKE S.**
==91==O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me,
==92==Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.

**PHE.**
==93==I will not eat my word, now thou art mine,
==94==Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.

*Enter Second Brother (Jaques De Boys).*

**JAQ. DE B.**
==95==Let me have audience for a word or two.
==96==I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
==97==That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
==98==Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
==99==Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
==100==Address’d a mighty power, which were on foot
==101==In his own conduct, purposely to take
==102==His brother here, and put him to the sword;
==103==And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
==104==Where, meeting with an old religious man,
==105==After some question with him, was converted
==106==Both from his enterprise and from the world,
==107==His crown bequeathing to his banish’d brother,
==108==And all their lands restor’d to them again
==109==That were with him exil’d. This to be true,
==110==I do engage my life.

**DUKE S.**
==111==Welcome, young man;
==112==Thou offer’st fairly to thy brothers’ wedding:
==113==To one his lands withheld, and to the other
==114==A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
==115==First, in this forest let us do those ends
==116==That here were well begun and well begot;
==117==And after, every of this happy number,
==118==That have endur’d shrewd days and nights with us,
==119==Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
==120==According to the measure of their states.
==121==Mean time, forget this new-fall’n dignity,
==122==And fall into our rustic revelry.
==123==Play, music, and you brides and bridegrooms all,
==124==With measure heap’d in joy, to th’ measures fall.

**JAQ.**
==125==Sir, by your patience.—If I heard you rightly,
==126==The Duke hath put on a religious life,
==127==And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

**JAQ. DE B.**
==128==He hath.

**JAQ.**
==129==To him will I. Out of these convertites
==130==There is much matter to be heard and learn’d.
*(To Duke Senior.)*
==131==You to your former honor I bequeath,
==132==Your patience and your virtue well deserves it;
*(To Orlando.)*
==133==You to a love, that your true faith doth merit;
*(To Oliver.)*
==134==You to your land, and love, and great allies;
*(To Silvius.)*
==135==You to a long and well-deserved bed;
*(To Touchstone.)*
==136==And you to wrangling, for thy loving voyage
==137==Is but for two months victuall’d.—So to your pleasures,
==138==I am for other than for dancing measures.

**DUKE S.**
==139==Stay, Jaques, stay.

**JAQ.**
==140==To see no pastime I. What you would have
==141==I’ll stay to know at your abandon’d cave.

*Exit.*

**DUKE S.**
==142==Proceed, proceed. We’ll begin these rites,
==143==As we do trust they’ll end, in true delights.

*A dance.*

*Exeunt all but Rosalind.*
