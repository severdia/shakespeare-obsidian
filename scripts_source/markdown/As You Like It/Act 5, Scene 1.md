## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*The Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Clown (Touchstone) and Audrey.*

**TOUCH.**
We shall find a time, Audrey, patience, gentle Audrey.

**AUD.**
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.

**TOUCH.**
A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you.

**AUD.**
Ay, I know who ’tis; he hath no interest in me in the world. Here comes the man you mean.

*Enter William.*

**TOUCH.**
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown. By my troth, we that have good wits have much to answer for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.

**WILL.**
Good ev’n, Audrey.

**AUD.**
God ye good ev’n, William.

**WILL.**
And good ev’n to you, sir.

**TOUCH.**
Good ev’n, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head; nay, prithee be cover’d. How old are you, friend?

**WILL.**
Five and twenty, sir.

**TOUCH.**
A ripe age. Is thy name William?

**WILL.**
William, sir.

**TOUCH.**
A fair name. Wast born i’ the forest here?

**WILL.**
Ay, sir, I thank God.

**TOUCH.**
“Thank God”—a good answer. Art rich?

**WILL.**
Faith, sir, so, so.

**TOUCH.**
“So, so” is good, very good, very excellent good; and yet it is not, it is but so, so. Art thou wise?

**WILL.**
Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.

**TOUCH.**
Why, thou say’st well. I do now remember a saying, “The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool.” The heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid?

**WILL.**
I do, sir.

**TOUCH.**
Give me your hand. Art thou learned?

**WILL.**
No, sir.

**TOUCH.**
Then learn this of me: to have, is to have. For it is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being pour’d out of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty the other. For all your writers do consent that *ipse* is he: now, you are not *ipse*, for I am he.

**WILL.**
Which he, sir?

**TOUCH.**
He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, abandon—which is in the vulgar leave—the society—which in the boorish is company—of this female—which in the common is woman; which together is, abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or to thy better understanding, diest; or (to wit) I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage. I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction; I will o’errun thee with policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways: therefore tremble and depart.

**AUD.**
Do, good William.

**WILL.**
God rest you merry, sir.

*Exit.*

*Enter Corin.*

**COR.**
Our master and mistress seeks you. Come away, away!

**TOUCH.**
Trip, Audrey, trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.

*Exeunt.*
