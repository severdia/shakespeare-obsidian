## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Rosalind and Celia.*

**ROS.**
==1== Never talk to me, I will weep.

**CEL.**
==2== Do, I prithee, but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man.

**ROS.**
==3== But have I not cause to weep?

**CEL.**
==4== As good cause as one would desire, therefore weep.

**ROS.**
==5== His very hair is of the dissembling color.

**CEL.**
==6== Something browner than Judas’s. Marry, his kisses are Judas’s own children.

**ROS.**
==7== I’ faith, his hair is of a good color.

**CEL.**
==8== An excellent color. Your chestnut was ever the only color.

**ROS.**
==9== And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread.

**CEL.**
==10== He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana. A nun of winter’s sisterhood kisses not more religiously, the very ice of chastity is in them.

**ROS.**
==11== But why did he swear he would come this morning, and comes not?

**CEL.**
==12== Nay certainly there is no truth in him.

**ROS.**
==13== Do you think so?

**CEL.**
==14== Yes, I think he is not a pick-purse nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do think him as concave as a cover’d goblet or a worm-eaten nut.

**ROS.**
==15== Not true in love?

**CEL.**
==16== Yes, when he is in—but I think he is not in.

**ROS.**
==17== You have heard him swear downright he was.

**CEL.**
==18== “Was” is not “is.” Besides, the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father.

**ROS.**
==19== I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him. He ask’d me of what parentage I was. I told him of as good as he, so he laugh’d and let me go. But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a man as Orlando?

**CEL.**
==20== O, that’s a brave man! He writes brave verses, speaks brave words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of his lover, as a puisne tilter, that spurs his horse but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble goose. But all’s brave that youth mounts and folly guides. Who comes here?

*Enter Corin.*

**COR.**
==21== Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
==22== After the shepherd that complain’d of love,
==23== Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
==24== Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
==25== That was his mistress.

**CEL.**
==25==            Well; and what of him?

**COR.**
==26== If you will see a pageant truly play’d
==27== Between the pale complexion of true love
==28== And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
==29== Go hence a little, and I shall conduct you,
==30== If you will mark it.

**ROS.**
==30==            O, come, let us remove,
==31== The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
==32== Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
==33== I’ll prove a busy actor in their play.

*Exeunt.*
