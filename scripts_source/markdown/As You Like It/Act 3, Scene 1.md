## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 7|← Act 2, Scene 7]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*The Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Duke Frederick, Lords, and Oliver.*

**DUKE F.**
==1== Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be.
==2== But were I not the better part made mercy,
==3== I should not seek an absent argument
==4== Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
==5== Find out thy brother, wheresoe’er he is;
==6== Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
==7== Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
==8== To seek a living in our territory.
==9== Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
==10== Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
==11== Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother’s mouth
==12== Of what we think against thee.

**OLIV.**
==13== O that your Highness knew my heart in this!
==14== I never lov’d my brother in my life.

**DUKE F.**
==15== More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors,
==16== And let my officers of such a nature
==17== Make an extent upon his house and lands.
==18== Do this expediently, and turn him going.

*Exeunt.*
