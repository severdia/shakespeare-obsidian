## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*The Duke’s palace.*

*Enter Duke Frederick with Lords.*

**DUKE F.**
==1==Can it be possible that no man saw them?
==2==It cannot be. Some villains of my court
==3==Are of consent and sufferance in this.

**1. LORD. COURT.**
==4==I cannot hear of any that did see her.
==5==The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
==6==Saw her a-bed, and in the morning early
==7==They found the bed untreasur’d of their mistress.

**2. LORD. COURT.**
==8==My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
==9==Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
==10==Hisperia, the princess’ gentlewoman,
==11==Confesses that she secretly o’erheard
==12==Your daughter and her cousin much commend
==13==The parts and graces of the wrestler
==14==That did but lately foil the sinowy Charles,
==15==And she believes, where ever they are gone,
==16==That youth is surely in their company.

**DUKE F.**
==17==Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither.
==18==If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
==19==I’ll make him find him. Do this suddenly;
==20==And let not search and inquisition quail
==21==To bring again these foolish runaways.

*Exeunt.*
