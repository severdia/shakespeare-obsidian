## Act 2, Scene 7
[[Act 2, Scene 6|← Act 2, Scene 6]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*A table set out. Enter Duke Senior, Amiens, and Lords, like outlaws.*

**DUKE S.**
==1== I think he be transform’d into a beast,
==2== For I can no where find him like a man.

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==3== My lord, he is but even now gone hence;
==4== Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

**DUKE S.**
==5== If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
==6== We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
==7== Go seek him, tell him I would speak with him.

*Enter Jaques.*

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==8== He saves my labor by his own approach.

**DUKE S.**
==9== Why, how now, monsieur, what a life is this,
==10== That your poor friends must woo your company?
==11== What, you look merrily!

**JAQ.**
==12== A fool, a fool! I met a fool i’ th’ forest,
==13== A motley fool. A miserable world!
==14== As I do live by food, I met a fool,
==15== Who laid him down, and bask’d him in the sun,
==16== And rail’d on Lady Fortune in good terms,
==17== In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.
==18== “Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,
==19== “Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.”
==20== And then he drew a dial from his poke,
==21== And looking on it, with lack-lustre eye,
==22== Says very wisely, “It is ten a’ clock.
==23== Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.
==24== ’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
==25== And after one hour more ’twill be eleven,
==26== And so from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
==27== And then from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
==28== And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear
==29== The motley fool thus moral on the time,
==30== My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
==31== That fools should be so deep contemplative;
==32== And I did laugh sans intermission
==33== An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
==34== A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.

**DUKE S.**
==35== What fool is this?

**JAQ.**
==36== O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
==37== And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
==38== They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,
==39== Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
==40== After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm’d
==41== With observation, the which he vents
==42== In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
==43== I am ambitious for a motley coat.

**DUKE S.**
==44== Thou shalt have one.

**JAQ.**
==44==            It is my only suit⁠—
==45== Provided that you weed your better judgments
==46== Of all opinion that grows rank in them
==47== That I am wise. I must have liberty
==48== Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
==49== To blow on whom I please, for so fools have;
==50== And they that are most galled with my folly,
==51== They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
==52== The why is plain as way to parish church:
==53== He that a fool doth very wisely hit
==54== Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
==55== Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,
==56== The wise man’s folly is anatomiz’d
==57== Even by the squand’ring glances of the fool.
==58== Invest me in my motley; give me leave
==59== To speak my mind, and I will through and through
==60== Cleanse the foul body of th’ infected world,
==61== If they will patiently receive my medicine.

**DUKE S.**
==62== Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.

**JAQ.**
==63== What, for a counter, would I do but good?

**DUKE S.**
==64== Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
==65== For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
==66== As sensual as the brutish sting itself,
==67== And all th’ embossed sores, and headed evils,
==68== That thou with license of free foot hast caught,
==69== Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

**JAQ.**
==70== Why, who cries out on pride
==71== That can therein tax any private party?
==72== Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
==73== Till that the weary very means do ebb?
==74== What woman in the city do I name,
==75== When that I say the city-woman bears
==76== The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
==77== Who can come in and say that I mean her,
==78== When such a one as she, such is her neighbor?
==79== Or what is he of basest function,
==80== That says his bravery is not on my cost,
==81== Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
==82== His folly to the mettle of my speech?
==83== There then! How then? What then? Let me see wherein
==84== My tongue hath wrong’d him; if it do him right,
==85== Then he hath wrong’d himself. If he be free,
==86== Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies,
==87== Unclaim’d of any man. But who comes here?

*Enter Orlando with his sword drawn.*

**ORL.**
==88== Forbear, and eat no more.

**JAQ.**
==88==               Why, I have eat none yet.

**ORL.**
==89== Nor shalt not, till necessity be serv’d.

**JAQ.**
==90== Of what kind should this cock come of?

**DUKE S.**
==91== Art thou thus bolden’d, man, by thy distress?
==92== Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
==93== That in civility thou seem’st so empty?

**ORL.**
==94== You touch’d my vein at first. The thorny point
==95== Of bare distress hath ta’en from me the show
==96== Of smooth civility; yet am I inland bred,
==97== And know some nurture. But forbear, I say,
==98== He dies that touches any of this fruit
==99== Till I and my affairs are answered.

**JAQ.**
==100== And you will not be answer’d with reason,
==101== I must die.

**DUKE S.**
==102== What would you have? Your gentleness shall force,
==103== More than your force move us to gentleness.

**ORL.**
==104== I almost die for food, and let me have it.

**DUKE S.**
==105== Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.

**ORL.**
==106== Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you.
==107== I thought that all things had been savage here,
==108== And therefore put I on the countenance
==109== Of stern command’ment. Bur what e’er you are
==110== That in this desert inaccessible,
==111== Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
==112== Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time;
==113== If ever you have look’d on better days,
==114== If ever been where bells have knoll’d to church,
==115== If ever sate at any good man’s feast,
==116== If ever from your eyelids wip’d a tear,
==117== And know what ’tis to pity, and be pitied,
==118== Let gentleness my strong enforcement be,
==119== In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.

**DUKE S.**
==120== True is it that we have seen better days,
==121== And have with holy bell been knoll’d to church,
==122== And sat at good men’s feasts, and wip’d our eyes
==123== Of drops that sacred pity hath engend’red;
==124== And therefore sit you down in gentleness,
==125== And take upon command what help we have
==126== That to your wanting may be minist’red.

**ORL.**
==127== Then but forbear your food a little while,
==128== Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn,
==129== And give it food. There is an old poor man,
==130== Who after me hath many a weary step
==131== Limp’d in pure love; till he be first suffic’d,
==132== Oppress’d with two weak evils, age and hunger,
==133== I will not touch a bit.

**DUKE S.**
==133==            Go find him out,
==134== And we will nothing waste till you return.

**ORL.**
==135== I thank ye, and be blest for your good comfort!

*Exit.*

**DUKE S.**
==136== Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
==137== This wide and universal theatre
==138== Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
==139== Wherein we play in.

**JAQ.**
==139==            All the world’s a stage,
==140== And all the men and women merely players;
==141== They have their exits and their entrances,
==142== And one man in his time plays many parts,
==143== His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
==144== Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.
==145== Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
==146== And shining morning face, creeping like snail
==147== Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
==148== Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
==149== Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
==150== Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
==151== Jealous in honor, sudden, and quick in quarrel,
==152== Seeking the bubble reputation
==153== Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
==154== In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,
==155== With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
==156== Full of wise saws and modern instances;
==157== And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
==158== Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,
==159== With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,
==160== His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide
==161== For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,
==162== Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
==163== And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
==164== That ends this strange eventful history,
==165== Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,
==166== Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

*Enter Orlando with Adam.*

**DUKE S.**
==167== Welcome. Set down your venerable burden,
==168== And let him feed.

**ORL.**
==169== I thank you most for him.

**ADAM.**
==169==               So had you need,
==170== I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

**DUKE S.**
==171== Welcome, fall to. I will not trouble you
==172== As yet to question you about your fortunes.
==173== Give us some music, and, good cousin, sing.

*Song.*

**AMI.**
==174== *Blow, blow, thou winter wind,*
==175== *Thou art not so unkind*
==176== *As man’s ingratitude;*
==177== *Thy tooth is not so keen,*
==178== *Because thou art not seen,*
==179== *Although thy breath be rude.*
==180== *Heigh-ho, sing heigh-ho! Unto the green holly,*
==181== *Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly.*
==182== *Then heigh-ho, the holly!*
==183== *This life is most jolly.*
==184== *Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,*
==185== *That dost not bite so nigh*
==186== *As benefits forgot;*
==187== *Though thou the waters warp,*
==188== *Thy sting is not so sharp*
==189== *As friend rememb’red not.*
==190== *Heigh-ho, sing, etc.*

**DUKE S.**
==191== If that you were the good Sir Rowland’s son,
==192== As you have whisper’d faithfully you were,
==193== And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
==194== Most truly limn’d and living in your face,
==195== Be truly welcome hither. I am the Duke
==196== That lov’d your father. The residue of your fortune,
==197== Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
==198== Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
==199== Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
==200== And let me all your fortunes understand.

*Exeunt.*
