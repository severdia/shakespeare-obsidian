## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Jaques and Lords as foresters.*

**JAQ.**
Which is he that kill’d the deer?

**1. LORD. ARD.**
Sir, it was I.

**JAQ.**
Let’s present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror, and it would do well to set the deer’s horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?

**2. LORD. ARD.**
Yes, sir.

**JAQ.**
Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.

*Music.*

*Song.*

**2. LORD. ARD.**
*What shall he have that kill’d the deer?*
*His leather skin and horns to wear.*
*Then sing him home.*
*The rest shall bear this burden.*
*Take thou no scorn to wear the horn,*
*It was a crest ere thou wast born;*
*Thy father’s father wore it,*
*And thy father bore it.*
*The horn, the horn, the lusty horn*
*Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.*

*Exeunt.*
