## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Jaques and Lords as foresters.*

**JAQ.**
==1==Which is he that kill’d the deer?

**1. LORD. ARD.**
==2==Sir, it was I.

**JAQ.**
==3==Let’s present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror, and it would do well to set the deer’s horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have you no song, forester, for this purpose?

**2. LORD. ARD.**
==4==Yes, sir.

**JAQ.**
==5==Sing it. ’Tis no matter how it be in tune, so it make noise enough.

*Music.*

*Song.*

**2. LORD. ARD.**
==6== *What shall he have that kill’d the deer?*
==7== *His leather skin and horns to wear.*

**JAQ.**
==8==Then sing him home. The rest shall bear this burden.

**2. LORD. ARD.**
==9== *Take thou no scorn to wear the horn,*
==10== *It was a crest ere thou wast born;*
==11==    *Thy father’s father wore it,*
==12==    *And thy father bore it.*
==13== *The horn, the horn, the lusty horn*
==14== *Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.*

*Exeunt.*
