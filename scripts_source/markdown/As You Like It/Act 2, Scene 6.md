## Act 2, Scene 6
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 7|Act 2, Scene 7 →]]

*Another part of the Forest of Arden.*

*Enter Orlando and Adam.*

**ADAM.**
Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food! Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.

**ORL.**
Why, how now, Adam? No greater heart in thee? Live a little, comfort a little, cheer thyself a little. If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I will either be food for it, or bring it for food to thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers. For my sake be comfortable, hold death a while at the arm’s end. I will here be with thee presently, and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will give thee leave to die; but if thou diest before I come, thou art a mocker of my labor. Well said, thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee quickly. Yet thou liest in the bleak air. Come, I will bear thee to some shelter, and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live any thing in this desert. Cheerly, good Adam!

*Exeunt.*
