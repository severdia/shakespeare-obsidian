## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 5|Act 5, Scene 5 →]]

*Another part of the battlefield.*

*Enter Salisbury, Pembroke, and Bigot.*

**SAL.**
==1==I did not think the King so stor’d with friends.

**PEM.**
==2==Up once again! Put spirit in the French;
==3==If they miscarry, we miscarry too.

**SAL.**
==4==That misbegotten devil Faulconbridge,
==5==In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.

**PEM.**
==6==They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.

*Enter Melune wounded.*

**MEL.**
==7==Lead me to the revolts of England here.

**SAL.**
==8==When we were happy we had other names.

**PEM.**
==9==It is the Count Melune.

**SAL.**
==9==              Wounded to death.

**MEL.**
==10==Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold!
==11==Unthread the rude eye of rebellion,
==12==And welcome home again discarded faith.
==13==Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
==14==For if the French be lords of this loud day,
==15==He means to recompense the pains you take
==16==By cutting off your heads. Thus hath he sworn,
==17==And I with him, and many more with me,
==18==Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury,
==19==Even on that altar where we swore to you
==20==Dear amity and everlasting love.

**SAL.**
==21==May this be possible? May this be true?

**MEL.**
==22==Have I not hideous death within my view,
==23==Retaining but a quantity of life,
==24==Which bleeds away even as a form of wax
==25==Resolveth from his figure ’gainst the fire?
==26==What in the world should make me now deceive,
==27==Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
==28==Why should I then be false, since it is true
==29==That I must die here and live hence by truth?
==30==I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
==31==He is forsworn if e’er those eyes of yours
==32==Behold another day break in the east;
==33==But even this night, whose black contagious breath
==34==Already smokes about the burning crest
==35==Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied sun,
==36==Even this ill night your breathing shall expire,
==37==Paying the fine of rated treachery
==38==Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
==39==If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
==40==Commend me to one Hubert with your king;
==41==The love of him, and this respect besides,
==42==For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
==43==Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
==44==In lieu whereof, I pray you bear me hence
==45==From forth the noise and rumor of the field,
==46==Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
==47==In peace, and part this body and my soul
==48==With contemplation and devout desires.

**SAL.**
==49==We do believe thee, and beshrew my soul
==50==But I do love the favor and the form
==51==Of this most fair occasion, by the which
==52==We will untread the steps of damned flight,
==53==And like a bated and retired flood,
==54==Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
==55==Stoop low within those bounds we have o’erlook’d,
==56==And calmly run on in obedience
==57==Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
==58==My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence,
==59==For I do see the cruel pangs of death
==60==Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight,
==61==And happy newness, that intends old right.

*Exeunt leading off Melune.*
