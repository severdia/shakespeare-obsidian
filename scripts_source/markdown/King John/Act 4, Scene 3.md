## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*Before King John’s castle.*

*Enter Arthur on the walls.*

**ARTH.**
==1==The wall is high, and yet will I leap down.
==2==Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
==3==There’s few or none do know me; if they did,
==4==This ship-boy’s semblance hath disguis’d me quite.
==5==I am afraid, and yet I’ll venture it.
==6==If I get down, and do not break my limbs,
==7==I’ll find a thousand shifts to get away.
==8==As good to die and go, as die and stay.
*(Leaps down.)*
==9==O me, my uncle’s spirit is in these stones.
==10==Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!

*Dies.*

*Enter Pembroke, Salisbury, and Bigot.*

**SAL.**
==11==Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury.
==12==It is our safety, and we must embrace
==13==This gentle offer of the perilous time.

**PEM.**
==14==Who brought that letter from the Cardinal?

**SAL.**
==15==The Count Melune, a noble lord of France,
==16==Whose private with me of the Dauphin’s love
==17==Is much more general than these lines import.

**BIG.**
==18==Tomorrow morning let us meet him then.

**SAL.**
==19==Or rather then set forward, for ’twill be
==20==Two long days’ journey, lords, or ere we meet.

*Enter Bastard.*

**BAST.**
==21==Once more today well met, distemper’d lords!
==22==The King by me requests your presence straight.

**SAL.**
==23==The King hath dispossess’d himself of us.
==24==We will not line his thin bestained cloak
==25==With our pure honors, nor attend the foot
==26==That leaves the print of blood where e’er it walks.
==27==Return, and tell him so. We know the worst.

**BAST.**
==28==What e’er you think, good words I think were best.

**SAL.**
==29==Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.

**BAST.**
==30==But there is little reason in your grief;
==31==Therefore ’twere reason you had manners now.

**PEM.**
==32==Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.

**BAST.**
==33==’Tis true—to hurt his master, no man else.

**SAL.**
==34==This is the prison.
*(Seeing Arthur.)*
==34==           What is he lies here?

**PEM.**
==35==O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
==36==The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.

**SAL.**
==37==Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
==38==Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.

**BIG.**
==39==Or when he doom’d this beauty to a grave,
==40==Found it too precious-princely for a grave.

**SAL.**
==41==Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
==42==Or have you read, or heard, or could you think?
==43==Or do you almost think, although you see,
==44==That you do see? Could thought, without this object,
==45==Form such another? This is the very top,
==46==The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
==47==Of murder’s arms. This is the bloodiest shame,
==48==The wildest savagery, the vildest stroke,
==49==That ever wall-ey’d wrath or staring rage
==50==Presented to the tears of soft remorse.

**PEM.**
==51==All murders past do stand excus’d in this;
==52==And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
==53==Shall give a holiness, a purity,
==54==To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
==55==And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
==56==Exampled by this heinous spectacle.

**BAST.**
==57==It is a damned and a bloody work,
==58==The graceless action of a heavy hand⁠—
==59==If that it be the work of any hand.

**SAL.**
==60==If that it be the work of any hand?
==61==We had a kind of light what would ensue.
==62==It is the shameful work of Hubert’s hand,
==63==The practice and the purpose of the King;
==64==From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
==65==Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
==66==And breathing to his breathless excellence
==67==The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
==68==Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
==69==Never to be infected with delight,
==70==Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
==71==Till I have set a glory to this hand,
==72==By giving it the worship of revenge.

**BOTH PEM. AND BIG.**
==73==Our souls religiously confirm thy words.

*Enter Hubert.*

**HUB.**
==74==Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you.
==75==Arthur doth live, the King hath sent for you.

**SAL.**
==76==O, he is bold, and blushes not at death.
==77==Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!

**HUB.**
==78==I am no villain.

**SAL.**
==78==        Must I rob the law?

*Drawing his sword.*

**BAST.**
==79==Your sword is bright, sir, put it up again.

**SAL.**
==80==Not till I sheathe it in a murderer’s skin.

**HUB.**
==81==Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
==82==By heaven, I think my sword’s as sharp as yours.
==83==I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
==84==Nor tempt the danger of my true defense,
==85==Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
==86==Your worth, your greatness, and nobility.

**BIG.**
==87==Out, dunghill! Dar’st thou brave a nobleman?

**HUB.**
==88==Not for my life; but yet I dare defend
==89==My innocent life against an emperor.

**SAL.**
==90==Thou art a murderer.

**HUB.**
==90==           Do not prove me so;
==91==Yet I am none. Whose tongue soe’er speaks false,
==92==Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.

**PEM.**
==93==Cut him to pieces.

**BAST.**
==93==           Keep the peace, I say.

**SAL.**
==94==Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.

**BAST.**
==95==Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury.
==96==If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
==97==Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
==98==I’ll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime,
==99==Or I’ll so maul you and your toasting-iron
==100==That you shall think the devil is come from hell.

**BIG.**
==101==What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
==102==Second a villain and a murderer?

**HUB.**
==103==Lord Bigot, I am none.

**BIG.**
==103==              Who kill’d this prince?

**HUB.**
==104==’Tis not an hour since I left him well.
==105==I honor’d him, I lov’d him, and will weep
==106==My date of life out for his sweet live’s loss.

**SAL.**
==107==Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
==108==For villainy is not without such rheum,
==109==And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
==110==Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
==111==Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
==112==Th’ uncleanly savors of a slaughter-house,
==113==For I am stifled with this smell of sin.

**BIG.**
==114==Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!

**PEM.**
==115==There, tell the King, he may inquire us out.

*Exeunt Lords.*

**BAST.**
==116==Here’s a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
==117==Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
==118==Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
==119==Art thou damn’d, Hubert.

**HUB.**
==119==              Do but hear me, sir.

**BAST.**
==120==Ha? I’ll tell thee what;
==121==Thou’rt damn’d as black—nay, nothing is so black⁠—
==122==Thou art more deep damn’d than Prince Lucifer.
==123==There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
==124==As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.

**HUB.**
==125==Upon my soul⁠—

**BAST.**
==125==        If thou didst but consent
==126==To this most cruel act, do but despair,
==127==And if thou want’st a cord, the smallest thread
==128==That ever spider twisted from her womb
==129==Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be a beam
==130==To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
==131==Put but a little water in a spoon,
==132==And it shall be as all the ocean,
==133==Enough to stifle such a villain up.
==134==I do suspect thee very grievously.

**HUB.**
==135==If I in act, consent, or sin of thought
==136==Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
==137==Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
==138==Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
==139==I left him well.

**BAST.**
==139==        Go, bear him in thine arms.
==140==I am amaz’d, methinks, and lose my way
==141==Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
==142==How easy dost thou take all England up
==143==From forth this morsel of dead royalty!
==144==The life, the right, and truth of all this realm
==145==Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
==146==To tug and scamble, and to part by th’ teeth
==147==The unowed interest of proud swelling state.
==148==Now for the bare-pick’d bone of majesty
==149==Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest,
==150==And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace;
==151==Now powers from home and discontents at home
==152==Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
==153==As doth a raven on a sick-fall’n beast,
==154==The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
==155==Now happy he whose cloak and center can
==156==Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child,
==157==And follow me with speed. I’ll to the King.
==158==A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
==159==And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.

*Exeunt.*
