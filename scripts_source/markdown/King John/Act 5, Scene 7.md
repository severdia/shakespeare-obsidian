## Act 5, Scene 7
[[Act 5, Scene 6|← Act 5, Scene 6]]

*The orchard at Swinstead Abbey.*

*Enter Prince Henry, Salisbury, and Bigot.*

**P. HEN.**
==1==It is too late, the life of all his blood
==2==Is touch’d corruptibly; and his pure brain
==3==(Which some suppose the soul’s frail dwelling-house) 
==4==Doth by the idle comments that it makes
==5==Foretell the ending of mortality.

*Enter Pembroke.*

**PEM.**
==6==His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
==7==That being brought into the open air,
==8==It would allay the burning quality
==9==Of that fell poison which assaileth him.

**P. HEN.**
==10==Let him be brought into the orchard here.
==11==Doth he still rage?

*Exit Bigot.*

**PEM.**
==11==           He is more patient
==12==Than when you left him; even now he sung.

**P. HEN.**
==13==O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes
==14==In their continuance will not feel themselves.
==15==Death, having prey’d upon the outward parts,
==16==Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
==17==Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
==18==With many legions of strange fantasies,
==19==Which in their throng and press to that last hold,
==20==Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that death should sing.
==21==I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
==22==Who chaunts a doleful hymn to his own death,
==23==And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
==24==His soul and body to their lasting rest.

**SAL.**
==25==Be of good comfort, Prince, for you are born
==26==To set a form upon that indigest
==27==Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.

*King John brought in.*

**K. JOHN.**
==28==Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room,
==29==It would not out at windows nor at doors.
==30==There is so hot a summer in my bosom
==31==That all my bowels crumble up to dust.
==32==I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
==33==Upon a parchment, and against this fire
==34==Do I shrink up.

**P. HEN.**
==34==        How fares your Majesty?

**K. JOHN.**
==35==Poison’d—ill fare! Dead, forsook, cast off,
==36==And none of you will bid the winter come
==37==To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
==38==Nor let my kingdom’s rivers take their course
==39==Through my burn’d bosom, nor entreat the north
==40==To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
==41==And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,
==42==I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
==43==And so ingrateful, you deny me that.

**P. HEN.**
==44==O that there were some virtue in my tears,
==45==That might relieve you!

**K. JOHN.**
==45==              The salt in them is hot.
==46==Within me is a hell, and there the poison
==47==Is as a fiend confin’d to tyrannize
==48==On unreprievable condemned blood.

*Enter Bastard.*

**BAST.**
==49==O, I am scalded with my violent motion
==50==And spleen of speed to see your Majesty!

**K. JOHN.**
==51==O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye.
==52==The tackle of my heart is crack’d and burn’d,
==53==And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
==54==Are turned to one thread, one little hair.
==55==My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
==56==Which holds but till thy news be uttered,
==57==And then all this thou seest is but a clod
==58==And module of confounded royalty.

**BAST.**
==59==The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
==60==Where God he knows how we shall answer him;
==61==For in a night the best part of my pow’r,
==62==As I upon advantage did remove,
==63==Were in the Washes all unwarily
==64==Devoured by the unexpected flood.

*The King dies.*

**SAL.**
==65==You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
==66==My liege, my lord! But now a king, now thus.

**P. HEN.**
==67==Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
==68==What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
==69==When this was now a king, and now is clay?

**BAST.**
==70==Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
==71==To do the office for thee of revenge,
==72==And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
==73==As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
==74==Now, now, you stars, that move in your right spheres,
==75==Where be your pow’rs? Show now your mended faiths,
==76==And instantly return with me again
==77==To push destruction and perpetual shame
==78==Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
==79==Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
==80==The Dauphin rages at our very heels.

**SAL.**
==81==It seems you know not then so much as we.
==82==The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
==83==Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
==84==And brings from him such offers of our peace
==85==As we with honor and respect may take,
==86==With purpose presently to leave this war.

**BAST.**
==87==He will the rather do it when he sees
==88==Ourselves well sinewed to our defense.

**SAL.**
==89==Nay, ’tis in a manner done already,
==90==For many carriages he hath dispatch’d
==91==To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
==92==To the disposing of the Cardinal,
==93==With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,
==94==If you think meet, this afternoon will post
==95==To consummate this business happily.

**BAST.**
==96==Let it be so, and you, my noble Prince,
==97==With other princes that may best be spar’d,
==98==Shall wait upon your father’s funeral.

**P. HEN.**
==99==At Worcester must his body be interr’d,
==100==For so he will’d it.

**BAST.**
==100==           Thither shall it then;
==101==And happily may your sweet self put on
==102==The lineal state and glory of the land!
==103==To whom with all submission, on my knee,
==104==I do bequeath my faithful services
==105==And true subjection everlastingly.

**SAL.**
==106==And the like tender of our love we make,
==107==To rest without a spot forevermore.

**P. HEN.**
==108==I have a kind soul that would give thanks,
==109==And knows not how to do it but with tears.

**BAST.**
==110==O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
==111==Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
==112==This England never did, nor never shall,
==113==Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
==114==But when it first did help to wound itself.
==115==Now these her princes are come home again,
==116==Come the three corners of the world in arms,
==117==And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
==118==If England to itself do rest but true.

*Exeunt.*
