## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*France. Before the town of Angiers.*

*Enter, before Angiers, Philip, King of France, Lewis the Dauphin, Constance, Arthur, with forces, at one door; at the other, Austria with forces.*

**K. PHI.**
==1==Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
==2==Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
==3==Richard, that robb’d the lion of his heart,
==4==And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
==5==By this brave duke came early to his grave;
==6==And for amends to his posterity,
==7==At our importance hither is he come
==8==To spread his colors, boy, in thy behalf,
==9==And to rebuke the usurpation
==10==Of thy unnatural uncle, English John.
==11==Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.

**ARTH.**
==12==God shall forgive you Coeur de Lion’s death
==13==The rather that you give his offspring life,
==14==Shadowing their right under your wings of war.
==15==I give you welcome with a powerless hand.
==16==But with a heart full of unstained love.
==17==Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke.

**K. PHI.**
==18==A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?

**AUST.**
==19==Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss
==20==As seal to this indenture of my love:
==21==That to my home I will no more return
==22==Till Angiers, and the right thou hast in France,
==23==Together with that pale, that white-fac’d shore,
==24==Whose foot spurns back the ocean’s roaring tides
==25==And coops from other lands her islanders,
==26==Even till that England, hedg’d in with the main,
==27==That water-walled bulwark, still secure
==28==And confident from foreign purposes,
==29==Even till that utmost corner of the west
==30==Salute thee for her king; till then, fair boy,
==31==Will I not think of home, but follow arms.

**CONST.**
==32==O, take his mother’s thanks, a widow’s thanks,
==33==Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
==34==To make a more requital to your love!

**AUST.**
==35==The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
==36==In such a just and charitable war.

**K. PHI.**
==37==Well, then to work! Our cannon shall be bent
==38==Against the brows of this resisting town.
==39==Call for our chiefest men of discipline
==40==To cull the plots of best advantages.
==41==We’ll lay before this town our royal bones,
==42==Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen’s blood,
==43==But we will make it subject to this boy.

**CONST.**
==44==Stay for an answer to your embassy,
==45==Lest unadvis’d you stain your swords with blood.
==46==My Lord Chatillion may from England bring
==47==That right in peace which here we urge in war,
==48==And then we shall repent each drop of blood
==49==That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.

*Enter Chatillion.*

**K. PHI.**
==50==A wonder, lady! Lo upon thy wish
==51==Our messenger Chatillion is arriv’d!
==52==What England says, say briefly, gentle lord,
==53==We coldly pause for thee; Chatillion, speak.

**CHAT.**
==54==Then turn your forces from this paltry siege,
==55==And stir them up against a mightier task.
==56==England, impatient of your just demands,
==57==Hath put himself in arms. The adverse winds,
==58==Whose leisure I have stay’d, have given him time
==59==To land his legions all as soon as I;
==60==His marches are expedient to this town,
==61==His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
==62==With him along is come the mother-queen,
==63==An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
==64==With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;
==65==With them a bastard of the king’s deceas’d,
==66==And all th’ unsettled humors of the land,
==67==Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
==68==With ladies’ faces and fierce dragons’ spleens,
==69==Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
==70==Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
==71==To make a hazard of new fortunes here.
==72==In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
==73==Than now the English bottoms have waft o’er
==74==Did never float upon the swelling tide
==75==To do offense and scathe in Christendom.
==76==The interruption of their churlish drums
==77==Cuts off more circumstance. They are at hand,
*(Drum beats.)*
==78==To parley or to fight, therefore prepare.

**K. PHI.**
==79==How much unlook’d for is this expedition!

**AUST.**
==80==By how much unexpected, by so much
==81==We must awake endeavor for defense,
==82==For courage mounteth with occasion.
==83==Let them be welcome then, we are prepar’d.

*Enter King John of England, Bastard, Queen Elinor, Blanch, Pembroke, and others.*

**K. JOHN.**
==84==Peace be to France—if France in peace permit
==85==Our just and lineal entrance to our own;
==86==If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
==87==Whiles we, God’s wrathful agent, do correct
==88==Their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven.

**K. PHI.**
==89==Peace be to England, if that war return
==90==From France to England, there to live in peace.
==91==England we love, and for that England’s sake
==92==With burden of our armor here we sweat.
==93==This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
==94==But thou from loving England art so far
==95==That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king,
==96==Cut off the sequence of posterity,
==97==Outfaced infant state, and done a rape
==98==Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
==99==Look here upon thy brother Geffrey’s face:
==100==These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his;
==101==This little abstract doth contain that large
==102==Which died in Geffrey; and the hand of time
==103==Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
==104==That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
==105==And this his son; England was Geffrey’s right,
==106==And this is Geffrey’s in the name of God.
==107==How comes it then that thou art call’d a king,
==108==When living blood doth in these temples beat,
==109==Which owe the crown that thou o’ermasterest?

**K. JOHN.**
==110==From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
==111==To draw my answer from thy articles?

**K. PHI.**
==112==From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
==113==In any breast of strong authority,
==114==To look into the blots and stains of right.
==115==That judge hath made me guardian to this boy,
==116==Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong,
==117==And by whose help I mean to chastise it.

**K. JOHN.**
==118==Alack, thou dost usurp authority.

**K. PHI.**
==119==Excuse it is to beat usurping down.

**Q. EL.**
==120==Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?

**CONST.**
==121==Let me make answer: thy usurping son.

**Q. EL.**
==122==Out, insolent, thy bastard shall be king
==123==That thou mayst be a queen, and check the world!

**CONST.**
==124==My bed was ever to thy son as true
==125==As thine was to thy husband, and this boy
==126==Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
==127==Than thou and John in manners, being as like
==128==As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
==129==My boy a bastard? By my soul I think
==130==His father never was so true begot⁠—
==131==It cannot be, and if thou wert his mother.

**Q. EL.**
==132==There’s a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.

**CONST.**
==133==There’s a good grandame, boy, that would blot thee.

**AUST.**
==134==Peace!

**BAST.**
==134==    Hear the crier.

**AUST.**
==134==              What the devil art thou?

**BAST.**
==135==One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
==136==And ’a may catch your hide and you alone.
==137==You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
==138==Whose valor plucks dead lions by the beard;
==139==I’ll smoke your skin-coat and I catch you right.
==140==Sirrah, look to’t, i’ faith I will, i’ faith.

**BLANCH.**
==141==O, well did he become that lion’s robe,
==142==That did disrobe the lion of that robe!

**BAST.**
==143==It lies as sightly on the back of him
==144==As great Alcides’ shows upon an ass.
==145==But, ass, I’ll take that burden from your back,
==146==Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.

**AUST.**
==147==What cracker is this same that deafs our ears
==148==With this abundance of superfluous breath?
==149==King Philip, determine what we shall do straight.

**K. PHI.**
==150==Women and fools, break off your conference.
==151==King John, this is the very sum of all:
==152==England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
==153==In right of Arthur do I claim of thee.
==154==Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?

**K. JOHN.**
==155==My life as soon. I do defy thee, France.
==156==Arthur of Britain, yield thee to my hand,
==157==And out of my dear love I’ll give thee more
==158==Than e’er the coward hand of France can win.
==159==Submit thee, boy.

**Q. EL.**
==159==           Come to thy grandame, child.

**CONST.**
==160==Do, child, go to it grandame, child,
==161==Give grandame kingdom, and it grandame will
==162==Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig.
==163==There’s a good grandame.

**ARTH.**
==163==              Good my mother, peace.
==164==I would that I were low laid in my grave,
==165==I am not worth this coil that’s made for me.

**Q. EL.**
==166==His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.

**CONST.**
==167==Now shame upon you, whe’er she does or no!
==168==His grandame’s wrongs, and not his mother’s shames,
==169==Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
==170==Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;
==171==Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be brib’d
==172==To do him justice, and revenge on you.

**Q. EL.**
==173==Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!

**CONST.**
==174==Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth,
==175==Call not me slanderer! Thou and thine usurp
==176==The dominations, royalties, and rights
==177==Of this oppressed boy. This is thy eldest son’s son,
==178==Infortunate in nothing but in thee.
==179==Thy sins are visited in this poor child,
==180==The canon of the law is laid on him,
==181==Being but the second generation
==182==Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.

**K. JOHN.**
==183==Bedlam, have done.

**CONST.**
==183==           I have but this to say,
==184==That he is not only plagued for her sin,
==185==But God hath made her sin and her the plague
==186==On this removed issue, plagued for her,
==187==And with her plague, her sin; his injury
==188==Her injury, the beadle to her sin⁠—
==189==All punish’d in the person of this child,
==190==And all for her. A plague upon her!

**Q. EL.**
==191==Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
==192==A will that bars the title of thy son.

**CONST.**
==193==Ay, who doubts that? A will! A wicked will,
==194==A woman’s will, a cank’red grandam’s will!

**K. PHI.**
==195==Peace, lady, pause, or be more temperate.
==196==It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
==197==To these ill-tuned repetitions.
==198==Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
==199==These men of Angiers; let us hear them speak
==200==Whose title they admit, Arthur’s or John’s.

*Trumpet sounds. Enter Hubert and other Citizens upon the walls.*

**HUB.**
==201==Who is it that hath warn’d us to the walls?

**K. PHI.**
==202==’Tis France, for England.

**K. JOHN.**
==202==              England for itself.
==203==You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects⁠—

**K. PHI.**
==204==You loving men of Angiers, Arthur’s subjects,
==205==Our trumpet call’d you to this gentle parle⁠—

**K. JOHN.**
==206==For our advantage—therefore hear us first:
==207==These flags of France, that are advanced here
==208==Before the eye and prospect of your town,
==209==Have hither march’d to your endamagement.
==210==The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
==211==And ready mounted are they to spit forth
==212==Their iron indignation ’gainst your walls;
==213==All preparation for a bloody siege
==214==And merciless proceeding by these French
==215==Confronts your city’s eyes, your winking gates;
==216==And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
==217==That as a waist doth girdle you about,
==218==By the compulsion of their ordinance
==219==By this time from their fixed beds of lime
==220==Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
==221==For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
==222==But on the sight of us, your lawful King,
==223==Who painfully with much expedient march
==224==Have brought a countercheck before your gates,
==225==To save unscratch’d your city’s threat’ned cheeks,
==226==Behold, the French amaz’d vouchsafe a parle,
==227==And now instead of bullets wrapp’d in fire,
==228==To make a shaking fever in your walls,
==229==They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
==230==To make a faithless error in your ears;
==231==Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
==232==And let us in—your King, whose labor’d spirits,
==233==Forewearied in this action of swift speed,
==234==Craves harborage within your city walls.

**K. PHI.**
==235==When I have said, make answer to us both.
==236==Lo in this right hand, whose protection
==237==Is most divinely vow’d upon the right
==238==Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
==239==Son to the elder brother of this man,
==240==And king o’er him and all that he enjoys.
==241==For this down-trodden equity, we tread
==242==In warlike march these greens before your town,
==243==Being no further enemy to you
==244==Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
==245==In the relief of this oppressed child
==246==Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
==247==To pay that duty which you truly owe
==248==To him that owes it, namely this young prince,
==249==And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
==250==Save in aspect, hath all offense seal’d up;
==251==Our cannons’ malice vainly shall be spent
==252==Against th’ invulnerable clouds of heaven,
==253==And with a blessed and unvex’d retire,
==254==With unhack’d swords, and helmets all unbruis’d,
==255==We will bear home that lusty blood again
==256==Which here we came to spout against your town,
==257==And leave your children, wives, and you in peace.
==258==But if you fondly pass our proffer’d offer,
==259==’Tis not the rounder of your old-fac’d walls
==260==Can hide you from our messengers of war,
==261==Though all these English and their discipline
==262==Were harbor’d in their rude circumference.
==263==Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
==264==In that behalf which we have challeng’d it?
==265==Or shall we give the signal to our rage,
==266==And stalk in blood to our possession?

**HUB.**
==267==In brief, we are the King of England’s subjects:
==268==For him, and in his right, we hold this town.

**K. JOHN.**
==269==Acknowledge then the King, and let me in.

**HUB.**
==270==That can we not; but he that proves the King,
==271==To him will we prove loyal. Till that time
==272==Have we ramm’d up our gates against the world.

**K. JOHN.**
==273==Doth not the crown of England prove the King?
==274==And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
==275==Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England’s breed⁠—

**BAST.**
==276==Bastards, and else.

**K. JOHN.**
==277==To verify our title with their lives.

**K. PHI.**
==278==As many and as well-born bloods as those⁠—

**BAST.**
==279==Some bastards too.

**K. PHI.**
==280==Stand in his face to contradict his claim.

**HUB.**
==281==Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
==282==We for the worthiest hold the right from both.

**K. JOHN.**
==283==Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
==284==That to their everlasting residence,
==285==Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet
==286==In dreadful trial of our kingdom’s king!

**K. PHI.**
==287==Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! To arms!

**BAST.**
==288==Saint George, that swing’d the dragon, and e’er since
==289==Sits on ’s horseback at mine hostess’ door,
==290==Teach us some fence!
*(To Austria.)*
==290==              Sirrah, were I at home,
==291==At your den, sirrah, with your lioness,
==292==I would set an ox-head to your lion’s hide,
==293==And make a monster of you.

**AUST.**
==293==                Peace, no more.

**BAST.**
==294==O, tremble! For you hear the lion roar.

**K. JOHN.**
==295==Up higher to the plain, where we’ll set forth
==296==In best appointment all our regiments.

**BAST.**
==297==Speed then to take advantage of the field.

**K. PHI.**
==298==It shall be so, and at the other hill
==299==Command the rest to stand. God and our right!

*Exeunt. Hubert and Citizens remain above.*

*Here, after excursions, enter the Herald of France with Trumpets to the gates.*

**FR. HER.**
==300==You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,
==301==And let young Arthur Duke of Britain in,
==302==Who by the hand of France this day hath made
==303==Much work for tears in many an English mother,
==304==Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground.
==305==Many a widow’s husband groveling lies,
==306==Coldly embracing the discolored earth,
==307==And victory with little loss doth play
==308==Upon the dancing banners of the French,
==309==Who are at hand, triumphantly displayed,
==310==To enter conquerors, and to proclaim
==311==Arthur of Britain England’s King and yours.

*Enter English Herald with Trumpet.*

**E. HER.**
==312==Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells,
==313==King John, your King and England’s, doth approach,
==314==Commander of this hot malicious day.
==315==Their armors, that march’d hence so silver-bright,
==316==Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen’s blood.
==317==There stuck no plume in any English crest
==318==That is removed by a staff of France;
==319==Our colors do return in those same hands
==320==That did display them when we first march’d forth;
==321==And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come
==322==Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
==323==Dy’d in the dying slaughter of their foes.
==324==Open your gates and give the victors way.

**HUB.**
==325==Heralds, from off our tow’rs we might behold,
==326==From first to last, the onset and retire
==327==Of both your armies, whose equality
==328==By our best eyes cannot be censured.
==329==Blood hath bought blood, and blows have answer’d blows;
==330==Strength match’d with strength, and power confronted power:
==331==Both are alike, and both alike we like.
==332==One must prove greatest. While they weigh so even,
==333==We hold our town for neither; yet for both.

*Enter the two Kings with their powers at several doors.*

**K. JOHN.**
==334==France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
==335==Say, shall the current of our right roam on?
==336==Whose passage, vex’d with thy impediment,
==337==Shall leave his native channel and o’erswell
==338==With course disturb’d even thy confining shores,
==339==Unless thou let his silver water keep
==340==A peaceful progress to the ocean.

**K. PHI.**
==341==England, thou hast not sav’d one drop of blood
==342==In this hot trial more than we of France,
==343==Rather lost more. And by this hand I swear,
==344==That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
==345==Before we will lay down our just-borne arms
==346==We’ll put thee down, ’gainst whom these arms we bear,
==347==Or add a royal number to the dead,
==348==Gracing the scroll that tells of this war’s loss
==349==With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.

**BAST.**
==350==Ha, majesty! How high thy glory tow’rs
==351==When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
==352==O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel,
==353==The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs,
==354==And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
==355==In undetermin’d differences of kings.
==356==Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
==357==Cry “havoc,” kings! Back to the stained field,
==358==You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
==359==Then let confusion of one part confirm
==360==The other’s peace. Till then, blows, blood, and death!

**K. JOHN.**
==361==Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?

**K. PHI.**
==362==Speak, citizens, for England. Who’s your king?

**HUB.**
==363==The King of England, when we know the King.

**K. PHI.**
==364==Know him in us, that here hold up his right.

**K. JOHN.**
==365==In us, that are our own great deputy,
==366==And bear possession of our person here,
==367==Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.

**HUB.**
==368==A greater pow’r than we denies all this,
==369==And till it be undoubted, we do lock
==370==Our former scruple in our strong-barr’d gates,
==371==Kings of our fear, until our fears, resolv’d,
==372==Be by some certain king purg’d and depos’d.

**BAST.**
==373==By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
==374==And stand securely on their battlements
==375==As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
==376==At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
==377==Your royal presences be rul’d by me:
==378==Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
==379==Be friends awhile, and both conjointly bend
==380==Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town.
==381==By east and west let France and England mount
==382==Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
==383==Till their soul-fearing clamors have brawl’d down
==384==The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city.
==385==I’d play incessantly upon these jades,
==386==Even till unfenced desolation
==387==Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
==388==That done, dissever your united strengths,
==389==And part your mingled colors once again,
==390==Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
==391==Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
==392==Out of one side her happy minion,
==393==To whom in favor she shall give the day,
==394==And kiss him with a glorious victory.
==395==How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
==396==Smacks it not something of the policy?

**K. JOHN.**
==397==Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
==398==I like it well. France, shall we knit our pow’rs,
==399==And lay this Angiers even with the ground,
==400==Then after fight who shall be king of it?

**BAST.**
==401==And if thou hast the mettle of a king,
==402==Being wrong’d as we are by this peevish town,
==403==Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
==404==As we will ours, against these saucy walls,
==405==And when that we have dash’d them to the ground,
==406==Why then defy each other, and pell-mell
==407==Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.

**K. PHI.**
==408==Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?

**K. JOHN.**
==409==We from the west will send destruction
==410==Into this city’s bosom.

**AUST.**
==411==I from the north.

**K. PHI.**
==411==           Our thunder from the south
==412==Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.

**BAST.**
*(Aside.)*
==413==O prudent discipline! From north to south⁠—
==414==Austria and France shoot in each other’s mouth.
==415==I’ll stir them to it.—Come, away, away!

**HUB.**
==416==Hear us, great kings! Vouchsafe awhile to stay,
==417==And I shall show you peace and fair-fac’d league;
==418==Win you this city without stroke or wound,
==419==Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
==420==That here come sacrifices for the field.
==421==Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.

**K. JOHN.**
==422==Speak on with favor, we are bent to hear.

**HUB.**
==423==That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
==424==Is near to England. Look upon the years
==425==Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.
==426==If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
==427==Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
==428==If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
==429==Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
==430==If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
==431==Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
==432==Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
==433==Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
==434==If not complete of, say he is not she,
==435==And she again wants nothing, to name want,
==436==If want it be not that she is not he.
==437==He is the half part of a blessed man,
==438==Left to be finished by such as she,
==439==And she a fair divided excellence,
==440==Whose fullness of perfection lies in him.
==441==O, two such silver currents when they join
==442==Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
==443==And two such shores to two such streams made one,
==444==Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
==445==To these two princes, if you marry them.
==446==This union shall do more than battery can
==447==To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
==448==With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
==449==The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
==450==And give you entrance; but without this match,
==451==The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
==452==Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
==453==More free from motion, no, not Death himself
==454==In mortal fury half so peremptory,
==455==As we to keep this city.

**BAST.**
==455==              Here’s a stay
==456==That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
==457==Out of his rags! Here’s a large mouth indeed,
==458==That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
==459==Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
==460==As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
==461==What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
==462==He speaks plain cannon-fire, and smoke, and bounce,
==463==He gives the bastinado with his tongue;
==464==Our ears are cudgell’d—not a word of his
==465==But buffets better than a fist of France.
==466==’Zounds, I was never so bethump’d with words
==467==Since I first call’d my brother’s father dad.

**Q. EL.**
==468==Son, list to this conjunction, make this match,
==469==Give with our niece a dowry large enough,
==470==For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
==471==Thy now unsur’d assurance to the crown,
==472==That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
==473==The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
==474==I see a yielding in the looks of France;
==475==Mark how they whisper. Urge them while their souls
==476==Are capable of this ambition,
==477==Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
==478==Of soft petitions, pity, and remorse,
==479==Cool and congeal again to what it was.

**HUB.**
==480==Why answer not the double majesties
==481==This friendly treaty of our threat’ned town?

**K. PHI.**
==482==Speak England first, that hath been forward first
==483==To speak unto this city: what say you?

**K. JOHN.**
==484==If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
==485==Can in this book of beauty read, “I love,”
==486==Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen;
==487==For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
==488==And all that we upon this side the sea
==489==(Except this city now by us besieg’d) 
==490==Find liable to our crown and dignity,
==491==Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
==492==In titles, honors, and promotions,
==493==As she in beauty, education, blood,
==494==Holds hand with any princess of the world.

**K. PHI.**
==495==What say’st thou, boy? Look in the lady’s face.

**LEW.**
==496==I do, my lord, and in her eye I find
==497==A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
==498==The shadow of myself form’d in her eye,
==499==Which being but the shadow of your son,
==500==Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow.
==501==I do protest I never lov’d myself
==502==Till now infixed I beheld myself
==503==Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.

*Whispers with Blanch.*

**BAST.**
*(Aside.)*
==504==Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
==505==Hang’d in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
==506==And quarter’d in her heart! He doth espy
==507==Himself love’s traitor. This is pity now,
==508==That, hang’d and drawn and quarter’d there should be
==509==In such a love so vile a lout as he.

**BLANCH.**
==510==My uncle’s will in this respect is mine.
==511==If he see aught in you that makes him like,
==512==That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,
==513==I can with ease translate it to my will;
==514==Or if you will, to speak more properly,
==515==I will enforce it eas’ly to my love.
==516==Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
==517==That all I see in you is worthy love,
==518==Than this: that nothing do I see in you,
==519==Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
==520==That I can find should merit any hate.

**K. JOHN.**
==521==What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?

**BLANCH.**
==522==That she is bound in honor still to do
==523==What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.

**K. JOHN.**
==524==Speak then, Prince Dauphin, can you love this lady?

**LEW.**
==525==Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love,
==526==For I do love her most unfeignedly.

**K. JOHN.**
==527==Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
==528==Poictiers, and Anjou, these five provinces,
==529==With her to thee, and this addition more,
==530==Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
==531==Philip of France, if thou be pleas’d withal,
==532==Command thy son and daughter to join hands.

**K. PHI.**
==533==It likes us well, young princes; close your hands.

**AUST.**
==534==And your lips too, for I am well assur’d
==535==That I did so when I was first assur’d.

**K. PHI.**
==536==Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
==537==Let in that amity which you have made,
==538==For at Saint Mary’s Chapel presently
==539==The rites of marriage shall be solemniz’d.
==540==Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
==541==I know she is not, for this match made up
==542==Her presence would have interrupted much.
==543==Where is she and her son? Tell me, who knows.

**LEW.**
==544==She is sad and passionate at your Highness’ tent.

**K. PHI.**
==545==And by my faith, this league that we have made
==546==Will give her sadness very little cure.
==547==Brother of England, how may we content
==548==This widow lady? In her right we came,
==549==Which we, God knows, have turn’d another way,
==550==To our own vantage.

**K. JOHN.**
==550==           We will heal up all,
==551==For we’ll create young Arthur Duke of Britain
==552==And Earl of Richmond, and this rich fair town
==553==We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
==554==Some speedy messenger bid her repair
==555==To our solemnity. I trust we shall,
==556==If not fill up the measure of her will,
==557==Yet in some measure satisfy her so
==558==That we shall stop her exclamation.
==559==Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
==560==To this unlook’d-for, unprepared pomp.

*Exeunt all but the Bastard.*

**BAST.**
==561==Mad world, mad kings, mad composition!
==562==John, to stop Arthur’s title in the whole,
==563==Hath willingly departed with a part,
==564==And France, whose armor conscience buckled on,
==565==Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
==566==As God’s own soldier, rounded in the ear
==567==With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
==568==That broker that still breaks the pate of faith,
==569==That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
==570==Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
==571==Who having no external thing to lose
==572==But the word “maid,” cheats the poor maid of that,
==573==That smooth-fac’d gentleman, tickling commodity,
==574==Commodity, the bias of the world⁠—
==575==The world, who of itself is peized well,
==576==Made to run even upon even ground,
==577==Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
==578==This sway of motion, this commodity,
==579==Makes it take head from all indifferency,
==580==From all direction, purpose, course, intent⁠—
==581==And this same bias, this commodity,
==582==This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
==583==Clapp’d on the outward eye of fickle France,
==584==Hath drawn him from his own determin’d aid,
==585==From a resolv’d and honorable war
==586==To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
==587==And why rail I on this commodity?
==588==But for because he hath not woo’d me yet:
==589==Not that I have the power to clutch my hand
==590==When his fair angels would salute my palm,
==591==But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
==592==Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
==593==Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail,
==594==And say there is no sin but to be rich;
==595==And being rich, my virtue then shall be
==596==To say there is no vice but beggary.
==597==Since kings break faith upon commodity,
==598==Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

*Exit.*
