## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Northampton. A room in the castle.*

*Enter Hubert and Executioners.*

**HUB.**
==1== Heat me these irons hot, and look thou stand
==2== Within the arras. When I strike my foot
==3== Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth
==4== And bind the boy which you shall find with me
==5== Fast to the chair. Be heedful. Hence, and watch.

**EXEC.**
==6== I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.

**HUB.**
==7== Uncleanly scruples! Fear not you. Look to’t.
*(Exeunt Executioners.)*
==8== Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.

*Enter Arthur.*

**ARTH.**
==9== Good morrow, Hubert.

**HUB.**
==9==               Good morrow, little prince.

**ARTH.**
==10== As little prince, having so great a title
==11== To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.

**HUB.**
==12== Indeed I have been merrier.

**ARTH.**
==12==                 Mercy on me!
==13== Methinks nobody should be sad but I.
==14== Yet I remember, when I was in France,
==15== Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
==16== Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
==17== So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
==18== I should be as merry as the day is long;
==19== And so I would be here, but that I doubt
==20== My uncle practices more harm to me.
==21== He is afraid of me and I of him.
==22== Is it my fault that I was Geffrey’s son?
==23== No indeed is’t not; and I would to heaven
==24== I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.

**HUB.**
*(Aside.)*
==25== If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
==26== He will awake my mercy, which lies dead;
==27== Therefore I will be sudden, and dispatch.

**ARTH.**
==28== Are you sick, Hubert? You look pale today.
==29== In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
==30== That I might sit all night and watch with you.
==31== I warrant I love you more than you do me.

**HUB.**
*(Aside.)*
==32== His words do take possession of my bosom.⁠—
==33== Read here, young Arthur.
*(Showing a paper.)*
*(Aside.)*
==33==               How now, foolish rheum?
==34== Turning dispiteous torture out of door?
==35== I must be brief, lest resolution drop
==36== Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.⁠—
==37== Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?

**ARTH.**
==38== Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect.
==39== Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?

**HUB.**
==40== Young boy, I must.

**ARTH.**
==40==            And will you?

**HUB.**
==40==                   And I will.

**ARTH.**
==41== Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
==42== I knit my handkercher about your brows
==43== (The best I had, a princess wrought it me) 
==44== And I did never ask it you again;
==45== And with my hand at midnight held your head;
==46== And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
==47== Still and anon cheer’d up the heavy time,
==48== Saying, “What lack you?” and “Where lies your grief?”
==49== Or “What good love may I perform for you?”
==50== Many a poor man’s son would have lien still,
==51== And ne’er have spoke a loving word to you;
==52== But you at your sick service had a prince.
==53== Nay, you may think my love was crafty love,
==54== And call it cunning. Do, and if you will;
==55== If heaven be pleas’d that you must use me ill,
==56== Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes,
==57== These eyes that never did nor never shall
==58== So much as frown on you?

**HUB.**
==58==               I have sworn to do it;
==59== And with hot irons must I burn them out.

**ARTH.**
==60== Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
==61== The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
==62== Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears,
==63== And quench his fiery indignation
==64== Even in the matter of mine innocence;
==65== Nay, after that, consume away in rust,
==66== But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
==67== Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer’d iron?
==68== And if an angel should have come to me
==69== And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
==70== I would not have believ’d him—no tongue but Hubert’s.

**HUB.**
==71== Come forth.
*(Stamps.)*
*(Enter Executioners with a cord, irons, etc.)*
==71==         Do as I bid you do.

**ARTH.**
==72== O, save me, Hubert, save me! My eyes are out
==73== Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.

**HUB.**
==74== Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.

**ARTH.**
==75== Alas, what need you be so boist’rous-rough?
==76== I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.
==77== For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
==78== Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
==79== And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
==80== I will not stir, nor winch, nor speak a word,
==81== Nor look upon the iron angerly.
==82== Thrust but these men away, and I’ll forgive you,
==83== What ever torment you do put me to.

**HUB.**
==84== Go stand within; let me alone with him.

**EXEC.**
==85== I am best pleas’d to be from such a deed.

*Exeunt Executioners.*

**ARTH.**
==86== Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
==87== He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart.
==88== Let him come back, that his compassion may
==89== Give life to yours.

**HUB.**
==89==            Come, boy, prepare yourself.

**ARTH.**
==90== Is there no remedy?

**HUB.**
==90==            None, but to lose your eyes.

**ARTH.**
==91== O heaven! That there were but a mote in yours,
==92== A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
==93== Any annoyance in that precious sense!
==94== Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,
==95== Your vild intent must needs seem horrible.

**HUB.**
==96== Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.

**ARTH.**
==97== Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
==98== Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.
==99== Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;
==100== Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
==101== So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,
==102== Though to no use but still to look on you!
==103== Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold,
==104== And would not harm me.

**HUB.**
==104==               I can heat it, boy.

**ARTH.**
==105== No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,
==106== Being create for comfort, to be us’d
==107== In undeserv’d extremes. See else yourself,
==108== There is no malice in this burning coal;
==109== The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out,
==110== And strew’d repentant ashes on his head.

**HUB.**
==111== But with my breath I can revive it, boy.

**ARTH.**
==112== And if you do, you will but make it blush
==113== And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.
==114== Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;
==115== And, like a dog that is compell’d to fight,
==116== Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
==117== All things that you should use to do me wrong
==118== Deny their office; only you do lack
==119== That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,
==120== Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.

**HUB.**
==121== Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
==122== For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.
==123== Yet am I sworn, and I did purpose, boy,
==124== With this same very iron to burn them out.

**ARTH.**
==125== O now you look like Hubert! All this while
==126== You were disguis’d.

**HUB.**
==126==            Peace; no more. *Adieu*.
==127== Your uncle must not know but you are dead.
==128== I’ll fill these dogged spies with false reports;
==129== And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure
==130== That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
==131== Will not offend thee.

**ARTH.**
==131==            O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.

**HUB.**
==132== Silence, no more. Go closely in with me;
==133== Much danger do I undergo for thee.

*Exeunt.*
