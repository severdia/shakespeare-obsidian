## Act 5, Scene 5
[[Act 5, Scene 4|← Act 5, Scene 4]] | [[Act 5, Scene 6|Act 5, Scene 6 →]]

*The French camp.*

*Enter Lewis the Dauphin and his Train.*

**LEW.**
==1== The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,
==2== But stay’d and made the western welkin blush,
==3== When English measure backward their own ground
==4== In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
==5== When with a volley of our needless shot,
==6== After such bloody toil, we bid good night,
==7== And wound our tott’ring colors clearly up,
==8== Last in the field, and almost lords of it!

*Enter a French Messenger.*

**FR. MESS.**
==9== Where is my prince, the Dauphin?

**LEW.**
==9==                   Here: what news?

**FR. MESS.**
==10== The Count Melune is slain; the English lords
==11== By his persuasion are again fall’n off,
==12== And your supply, which you have wish’d so long,
==13== Are cast away, and sunk on Goodwin Sands.

**LEW.**
==14== Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!
==15== I did not think to be so sad tonight
==16== As this hath made me. Who was he that said
==17== King John did fly an hour or two before
==18== The stumbling night did part our weary pow’rs?

**FR. MESS.**
==19== Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.

**LEW.**
==20== Well; keep good quarter and good care tonight;
==21== The day shall not be up so soon as I,
==22== To try the fair adventure of tomorrow.

*Exeunt.*
