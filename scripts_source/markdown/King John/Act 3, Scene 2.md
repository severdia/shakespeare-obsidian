## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*The plains near Angiers.*

*Alarums, excursions. Enter Bastard with Austria’s head.*

**BAST.**
Now by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
Some aery devil hovers in the sky
And pours down mischief. Austria’s head lie there,
While Philip breathes.

*Enter King John, Arthur, Hubert.*

**K. JOHN.**
Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up.
My mother is assailed in our tent,
And ta’en, I fear.

**BAST.**
           My lord, I rescued her;
Her Highness is in safety, fear you not.
But on, my liege, for very little pains
Will bring this labor to an happy end.

*Exeunt.*
