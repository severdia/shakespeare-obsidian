## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*The plains near Angiers.*

*Alarums, excursions. Enter Bastard with Austria’s head.*

**BAST.**
==1== Now by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
==2== Some aery devil hovers in the sky
==3== And pours down mischief. Austria’s head lie there,
==4== While Philip breathes.

*Enter King John, Arthur, Hubert.*

**K. JOHN.**
==5== Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up.
==6== My mother is assailed in our tent,
==7== And ta’en, I fear.

**BAST.**
==7==            My lord, I rescued her;
==8== Her Highness is in safety, fear you not.
==9== But on, my liege, for very little pains
==10== Will bring this labor to an happy end.

*Exeunt.*
