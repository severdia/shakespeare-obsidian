## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*King John’s Palace.*

*Enter King John and Pandulph, Attendants.*

**K. JOHN.**
==1== Thus have I yielded up into your hand
==2== The circle of my glory.

*Giving the crown.*

**PAND.**
==2==               Take again
==3== From this my hand, as holding of the Pope,
==4== Your sovereign greatness and authority.

**K. JOHN.**
==5== Now keep your holy word, go meet the French,
==6== And from his Holiness use all your power
==7== To stop their marches ’fore we are inflam’d.
==8== Our discontented counties do revolt;
==9== Our people quarrel with obedience,
==10== Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
==11== To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
==12== This inundation of mistemp’red humor
==13== Rests by you only to be qualified.
==14== Then pause not; for the present time’s so sick,
==15== That present med’cine must be minist’red,
==16== Or overthrow incurable ensues.

**PAND.**
==17== It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
==18== Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope;
==19== But since you are a gentle convertite,
==20== My tongue shall hush again this storm of war,
==21== And make fair weather in your blust’ring land.
==22== On this Ascension-day, remember well,
==23== Upon your oath of service to the Pope,
==24== Go I to make the French lay down their arms.

*Exit.*

**K. JOHN.**
==25== Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
==26== Say that before Ascension-day at noon
==27== My crown I should give off? Even so I have.
==28== I did suppose it should be on constraint,
==29== But (heav’n be thank’d!) it is but voluntary.

*Enter Bastard.*

**BAST.**
==30== All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
==31== But Dover castle. London hath receiv’d,
==32== Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers.
==33== Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
==34== To offer service to your enemy;
==35== And wild amazement hurries up and down
==36== The little number of your doubtful friends.

**K. JOHN.**
==37== Would not my lords return to me again
==38== After they heard young Arthur was alive?

**BAST.**
==39== They found him dead and cast into the streets,
==40== An empty casket, where the jewel of life
==41== By some damn’d hand was robb’d and ta’en away.

**K. JOHN.**
==42== That villain Hubert told me he did live.

**BAST.**
==43== So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
==44== But wherefore do you droop? Why look you sad?
==45== Be great in act, as you have been in thought.
==46== Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
==47== Govern the motion of a kingly eye.
==48== Be stirring as the time, be fire with fire,
==49== Threaten the threat’ner, and outface the brow
==50== Of bragging horror; so shall inferior eyes,
==51== That borrow their behaviors from the great,
==52== Grow great by your example and put on
==53== The dauntless spirit of resolution.
==54== Away, and glister like the god of war
==55== When he intendeth to become the field.
==56== Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
==57== What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
==58== And fright him there? And make him tremble there?
==59== O, let it not be said! Forage, and run
==60== To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
==61== And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.

**K. JOHN.**
==62== The legate of the Pope hath been with me,
==63== And I have made a happy peace with him,
==64== And he hath promis’d to dismiss the powers
==65== Led by the Dauphin.

**BAST.**
==65==            O inglorious league!
==66== Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
==67== Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
==68== Insinuation, parley, and base truce
==69== To arms invasive? Shall a beardless boy,
==70== A cock’red silken wanton, brave our fields,
==71== And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
==72== Mocking the air with colors idlely spread,
==73== And find no check? Let us, my liege, to arms.
==74== Perchance the Cardinal cannot make your peace;
==75== Or if he do, let it at least be said,
==76== They saw we had a purpose of defense.

**K. JOHN.**
==77== Have thou the ordering of this present time.

**BAST.**
==78== Away then with good courage! Yet I know
==79== Our party may well meet a prouder foe.

*Exeunt.*
