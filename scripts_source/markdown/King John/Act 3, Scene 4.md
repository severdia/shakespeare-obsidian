## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*The plains near Angiers. King Philip’s tent.*

*Enter King Philip of France, Lewis the Dauphin, Pandulph, Attendants.*

**K. PHI.**
==1==So by a roaring tempest on the flood,
==2==A whole armado of convicted sail
==3==Is scattered and disjoin’d from fellowship.

**PAND.**
==4==Courage and comfort! All shall yet go well.

**K. PHI.**
==5==What can go well, when we have run so ill?
==6==Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
==7==Arthur ta’en prisoner? Diverse dear friends slain?
==8==And bloody England into England gone,
==9==O’erbearing interruption, spite of France?

**LEW.**
==10==What he hath won, that hath he fortified.
==11==So hot a speed with such advice dispos’d,
==12==Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
==13==Doth want example. Who hath read or heard
==14==Of any kindred action like to this?

**K. PHI.**
==15==Well could I bear that England had this praise,
==16==So we could find some pattern of our shame.
*(Enter Constance.)*
==17==Look who comes here! A grave unto a soul,
==18==Holding th’ eternal spirit, against her will,
==19==In the vild prison of afflicted breath.
==20==I prithee, lady, go away with me.

**CONST.**
==21==Lo! Now! Now see the issue of your peace.

**K. PHI.**
==22==Patience, good lady, comfort, gentle Constance!

**CONST.**
==23==No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
==24==But that which ends all counsel, true redress:
==25==Death, death. O amiable lovely death!
==26==Thou odoriferous stench! Sound rottenness!
==27==Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
==28==Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
==29==And I will kiss thy detestable bones,
==30==And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows,
==31==And ring these fingers with thy household worms,
==32==And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust,
==33==And be a carrion monster like thyself.
==34==Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smil’st,
==35==And buss thee as thy wife. Misery’s love,
==36==O, come to me!

**K. PHI.**
==36==        O fair affliction, peace!

**CONST.**
==37==No, no, I will not, having breath to cry.
==38==O that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!
==39==Then with a passion would I shake the world,
==40==And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
==41==Which cannot hear a lady’s feeble voice,
==42==Which scorns a modern invocation.

**PAND.**
==43==Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.

**CONST.**
==44==Thou art not holy to belie me so,
==45==I am not mad. This hair I tear is mine,
==46==My name is Constance, I was Geffrey’s wife,
==47==Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost.
==48==I am not mad, I would to heaven I were!
==49==For then ’tis like I should forget myself.
==50==O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
==51==Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
==52==And thou shalt be canoniz’d, Cardinal;
==53==For, being not mad, but sensible of grief,
==54==My reasonable part produces reason
==55==How I may be deliver’d of these woes,
==56==And teaches me to kill or hang myself.
==57==If I were mad, I should forget my son,
==58==Or madly think a babe of clouts were he.
==59==I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
==60==The different plague of each calamity.

**K. PHI.**
==61==Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
==62==In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
==63==Where but by chance a silver drop hath fall’n,
==64==Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
==65==Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
==66==Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
==67==Sticking together in calamity.

**CONST.**
==68==To England, if you will.

**K. PHI.**
==68==              Bind up your hairs.

**CONST.**
==69==Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
==70==I tore them from their bonds, and cried aloud,
==71==“O that these hands could so redeem my son
==72==As they have given these hairs their liberty!”
==73==But now I envy at their liberty,
==74==And will again commit them to their bonds,
==75==Because my poor child is a prisoner.
==76==And, father Cardinal, I have heard you say
==77==That we shall see and know our friends in heaven.
==78==If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
==79==For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
==80==To him that did but yesterday suspire,
==81==There was not such a gracious creature born.
==82==But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud,
==83==And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
==84==And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
==85==As dim and meager as an ague’s fit,
==86==And so he’ll die; and rising so again,
==87==When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
==88==I shall not know him: therefore never, never
==89==Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

**PAND.**
==90==You hold too heinous a respect of grief.

**CONST.**
==91==He talks to me that never had a son.

**K. PHI.**
==92==You are as fond of grief as of your child.

**CONST.**
==93==Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
==94==Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
==95==Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
==96==Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
==97==Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
==98==Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
==99==Fare you well! Had you such a loss as I,
==100==I could give better comfort than you do.
==101==I will not keep this form upon my head
*(Tearing her hair.)*
==102==When there is such disorder in my wit.
==103==O Lord, my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
==104==My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!
==105==My widow-comfort, and my sorrows’ cure!

*Exit.*

**K. PHI.**
==106==I fear some outrage, and I’ll follow her.

*Exit.*

**LEW.**
==107==There’s nothing in this world can make me joy:
==108==Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
==109==Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
==110==And bitter shame hath spoil’d the sweet word’s taste,
==111==That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.

**PAND.**
==112==Before the curing of a strong disease,
==113==Even in the instant of repair and health,
==114==The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,
==115==On their departure most of all show evil.
==116==What have you lost by losing of this day?

**LEW.**
==117==All days of glory, joy, and happiness.

**PAND.**
==118==If you had won it, certainly you had.
==119==No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
==120==She looks upon them with a threat’ning eye.
==121==’Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
==122==In this which he accounts so clearly won.
==123==Are not you griev’d that Arthur is his prisoner?

**LEW.**
==124==As heartily as he is glad he hath him.

**PAND.**
==125==Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
==126==Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
==127==For even the breath of what I mean to speak
==128==Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
==129==Out of the path which shall directly lead
==130==Thy foot to England’s throne. And therefore mark:
==131==John hath seiz’d Arthur, and it cannot be
==132==That whiles warm life plays in that infant’s veins,
==133==The misplac’d John should entertain an hour,
==134==One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
==135==A scepter snatch’d with an unruly hand
==136==Must be as boisterously maintain’d as gain’d;
==137==And he that stands upon a slipp’ry place
==138==Makes nice of no vild hold to stay him up.
==139==That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall:
==140==So be it, for it cannot be but so.

**LEW.**
==141==But what shall I gain by young Arthur’s fall?

**PAND.**
==142==You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
==143==May then make all the claim that Arthur did.

**LEW.**
==144==And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.

**PAND.**
==145==How green you are and fresh in this old world!
==146==John lays you plots; the times conspire with you,
==147==For he that steeps his safety in true blood
==148==Shall find but bloody safety, and untrue.
==149==This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts
==150==Of all his people, and freeze up their zeal,
==151==That none so small advantage shall step forth
==152==To check his reign, but they will cherish it;
==153==No natural exhalation in the sky,
==154==No scope of nature, no distemper’d day,
==155==No common wind, no customed event,
==156==But they will pluck away his natural cause
==157==And call them meteors, prodigies, and signs,
==158==Abortives, presages, and tongues of heaven,
==159==Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.

**LEW.**
==160==May be he will not touch young Arthur’s life,
==161==But hold himself safe in his prisonment.

**PAND.**
==162==O sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
==163==If that young Arthur be not gone already,
==164==Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
==165==Of all his people shall revolt from him,
==166==And kiss the lips of unacquainted change,
==167==And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
==168==Out of the bloody fingers’ ends of John.
==169==Methinks I see this hurly all on foot;
==170==And O, what better matter breeds for you
==171==Than I have nam’d! The bastard Faulconbridge
==172==Is now in England ransacking the Church,
==173==Offending charity. If but a dozen French
==174==Were there in arms, they would be as a call
==175==To train ten thousand English to their side,
==176==Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
==177==Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
==178==Go with me to the King. ’Tis wonderful
==179==What may be wrought out of their discontent,
==180==Now that their souls are topful of offense.
==181==For England go; I will whet on the King.

**LEW.**
==182==Strong reasons makes strange actions. Let us go;
==183==If you say ay, the King will not say no.

*Exeunt.*
