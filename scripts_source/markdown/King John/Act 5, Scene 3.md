## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The battlefield.*

*Alarums. Enter King John and Hubert.*

**K. JOHN.**
How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.

**HUB.**
Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?

**K. JOHN.**
This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick!

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
Desires your Majesty to leave the field,
And send him word by me which way you go.

**K. JOHN.**
Tell him toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.

**MESS.**
Be of good comfort; for the great supply,
That was expected by the Dauphin here,
Are wrack’d three nights ago on Goodwin Sands;
This news was brought to Richard but even now.
The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.

**K. JOHN.**
Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up,
And will not let me welcome this good news.
Set on toward Swinstead. To my litter straight,
Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.

*Exeunt.*
