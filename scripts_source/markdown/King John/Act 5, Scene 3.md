[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*The battlefield.*

*Alarums. Enter King John and Hubert.*

**K. JOHN.**
==1== How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.

**HUB.**
==2== Badly, I fear. How fares your Majesty?

**K. JOHN.**
==3== This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
==4== Lies heavy on me. O, my heart is sick!

*Enter a Messenger.*

**MESS.**
==5== My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
==6== Desires your Majesty to leave the field,
==7== And send him word by me which way you go.

**K. JOHN.**
==8== Tell him toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.

**MESS.**
==9== Be of good comfort; for the great supply,
==10== That was expected by the Dauphin here,
==11== Are wrack’d three nights ago on Goodwin Sands;
==12== This news was brought to Richard but even now.
==13== The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.

**K. JOHN.**
==14== Ay me, this tyrant fever burns me up,
==15== And will not let me welcome this good news.
==16== Set on toward Swinstead. To my litter straight,
==17== Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.

*Exeunt.*
