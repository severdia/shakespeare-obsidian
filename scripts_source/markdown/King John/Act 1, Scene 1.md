## Act 1, Scene 1
[[+Dramatis Personae|← Dramatis Personae]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*A room in King John’s palace.*

*Enter King John, Queen Elinor, Pembroke, Essex, and Salisbury, with the Chatillon of France.*

**K. JOHN.**
==1==Now say, Chatillon, what would France with us?

**CHAT.**
==2==Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
==3==In my behavior to the majesty,
==4==The borrowed majesty, of England here.

**Q. EL.**
==5==A strange beginning: “borrowed majesty”!

**K. JOHN.**
==6==Silence, good mother, hear the embassy.

**CHAT.**
==7==Philip of France, in right and true behalf
==8==Of thy deceased brother Geffrey’s son,
==9==Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
==10==To this fair island and the territories,
==11==To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
==12==Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
==13==Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
==14==And put the same into young Arthur’s hand,
==15==Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.

**K. JOHN.**
==16==What follows if we disallow of this?

**CHAT.**
==17==The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
==18==To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.

**K. JOHN.**
==19==Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
==20==Controlment for controlment: so answer France.

**CHAT.**
==21==Then take my King’s defiance from my mouth,
==22==The farthest limit of my embassy.

**K. JOHN.**
==23==Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace.
==24==Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
==25==For ere thou canst report, I will be there;
==26==The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.
==27==So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath,
==28==And sullen presage of your own decay.
==29==An honorable conduct let him have.
==30==Pembroke, look to’t. Farewell, Chatillon.

*Exeunt Chatillon and Pembroke.*

**Q. EL.**
==31==What now, my son, have I not ever said
==32==How that ambitious Constance would not cease
==33==Till she had kindled France, and all the world,
==34==Upon the right and party of her son?
==35==This might have been prevented and made whole
==36==With very easy arguments of love,
==37==Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
==38==With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.

**K. JOHN.**
==39==Our strong possession and our right for us.

**Q. EL.**
==40==Your strong possession much more than your right,
==41==Or else it must go wrong with you and me;
==42==So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
==43==Which none but heaven, and you, and I, shall hear.

*Enter a Sheriff and whispers Essex in the ear.*

**ESSEX.**
==44==My liege, here is the strangest controversy
==45==Come from the country to be judg’d by you
==46==That e’er I heard. Shall I produce the men?

**K. JOHN.**
==47==Let them approach.
*(Exit Sheriff.)*
==48==Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
==49==This expedition’s charge.
*(Enter Robert Faulconbridge and Philip the Bastard.)*
==49==              What men are you?

**BAST.**
==50==Your faithful subject I, a gentleman,
==51==Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,
==52==As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
==53==A soldier, by the honor-giving hand
==54==Of Coeur de Lion knighted in the field.

**K. JOHN.**
==55==What art thou?

**ROB.**
==56==The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.

**K. JOHN.**
==57==Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
==58==You came not of one mother then, it seems.

**BAST.**
==59==Most certain of one mother, mighty King⁠—
==60==That is well known—and, as I think, one father;
==61==But for the certain knowledge of that truth
==62==I put you o’er to heaven and to my mother.
==63==Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may.

**Q. EL.**
==64==Out on thee, rude man, thou dost shame thy mother,
==65==And wound her honor with this diffidence.

**BAST.**
==66==I, madam? No, I have no reason for it;
==67==That is my brother’s plea and none of mine,
==68==The which if he can prove, ’a pops me out
==69==At least from fair five hundred pound a year.
==70==Heaven guard my mother’s honor, and my land!

**K. JOHN.**
==71==A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
==72==Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?

**BAST.**
==73==I know not why, except to get the land;
==74==But once he slander’d me with bastardy.
==75==But whe’er I be as true begot or no,
==76==That still I lay upon my mother’s head,
==77==But that I am as well begot, my liege
==78==(Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!),
==79==Compare our faces, and be judge yourself.
==80==If old Sir Robert did beget us both,
==81==And were our father, and this son like him,
==82==O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee
==83==I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

**K. JOHN.**
==84==Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!

**Q. EL.**
==85==He hath a trick of Coeur de Lion’s face,
==86==The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
==87==Do you not read some tokens of my son
==88==In the large composition of this man?

**K. JOHN.**
==89==Mine eye hath well examined his parts,
==90==And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
==91==What doth move you to claim your brother’s land?

**BAST.**
==92==Because he hath a half-face like my father!
==93==With half that face would he have all my land⁠—
==94==A half-fac’d groat five hundred pound a year!

**ROB.**
==95==My gracious liege, when that my father liv’d,
==96==Your brother did employ my father much⁠—

**BAST.**
==97==Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land;
==98==Your tale must be how he employ’d my mother.

**ROB.**
==99==And once dispatch’d him in an embassy
==100==To Germany, there with the Emperor
==101==To treat of high affairs touching that time.
==102==Th’ advantage of his absence took the King,
==103==And in the mean time sojourn’d at my father’s;
==104==Where how he did prevail I shame to speak.
==105==But truth is truth. Large lengths of seas and shores
==106==Between my father and my mother lay,
==107==As I have heard my father speak himself,
==108==When this same lusty gentleman was got.
==109==Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath’d
==110==His lands to me, and took it on his death
==111==That this my mother’s son was none of his;
==112==And if he were, he came into the world
==113==Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
==114==Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
==115==My father’s land, as was my father’s will.

**K. JOHN.**
==116==Sirrah, your brother is legitimate,
==117==Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him;
==118==And if she did play false, the fault was hers,
==119==Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
==120==That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
==121==Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
==122==Had of your father claim’d this son for his?
==123==In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
==124==This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;
==125==In sooth he might; then if he were my brother’s,
==126==My brother might not claim him, nor your father,
==127==Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes:
==128==My mother’s son did get your father’s heir;
==129==Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.

**ROB.**
==130==Shall then my father’s will be of no force
==131==To dispossess that child which is not his?

**BAST.**
==132==Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
==133==Than was his will to get me, as I think.

**Q. EL.**
==134==Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,
==135==And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land;
==136==Or the reputed son of Coeur de Lion,
==137==Lord of thy presence and no land beside?

**BAST.**
==138==Madam, and if my brother had my shape
==139==And I had his, Sir Robert’s his, like him,
==140==And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
==141==My arms such eel-skins stuff’d, my face so thin
==142==That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
==143==Lest men should say, “Look where three-farthings goes!”
==144==And to his shape were heir to all this land,
==145==Would I might never stir from off this place,
==146==I would give it every foot to have this face;
==147==It would not be Sir Nob in any case.

**Q. EL.**
==148==I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
==149==Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?
==150==I am a soldier, and now bound to France.

**BAST.**
==151==Brother, take you my land, I’ll take my chance.
==152==Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
==153==Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear.
==154==Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.

**Q. EL.**
==155==Nay, I would have you go before me thither.

**BAST.**
==156==Our country manners give our betters way.

**K. JOHN.**
==157==What is thy name?

**BAST.**
==158==Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
==159==Philip, good old Sir Robert’s wive’s eldest son.

**K. JOHN.**
==160==From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:
==161==Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
==162==Arise Sir Richard, and Plantagenet.

**BAST.**
==163==Brother by th’ mother’s side, give me your hand;
==164==My father gave me honor, yours gave land.
==165==Now blessed be the hour by night or day
==166==When I was got, Sir Robert was away!

**Q. EL.**
==167==The very spirit of Plantagenet!
==168==I am thy grandame, Richard, call me so.

**BAST.**
==169==Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?
==170==Something about, a little from the right,
==171==In at the window, or else o’er the hatch.
==172==Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
==173==And have is have, however men do catch.
==174==Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
==175==And I am I, howe’er I was begot.

**K. JOHN.**
==176==Go, Faulconbridge, now hast thou thy desire,
==177==A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
==178==Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
==179==For France, for France, for it is more than need.

**BAST.**
==180==Brother, *adieu*, good fortune come to thee!
==181==For thou wast got i’ th’ way of honesty.
*(Exeunt all but Bastard.)*
==182==A foot of honor better than I was,
==183==But many a many foot of land the worse.
==184==Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
==185==“Good den, Sir Richard!” “God-a-mercy, fellow!”
==186==And if his name be George, I’ll call him Peter;
==187==For new-made honor doth forget men’s names;
==188==’Tis too respective and too sociable
==189==For your conversion. Now your traveler,
==190==He and his toothpick at my worship’s mess,
==191==And when my knightly stomach is suffic’d,
==192==Why then I suck my teeth, and catechize
==193==My picked man of countries. “My dear sir,”
==194==Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
==195==“I shall beseech you”—that is question now;
==196==And then comes answer like an Absey book:
==197==“O sir,” says answer, “at your best command,
==198==At your employment, at your service, sir.”
==199==“No, sir,” says question, “I, sweet sir, at yours”;
==200==And so ere answer knows what question would,
==201==Saving in dialogue of compliment,
==202==And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
==203==The Pyrenean and the river Po,
==204==It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
==205==But this is worshipful society,
==206==And fits the mounting spirit like myself;
==207==For he is but a bastard to the time
==208==That doth not smack of observation⁠—
==209==And so am I, whether I smack or no;
==210==And not alone in habit and device,
==211==Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
==212==But from the inward motion to deliver
==213==Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth,
==214==Which though I will not practice to deceive,
==215==Yet to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
==216==For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
==217==But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
==218==What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband
==219==That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
*(Enter Lady Faulconbridge and James Gurney.)*
==220==O me, ’tis my mother. How now, good lady,
==221==What brings you here to court so hastily?

**L. FAULC.**
==222==Where is that slave, thy brother? Where is he,
==223==That holds in chase mine honor up and down?

**BAST.**
==224==My brother Robert, old Sir Robert’s son?
==225==Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
==226==Is it Sir Robert’s son that you seek so?

**L. FAULC.**
==227==Sir Robert’s son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
==228==Sir Robert’s son! Why scorn’st thou at Sir Robert?
==229==He is Sir Robert’s son, and so art thou.

**BAST.**
==230==James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave a while?

**GUR.**
==231==Good leave, good Philip.

**BAST.**
==231==              Philip? Sparrow! James,
==232==There’s toys abroad; anon I’ll tell thee more.
*(Exit James Gurney.)*
==233==Madam, I was not old Sir Robert’s son;
==234==Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
==235==Upon Good Friday and ne’er broke his fast.
==236==Sir Robert could do well—marry, to confess⁠—
==237==Could he get me. Sir Robert could not do it;
==238==We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,
==239==To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
==240==Sir Robert never help to make this leg.

**L. FAULC.**
==241==Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
==242==That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honor?
==243==What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?

**BAST.**
==244==Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
==245==What, I am dubb’d! I have it on my shoulder.
==246==But, mother, I am not Sir Robert’s son,
==247==I have disclaim’d Sir Robert and my land,
==248==Legitimation, name, and all is gone;
==249==Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
==250==Some proper man, I hope. Who was it, mother?

**L. FAULC.**
==251==Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?

**BAST.**
==252==As faithfully as I deny the devil.

**L. FAULC.**
==253==King Richard Coeur de Lion was thy father.
==254==By long and vehement suit I was seduc’d
==255==To make room for him in my husband’s bed.
==256==Heaven! Lay not my transgression to my charge,
==257==That art the issue of my dear offense,
==258==Which was so strongly urg’d past my defense.

**BAST.**
==259==Now by this light, were I to get again,
==260==Madam, I would not wish a better father.
==261==Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
==262==And so doth yours: your fault was not your folly;
==263==Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
==264==Subjected tribute to commanding love,
==265==Against whose fury and unmatched force
==266==The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
==267==Nor keep his princely heart from Richard’s hand.
==268==He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
==269==May easily win a woman’s. Ay, my mother,
==270==With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
==271==Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
==272==When I was got, I’ll send his soul to hell.
==273==Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin,
==274==And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
==275==If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin.
==276==Who says it was, he lies, I say ’twas not.

*Exeunt.*
