## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*The French King’s tent.*

*Enter Constance, Arthur, and Salisbury.*

**CONST.**
==1== Gone to be married? Gone to swear a peace?
==2== False blood to false blood join’d! Gone to be friends?
==3== Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
==4== It is not so, thou hast misspoke, misheard;
==5== Be well advis’d, tell o’er thy tale again.
==6== It cannot be, thou dost but say ’tis so.
==7== I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word
==8== Is but the vain breath of a common man.
==9== Believe me, I do not believe thee, man,
==10== I have a king’s oath to the contrary.
==11== Thou shalt be punish’d for thus frighting me,
==12== For I am sick and capable of fears,
==13== Oppress’d with wrongs, and therefore full of fears,
==14== A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
==15== A woman, naturally born to fears;
==16== And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
==17== With my vex’d spirits I cannot take a truce,
==18== But they will quake and tremble all this day.
==19== What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
==20== Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
==21== What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
==22== Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
==23== Like a proud river peering o’er his bounds?
==24== Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
==25== Then speak again, not all thy former tale,
==26== But this one word, whether thy tale be true.

**SAL.**
==27== As true as I believe you think them false
==28== That give you cause to prove my saying true.

**CONST.**
==29== O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
==30== Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
==31== And let belief and life encounter so
==32== As doth the fury of two desperate men,
==33== Which in the very meeting fall, and die.
==34== Lewis marry Blanch? O boy, then where art thou?
==35== France friend with England, what becomes of me?
==36== Fellow, be gone! I cannot brook thy sight,
==37== This news hath made thee a most ugly man.

**SAL.**
==38== What other harm have I, good lady, done,
==39== But spoke the harm that is by others done?

**CONST.**
==40== Which harm within itself so heinous is
==41== As it makes harmful all that speak of it.

**ARTH.**
==42== I do beseech you, madam, be content.

**CONST.**
==43== If thou that bid’st me be content wert grim,
==44== Ugly, and sland’rous to thy mother’s womb,
==45== Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
==46== Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
==47== Patch’d with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
==48== I would not care, I then would be content,
==49== For then I should not love thee; no, nor thou
==50== Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
==51== But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
==52== Nature and Fortune join’d to make thee great.
==53== Of Nature’s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
==54== And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
==55== She is corrupted, chang’d, and won from thee;
==56== Sh’ adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
==57== And with her golden hand hath pluck’d on France
==58== To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
==59== And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
==60== France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
==61== That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
==62== Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
==63== Envenom him with words, or get thee gone,
==64== And leave those woes alone, which I alone
==65== Am bound to underbear.

**SAL.**
==65==               Pardon me, madam,
==66== I may not go without you to the kings.

**CONST.**
==67== Thou mayst, thou shalt, I will not go with thee.
==68== I will instruct my sorrows to be proud,
==69== For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
==70== To me and to the state of my great grief
==71== Let kings assemble; for my grief’s so great
==72== That no supporter but the huge firm earth
==73== Can hold it up.
*(Throws herself on the ground.)*
==74== Here I and sorrows sit;
==75== Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.

*Enter King John, King Philip of France, Lewis the Dauphin, Blanch, Elinor, Philip the Bastard, Austria, and Attendants.*

**K. PHI.**
==76== ’Tis true, fair daughter, and this blessed day
==77== Ever in France shall be kept festival.
==78== To solemnize this day the glorious sun
==79== Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
==80== Turning with splendor of his precious eye
==81== The meager cloddy earth to glittering gold.
==82== The yearly course that brings this day about
==83== Shall never see it but a holy day.

**CONST.**
==84== A wicked day, and not a holy day!
*(Rising.)*
==85== What hath this day deserv’d? What hath it done,
==86== That it in golden letters should be set
==87== Among the high tides in the calendar?
==88== Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
==89== This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
==90== Or if it must stand still, let wives with child
==91== Pray that their burdens may not fall this day,
==92== Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross’d;
==93== But on this day let seamen fear no wrack;
==94== No bargains break that are not this day made:
==95== This day all things begun come to ill end,
==96== Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!

**K. PHI.**
==97== By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
==98== To curse the fair proceedings of this day.
==99== Have I not pawn’d to you my majesty?

**CONST.**
==100== You have beguil’d me with a counterfeit
==101== Resembling majesty, which being touch’d and tried,
==102== Proves valueless. You are forsworn, forsworn!
==103== You came in arms to spill mine enemies’ blood,
==104== But now in arms you strengthen it with yours.
==105== The grappling vigor and rough frown of war
==106== Is cold in amity and painted peace,
==107== And our oppression hath made up this league.
==108== Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjur’d kings!
==109== A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!
==110== Let not the hours of this ungodly day
==111== Wear out the day in peace; but ere sunset,
==112== Set armed discord ’twixt these perjur’d kings!
==113== Hear me, O, hear me!

**AUST.**
==113==               Lady Constance, peace!

**CONST.**
==114== War, war, no peace! Peace is to me a war.
==115== O Lymoges, O Austria! Thou dost shame
==116== That bloody spoil. Thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
==117== Thou little valiant, great in villainy!
==118== Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
==119== Thou Fortune’s champion that dost never fight
==120== But when her humorous ladyship is by
==121== To teach thee safety! Thou art perjur’d too,
==122== And sooth’st up greatness. What a fool art thou,
==123== A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
==124== Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
==125== Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side?
==126== Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
==127== Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength,
==128== And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
==129== Thou wear a lion’s hide! Doff it for shame,
==130== And hang a calve’s-skin on those recreant limbs.

**AUST.**
==131== O, that a man should speak those words to me!

**BAST.**
==132== And hang a calve’s-skin on those recreant limbs.

**AUST.**
==133== Thou dar’st not say so, villain, for thy life.

**BAST.**
==134== And hang a calve’s-skin on those recreant limbs.

**K. JOHN.**
==135== We like not this, thou dost forget thyself.

*Enter Pandulph.*

**K. PHI.**
==136== Here comes the holy legate of the Pope.

**PAND.**
==137== Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
==138== To thee, King John, my holy errand is:
==139== I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
==140== And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
==141== Do in his name religiously demand
==142== Why thou against the Church, our holy mother,
==143== So willfully dost spurn; and force perforce
==144== Keep Stephen Langton, chosen Archbishop
==145== Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
==146== This, in our foresaid Holy Father’s name,
==147== Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.

**K. JOHN.**
==148== What earthy name to interrogatories
==149== Can taste the free breath of a sacred king?
==150== Thou canst not, Cardinal, devise a name
==151== So slight, unworthy, and ridiculous,
==152== To charge me to an answer, as the Pope.
==153== Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England
==154== Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
==155== Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
==156== But as we, under God, are supreme head,
==157== So under Him that great supremacy,
==158== Where we do reign, we will alone uphold
==159== Without th’ assistance of a mortal hand.
==160== So tell the Pope, all reverence set apart
==161== To him and his usurp’d authority.

**K. PHI.**
==162== Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.

**K. JOHN.**
==163== Though you and all the kings of Christendom
==164== Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
==165== Dreading the curse that money may buy out,
==166== And by the merit of vild gold, dross, dust,
==167== Purchase corrupted pardon of a man
==168== Who in that sale sells pardon from himself;
==169== Though you, and all the rest so grossly led,
==170== This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
==171== Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
==172== Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes.

**PAND.**
==173== Then, by the lawful power that I have,
==174== Thou shalt stand curs’d and excommunicate,
==175== And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
==176== From his allegiance to an heretic,
==177== And meritorious shall that hand be call’d,
==178== Canonized and worshipp’d as a saint,
==179== That takes away by any secret course
==180== Thy hateful life.

**CONST.**
==180==            O, lawful let it be
==181== That I have room with Rome to curse a while!
==182== Good father Cardinal, cry thou amen
==183== To my keen curses; for without my wrong
==184== There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.

**PAND.**
==185== There’s law and warrant, lady, for my curse.

**CONST.**
==186== And for mine too: when law can do no right,
==187== Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong;
==188== Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
==189== For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
==190== Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong,
==191== How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?

**PAND.**
==192== Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
==193== Let go the hand of that arch-heretic,
==194== And raise the power of France upon his head,
==195== Unless he do submit himself to Rome.

**Q. EL.**
==196== Look’st thou pale, France? Do not let go thy hand.

**CONST.**
==197== Look to that, devil, lest that France repent,
==198== And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul.

**AUST.**
==199== King Philip, listen to the Cardinal.

**BAST.**
==200== And hang a calve’s-skin on his recreant limbs.

**AUST.**
==201== Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs,
==202== Because⁠—

**BAST.**
==202==     Your breeches best may carry them.

**K. JOHN.**
==203== Philip, what say’st thou to the Cardinal?

**CONST.**
==204== What should he say, but as the Cardinal?

**LEW.**
==205== Bethink you, father, for the difference
==206== Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
==207== Or the light loss of England for a friend.
==208== Forgo the easier.

**BLANCH.**
==208==            That’s the curse of Rome.

**CONST.**
==209== O Lewis, stand fast! The devil tempts thee here
==210== In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.

**BLANCH.**
==211== The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
==212== But from her need.

**CONST.**
==212==            O, if thou grant my need,
==213== Which only lives but by the death of faith,
==214== That need must needs infer this principle,
==215== That faith would live again by death of need.
==216== O then tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
==217== Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!

**K. JOHN.**
==218== The King is mov’d, and answers not to this.

**CONST.**
==219== O, be remov’d from him, and answer well!

**AUST.**
==220== Do so, King Philip, hang no more in doubt.

**BAST.**
==221== Hang nothing but a calve’s-skin, most sweet lout.

**K. PHI.**
==222== I am perplex’d, and know not what to say.

**PAND.**
==223== What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
==224== If thou stand excommunicate and curs’d?

**K. PHI.**
==225== Good reverend father, make my person yours,
==226== And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
==227== This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
==228== And the conjunction of our inward souls
==229== Married in league, coupled, and link’d together
==230== With all religious strength of sacred vows.
==231== The latest breath that gave the sound of words
==232== Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
==233== Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
==234== And even before this truce, but new before,
==235== No longer than we well could wash our hands
==236== To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
==237== Heaven knows they were besmear’d and over-stain’d
==238== With slaughter’s pencil—where revenge did paint
==239== The fearful difference of incensed kings⁠—
==240== And shall these hands, so lately purg’d of blood,
==241== So newly join’d in love, so strong in both,
==242== Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
==243== Play fast and loose with faith? So jest with heaven?
==244== Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
==245== As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
==246== Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
==247== Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
==248== And make a riot on the gentle brow
==249== Of true sincerity? O holy sir,
==250== My reverend father, let it not be so!
==251== Out of your grace devise, ordain, impose
==252== Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest
==253== To do your pleasure and continue friends.

**PAND.**
==254== All form is formless, order orderless,
==255== Save what is opposite to England’s love.
==256== Therefore to arms! Be champion of our Church,
==257== Or let the Church, our mother, breathe her curse,
==258== A mother’s curse, on her revolting son.
==259== France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
==260== A cased lion by the mortal paw,
==261== A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
==262== Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.

**K. PHI.**
==263== I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.

**PAND.**
==264== So mak’st thou faith an enemy to faith,
==265== And like a civil war set’st oath to oath,
==266== Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
==267== First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform’d,
==268== That is, to be the champion of our Church!
==269== What since thou swor’st is sworn against thyself,
==270== And may not be performed by thyself,
==271== For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
==272== Is not amiss when it is truly done;
==273== And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
==274== The truth is then most done not doing it.
==275== The better act of purposes mistook
==276== Is to mistake again; though indirect,
==277== Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
==278== And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
==279== Within the scorched veins of one new burn’d.
==280== It is religion that doth make vows kept,
==281== But thou hast sworn against religion,
==282== By what thou swear’st against the thing thou swear’st,
==283== And mak’st an oath the surety for thy truth
==284== Against an oath; the truth thou art unsure
==285== To swear, swears only not to be forsworn,
==286== Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
==287== But thou dost swear only to be forsworn,
==288== And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear;
==289== Therefore thy later vows, against thy first,
==290== Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
==291== And better conquest never canst thou make
==292== Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
==293== Against these giddy loose suggestions;
==294== Upon which better part our pray’rs come in,
==295== If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
==296== The peril of our curses light on thee
==297== So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
==298== But in despair die under their black weight.

**AUST.**
==299== Rebellion, flat rebellion!

**BAST.**
==299==               Will’t not be?
==300== Will not a calve’s-skin stop that mouth of thine?

**LEW.**
==301== Father, to arms!

**BLANCH.**
==301==            Upon thy wedding-day?
==302== Against the blood that thou hast married?
==303== What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men?
==304== Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
==305== Clamors of hell, be measures to our pomp?
==306== O husband, hear me! Ay, alack, how new
==307== Is “husband” in my mouth! Even for that name,
==308== Which till this time my tongue did ne’er pronounce,
==309== Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
==310== Against mine uncle.

**CONST.**
==310==            O, upon my knee,
==311== Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
==312== Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
==313== Forethought by heaven!

**BLANCH.**
==314== Now shall I see thy love. What motive may
==315== Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?

**CONST.**
==316== That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
==317== His honor. O, thine honor, Lewis, thine honor!

**LEW.**
==318== I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold,
==319== When such profound respects do pull you on.

**PAND.**
==320== I will denounce a curse upon his head.

**K. PHI.**
==321== Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.

**CONST.**
==322== O fair return of banish’d majesty!

**Q. EL.**
==323== O foul revolt of French inconstancy!

**K. JOHN.**
==324== France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.

**BAST.**
==325== Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time!
==326== Is it as he will? Well then, France shall rue.

**BLANCH.**
==327== The sun’s o’ercast with blood; fair day, *adieu*!
==328== Which is the side that I must go withal?
==329== I am with both, each army hath a hand,
==330== And in their rage, I having hold of both,
==331== They whirl asunder and dismember me.
==332== Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
==333== Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
==334== Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
==335== Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thrive:
==336== Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose;
==337== Assured loss before the match be play’d.

**LEW.**
==338== Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.

**BLANCH.**
==339== There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.

**K. JOHN.**
==340== Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
*(Exit Bastard.)*
==341== France, I am burn’d up with inflaming wrath,
==342== A rage whose heat hath this condition,
==343== That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
==344== The blood and dearest-valued blood of France.

**K. PHI.**
==345== Thy rage shall burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
==346== To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire.
==347== Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.

**K. JOHN.**
==348== No more than he that threats. To arms let’s hie!

*Exeunt.*
