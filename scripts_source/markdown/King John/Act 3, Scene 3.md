## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*The plains near Angiers.*

*Alarums, excursions, retreat. Enter King John, Elinor, Arthur, Bastard, Hubert, Lords.*

**K. JOHN.**
*(To Elinor.)*
==1==So shall it be; your Grace shall stay behind
==2==So strongly guarded.
*(To Arthur.)*
==2==           Cousin, look not sad,
==3==Thy grandame loves thee, and thy uncle will
==4==As dear be to thee as thy father was.

**ARTH.**
==5==O, this will make my mother die with grief!

**K. JOHN.**
*(To the Bastard.)*
==6==Cousin, away for England! Haste before,
==7==And ere our coming see thou shake the bags
==8==Of hoarding abbots, imprisoned angels
==9==Set at liberty. The fat ribs of peace
==10==Must by the hungry now be fed upon.
==11==Use our commission in his utmost force.

**BAST.**
==12==Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,
==13==When gold and silver becks me to come on.
==14==I leave your Highness. Grandame, I will pray
==15==(If ever I remember to be holy) 
==16==For your fair safety; so I kiss your hand.

**Q. EL.**
==17==Farewell, gentle cousin.

**K. JOHN.**
==17==              Coz, farewell.

*Exit Bastard.*

**Q. EL.**
==18==Come hither, little kinsman, hark, a word.

*Takes Arthur aside.*

**K. JOHN.**
==19==Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
==20==We owe thee much! Within this wall of flesh
==21==There is a soul counts thee her creditor,
==22==And with advantage means to pay thy love;
==23==And, my good friend, thy voluntary oath
==24==Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
==25==Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
==26==But I will fit it with some better time.
==27==By heaven, Hubert, I am almost asham’d
==28==To say what good respect I have of thee.

**HUB.**
==29==I am much bounden to your Majesty.

**K. JOHN.**
==30==Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
==31==But thou shalt have; and creep time ne’er so slow,
==32==Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
==33==I had a thing to say, but let it go.
==34==The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
==35==Attended with the pleasures of the world,
==36==Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
==37==To give me audience. If the midnight bell
==38==Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth
==39==Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
==40==If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
==41==And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
==42==Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
==43==Had bak’d thy blood and made it heavy, thick,
==44==Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
==45==Making that idiot, laughter, keep men’s eyes
==46==And strain their cheeks to idle merriment⁠—
==47==A passion hateful to my purposes;
==48==Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
==49==Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
==50==Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
==51==Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words⁠—
==52==Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
==53==I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts.
==54==But, ah, I will not! Yet I love thee well,
==55==And by my troth I think thou lov’st me well.

**HUB.**
==56==So well, that what you bid me undertake,
==57==Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
==58==By heaven, I would do it.

**K. JOHN.**
==58==              Do not I know thou wouldst?
==59==Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
==60==On yon young boy. I’ll tell thee what, my friend,
==61==He is a very serpent in my way,
==62==And wheresoe’er this foot of mine doth tread,
==63==He lies before me. Dost thou understand me?
==64==Thou art his keeper.

**HUB.**
==64==           And I’ll keep him so,
==65==That he shall not offend your Majesty.

**K. JOHN.**
==65==                         Death.

**HUB.**
==66==My lord?

**K. JOHN.**
==66==    A grave.

**HUB.**
==66==           He shall not live.

**K. JOHN.**
==66==                       Enough.
==67==I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee.
==68==Well, I’ll not say what I intend for thee.
==69==Remember. Madam, fare you well,
==70==I’ll send those powers o’er to your Majesty.

**Q. EL.**
==71==My blessing go with thee!

**K. JOHN.**
==71==              For England, cousin, go.
==72==Hubert shall be your man, attend on you
==73==With all true duty. On toward Callice, ho!

*Exeunt.*
