## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*The French camp at Saint Edmundsbury.*

*Enter, in arms, Lewis the Dauphin, Salisbury, Melune, Pembroke, Bigot, Soldiers.*

**LEW.**
==1==My Lord Melune, let this be copied out,
==2==And keep it safe for our remembrance.
==3==Return the president to these lords again,
==4==That having our fair order written down,
==5==Both they and we, perusing o’er these notes,
==6==May know wherefore we took the sacrament,
==7==And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.

**SAL.**
==8==Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
==9==And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
==10==A voluntary zeal and an unurg’d faith
==11==To your proceedings, yet believe me, Prince,
==12==I am not glad that such a sore of time
==13==Should seek a plaster by contemn’d revolt,
==14==And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
==15==By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
==16==That I must draw this metal from my side
==17==To be a widow-maker! O, and there
==18==Where honorable rescue and defense
==19==Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
==20==But such is the infection of the time,
==21==That for the health and physic of our right,
==22==We cannot deal but with the very hand
==23==Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
==24==And is’t not pity, O my grieved friends,
==25==That we, the sons and children of this isle,
==26==Were born to see so sad an hour as this,
==27==Wherein we step after a stranger, march
==28==Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
==29==Her enemies’ ranks—I must withdraw and weep
==30==Upon the spot of this enforced cause⁠—
==31==To grace the gentry of a land remote,
==32==And follow unacquainted colors here?
==33==What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
==34==That Neptune’s arms, who clippeth thee about,
==35==Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
==36==And gripple thee unto a pagan shore,
==37==Where these two Christian armies might combine
==38==The blood of malice in a vein of league,
==39==And not to spend it so unneighborly!

**LEW.**
==40==A noble temper dost thou show in this,
==41==And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
==42==Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
==43==O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
==44==Between compulsion and a brave respect!
==45==Let me wipe off this honorable dew,
==46==That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks.
==47==My heart hath melted at a lady’s tears,
==48==Being an ordinary inundation;
==49==But this effusion of such manly drops,
==50==This show’r, blown up by tempest of the soul,
==51==Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amaz’d
==52==Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
==53==Figur’d quite o’er with burning meteors.
==54==Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
==55==And with a great heart heave away this storm.
==56==Commend these waters to those baby eyes
==57==That never saw the giant world enrag’d,
==58==Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
==59==Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
==60==Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
==61==Into the purse of rich prosperity
==62==As Lewis himself; so, nobles, shall you all,
==63==That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
*(Enter Pandulph.)*
==64==And even there, methinks an angel spake.
==65==Look where the holy legate comes apace,
==66==To give us warrant from the hand of heaven,
==67==And on our actions set the name of right
==68==With holy breath.

**PAND.**
==68==           Hail, noble Prince of France!
==69==The next is this: King John hath reconcil’d
==70==Himself to Rome, his spirit is come in,
==71==That so stood out against the holy Church,
==72==The great metropolis and see of Rome;
==73==Therefore thy threat’ning colors now wind up,
==74==And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
==75==That like a lion fostered up at hand,
==76==It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
==77==And be no further harmful than in show.

**LEW.**
==78==Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not back.
==79==I am too high-born to be propertied,
==80==To be a secondary at control,
==81==Or useful servingman and instrument
==82==To any sovereign state throughout the world.
==83==Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
==84==Between this chastis’d kingdom and myself,
==85==And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
==86==And now ’tis far too huge to be blown out
==87==With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
==88==You taught me how to know the face of right,
==89==Acquainted me with interest to this land,
==90==Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart,
==91==And come ye now to tell me John hath made
==92==His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
==93==I, by the honor of my marriage-bed,
==94==After young Arthur, claim this land for mine,
==95==And now it is half conquer’d, must I back
==96==Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
==97==Am I Rome’s slave? What penny hath Rome borne?
==98==What men provided? What munition sent,
==99==To underprop this action? Is’t not I
==100==That undergo this charge? Who else but I,
==101==And such as to my claim are liable,
==102==Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
==103==Have I not heard these islanders shout out
==104==*“Vive le roi!”* as I have bank’d their towns?
==105==Have I not here the best cards for the game,
==106==To win this easy match play’d for a crown?
==107==And shall I now give o’er the yielded set?
==108==No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.

**PAND.**
==109==You look but on the outside of this work.

**LEW.**
==110==Outside or inside, I will not return
==111==Till my attempt so much be glorified
==112==As to my ample hope was promised
==113==Before I drew this gallant head of war,
==114==And cull’d these fiery spirits from the world,
==115==To outlook conquest and to win renown
==116==Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
*(Trumpet sounds.)*
==117==What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?

*Enter Bastard.*

**BAST.**
==118==According to the fair play of the world,
==119==Let me have audience. I am sent to speak:
==120==My holy Lord of Milan, from the King
==121==I come to learn how you have dealt for him;
==122==And, as you answer, I do know the scope
==123==And warrant limited unto my tongue.

**PAND.**
==124==The Dauphin is too willful-opposite,
==125==And will not temporize with my entreaties.
==126==He flatly says he’ll not lay down his arms.

**BAST.**
==127==By all the blood that ever fury breath’d,
==128==The youth says well. Now hear our English King,
==129==For thus his royalty doth speak in me:
==130==He is prepar’d, and reason too he should⁠—
==131==This apish and unmannerly approach,
==132==This harness’d masque and unadvised revel,
==133==This unhair’d sauciness and boyish troops,
==134==The King doth smile at, and is well prepar’d
==135==To whip this dwarfish war, this pigmy arms,
==136==From out the circle of his territories.
==137==That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
==138==To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
==139==To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
==140==To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
==141==To lie like pawns lock’d up in chests and trunks,
==142==To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
==143==In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
==144==Even at the crying of your nation’s crow,
==145==Thinking this voice an armed Englishman;
==146==Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
==147==That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
==148==No! Know the gallant monarch is in arms,
==149==And like an eagle o’er his aery tow’rs,
==150==To souse annoyance that comes near his nest;
==151==And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
==152==You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
==153==Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
==154==For your own ladies and pale-visag’d maids
==155==Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
==156==Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
==157==Their needl’s to lances, and their gentle hearts
==158==To fierce and bloody inclination.

**LEW.**
==159==There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
==160==We grant thou canst outscold us. Fare thee well!
==161==We hold our time too precious to be spent
==162==With such a brabbler.

**PAND.**
==162==           Give me leave to speak.

**BAST.**
==163==No, I will speak.

**LEW.**
==163==           We will attend to neither.
==164==Strike up the drums, and let the tongue of war
==165==Plead for our interest and our being here.

**BAST.**
==166==Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
==167==And so shall you, being beaten. Do but start
==168==An echo with the clamor of thy drum,
==169==And even at hand a drum is ready brac’d
==170==That shall reverberate all as loud as thine.
==171==Sound but another, and another shall
==172==(As loud as thine) rattle the welkin’s ear,
==173==And mock the deep-mouth’d thunder; for at hand
==174==(Not trusting to this halting legate here,
==175==Whom he hath us’d rather for sport than need) 
==176==Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
==177==A bare-ribb’d death, whose office is this day
==178==To feast upon whole thousands of the French.

**LEW.**
==179==Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.

**BAST.**
==180==And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.

*Exeunt.*
