## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A room in King John’s castle.*

*Enter King John, Pembroke, Salisbury, and other Lords.*

**K. JOHN.**
==1==Here once again we sit; once again crown’d,
==2==And look’d upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.

**PEM.**
==3==This “once again” (but that your Highness pleas’d) 
==4==Was once superfluous. You were crown’d before,
==5==And that high royalty was ne’er pluck’d off;
==6==The faiths of men ne’er stained with revolt;
==7==Fresh expectation troubled not the land
==8==With any long’d-for change or better state.

**SAL.**
==9==Therefore, to be possess’d with double pomp,
==10==To guard a title that was rich before,
==11==To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
==12==To throw a perfume on the violet,
==13==To smooth the ice, or add another hue
==14==Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
==15==To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
==16==Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.

**PEM.**
==17==But that your royal pleasure must be done,
==18==This act is as an ancient tale new told,
==19==And, in the last repeating, troublesome,
==20==Being urged at a time unseasonable.

**SAL.**
==21==In this the antique and well-noted face
==22==Of plain old form is much disfigured,
==23==And like a shifted wind unto a sail,
==24==It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
==25==Startles and frights consideration,
==26==Makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected,
==27==For putting on so new a fashion’d robe.

**PEM.**
==28==When workmen strive to do better than well,
==29==They do confound their skill in covetousness,
==30==And oftentimes excusing of a fault
==31==Doth make the fault the worse by th’ excuse:
==32==As patches set upon a little breach
==33==Discredit more in hiding of the fault
==34==Than did the fault before it was so patch’d.

**SAL.**
==35==To this effect, before you were new crown’d,
==36==We breath’d our counsel; but it pleas’d your Highness
==37==To overbear it, and we are all well pleas’d,
==38==Since all and every part of what we would
==39==Doth make a stand at what your Highness will.

**K. JOHN.**
==40==Some reasons of this double coronation
==41==I have possess’d you with, and think them strong;
==42==And more, more strong than lesser is my fear,
==43==I shall indue you with. Mean time but ask
==44==What you would have reform’d that is not well,
==45==And well shall you perceive how willingly
==46==I will both hear and grant you your requests.

**PEM.**
==47==Then I, as one that am the tongue of these
==48==To sound the purposes of all their hearts,
==49==Both for myself and them—but, chief of all,
==50==Your safety, for the which myself and them
==51==Bend their best studies—heartily request
==52==Th’ enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint
==53==Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
==54==To break into this dangerous argument:
==55==If what in rest you have in right you hold,
==56==Why then your fears, which (as they say) attend
==57==The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
==58==Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days
==59==With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth
==60==The rich advantage of good exercise.
==61==That the time’s enemies may not have this
==62==To grace occasions, let it be our suit
==63==That you have bid us ask his liberty,
==64==Which for our goods we do no further ask
==65==Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
==66==Counts it your weal he have his liberty.

*Enter Hubert.*

**K. JOHN.**
==67==Let it be so; I do commit his youth
==68==To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?

*Taking him aside.*

**PEM.**
==69==This is the man should do the bloody deed;
==70==He show’d his warrant to a friend of mine.
==71==The image of a wicked heinous fault
==72==Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
==73==Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast,
==74==And I do fearfully believe ’tis done,
==75==What we so fear’d he had a charge to do.

**SAL.**
==76==The color of the King doth come and go
==77==Between his purpose and his conscience,
==78==Like heralds ’twixt two dreadful battles set:
==79==His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.

**PEM.**
==80==And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
==81==The foul corruption of a sweet child’s death.

**K. JOHN.**
==82==We cannot hold mortality’s strong hand.
==83==Good lords, although my will to give is living,
==84==The suit which you demand is gone and dead.
==85==He tells us Arthur is deceas’d tonight.

**SAL.**
==86==Indeed we fear’d his sickness was past cure.

**PEM.**
==87==Indeed we heard how near his death he was
==88==Before the child himself felt he was sick.
==89==This must be answer’d either here or hence.

**K. JOHN.**
==90==Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
==91==Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
==92==Have I commandment on the pulse of life?

**SAL.**
==93==It is apparent foul play, and ’tis shame
==94==That greatness should so grossly offer it.
==95==So thrive it in your game! And so farewell.

**PEM.**
==96==Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I’ll go with thee,
==97==And find th’ inheritance of this poor child,
==98==His little kingdom of a forced grave.
==99==That blood which ow’d the breadth of all this isle,
==100==Three foot of it doth hold; bad world the while!
==101==This must not be thus borne. This will break out
==102==To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.

*Exeunt Lords.*

**K. JOHN.**
==103==They burn in indignation. I repent.
*(Enter Messenger.)*
==104==There is no sure foundation set on blood;
==105==No certain life achiev’d by others’ death.
==106==A fearful eye thou hast. Where is that blood
==107==That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
==108==So foul a sky clears not without a storm,
==109==Pour down thy weather. How goes all in France?

**MESS.**
==110==From France to England. Never such a pow’r
==111==For any foreign preparation
==112==Was levied in the body of a land.
==113==The copy of your speed is learn’d by them;
==114==For when you should be told they do prepare,
==115==The tidings comes that they are all arriv’d.

**K. JOHN.**
==116==O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
==117==Where hath it slept? Where is my mother’s care,
==118==That such an army could be drawn in France,
==119==And she not hear of it?

**MESS.**
==119==              My liege, her ear
==120==Is stopp’d with dust: the first of April died
==121==Your noble mother; and as I hear, my lord,
==122==The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
==123==Three days before; but this from rumor’s tongue
==124==I idly heard—if true or false I know not.

**K. JOHN.**
==125==Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
==126==O, make a league with me, till I have pleas’d
==127==My discontented peers! What? Mother dead?
==128==How wildly then walks my estate in France!
==129==Under whose conduct came those pow’rs of France
==130==That thou for truth giv’st out are landed here?

**MESS.**
==131==Under the Dauphin.

*Enter Bastard and Peter of Pomfret.*

**K. JOHN.**
==131==              Thou hast made me giddy
==132==With these ill tidings.—Now! What says the world
==133==To your proceedings? Do not seek to stuff
==134==My head with more ill news, for it is full.

**BAST.**
==135==But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
==136==Then let the worst unheard fall on your head.

**K. JOHN.**
==137==Bear with me, cousin, for I was amaz’d
==138==Under the tide; but now I breathe again
==139==Aloft the flood, and can give audience
==140==To any tongue, speak it of what it will.

**BAST.**
==141==How I have sped among the clergymen
==142==The sums I have collected shall express.
==143==But as I travel’d hither through the land,
==144==I find the people strangely fantasied,
==145==Possess’d with rumors, full of idle dreams,
==146==Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear.
==147==And here’s a prophet that I brought with me
==148==From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
==149==With many hundreds treading on his heels;
==150==To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
==151==That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
==152==Your Highness should deliver up your crown.

**K. JOHN.**
==153==Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?

**PET.**
==154==Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.

**K. JOHN.**
==155==Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
==156==And on that day at noon, whereon he says
==157==I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang’d.
==158==Deliver him to safety, and return,
==159==For I must use thee.
*(Exit Hubert with Peter.)*
==159==              O my gentle cousin,
==160==Hear’st thou the news abroad, who are arriv’d?

**BAST.**
==161==The French, my lord; men’s mouths are full of it.
==162==Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
==163==With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
==164==And others more, going to seek the grave
==165==Of Arthur, whom they say is kill’d tonight
==166==On your suggestion.

**K. JOHN.**
==166==           Gentle kinsman, go
==167==And thrust thyself into their companies;
==168==I have a way to win their loves again.
==169==Bring them before me.

**BAST.**
==169==              I will seek them out.

**K. JOHN.**
==170==Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
==171==O, let me have no subject enemies
==172==When adverse foreigners affright my towns
==173==With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
==174==Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
==175==And fly, like thought, from them to me again.

**BAST.**
==176==The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.

*Exit.*

**K. JOHN.**
==177==Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
==178==Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
==179==Some messenger betwixt me and the peers,
==180==And be thou he.

**MESS.**
==180==        With all my heart, my liege.

*Exit.*

**K. JOHN.**
==181==My mother dead!

*Enter Hubert.*

**HUB.**
==182==My lord, they say five moons were seen tonight;
==183==Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
==184==The other four in wondrous motion.

**K. JOHN.**
==185==Five moons?

**HUB.**
==185==        Old men and beldames in the streets
==186==Do prophesy upon it dangerously.
==187==Young Arthur’s death is common in their mouths,
==188==And when they talk of him, they shake their heads,
==189==And whisper one another in the ear;
==190==And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer’s wrist,
==191==Whilst he that hears makes fearful action
==192==With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
==193==I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
==194==The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
==195==With open mouth swallowing a tailor’s news,
==196==Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
==197==Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
==198==Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
==199==Told of a many thousand warlike French
==200==That were embattailed and rank’d in Kent.
==201==Another lean unwash’d artificer
==202==Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur’s death.

**K. JOHN.**
==203==Why seek’st thou to possess me with these fears?
==204==Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur’s death?
==205==Thy hand hath murd’red him. I had a mighty cause
==206==To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.

**HUB.**
==207==No had, my lord? Why, did you not provoke me?

**K. JOHN.**
==208==It is the curse of kings to be attended
==209==By slaves that take their humors for a warrant
==210==To break within the bloody house of life,
==211==And on the winking of authority
==212==To understand a law; to know the meaning
==213==Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
==214==More upon humor than advis’d respect.

**HUB.**
==215==Here is your hand and seal for what I did.

**K. JOHN.**
==216==O, when the last accompt ’twixt heaven and earth
==217==Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
==218==Witness against us to damnation!
==219==How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
==220==Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
==221==A fellow by the hand of nature mark’d,
==222==Quoted, and sign’d to do a deed of shame,
==223==This murder had not come into my mind;
==224==But taking note of thy abhorr’d aspect,
==225==Finding thee fit for bloody villainy,
==226==Apt, liable to be employ’d in danger,
==227==I faintly broke with thee of Arthur’s death;
==228==And thou, to be endeared to a king,
==229==Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.

**HUB.**
==230==My lord⁠—

**K. JOHN.**
==231==Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
==232==When I spake darkly what I purposed,
==233==Or turn’d an eye of doubt upon my face,
==234==As bid me tell my tale in express words,
==235==Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
==236==And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.
==237==But thou didst understand me by my signs,
==238==And didst in signs again parley with sin,
==239==Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
==240==And consequently thy rude hand to act
==241==The deed, which both our tongues held vild to name.
==242==Out of my sight, and never see me more!
==243==My nobles leave me, and my state is braved,
==244==Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign pow’rs;
==245==Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
==246==This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
==247==Hostility and civil tumult reigns
==248==Between my conscience and my cousin’s death.

**HUB.**
==249==Arm you against your other enemies,
==250==I’ll make a peace between your soul and you.
==251==Young Arthur is alive. This hand of mine
==252==Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
==253==Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
==254==Within this bosom never ent’red yet
==255==The dreadful motion of a murderous thought,
==256==And you have slander’d nature in my form,
==257==Which howsoever rude exteriorly,
==258==Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
==259==Than to be butcher of an innocent child.

**K. JOHN.**
==260==Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
==261==Throw this report on their incensed rage,
==262==And make them tame to their obedience!
==263==Forgive the comment that my passion made
==264==Upon thy feature, for my rage was blind,
==265==And foul imaginary eyes of blood
==266==Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
==267==O, answer not! But to my closet bring
==268==The angry lords with all expedient haste.
==269==I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.

*Exeunt.*
