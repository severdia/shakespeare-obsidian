## Act 5, Scene 6
[[Act 5, Scene 5|← Act 5, Scene 5]] | [[Act 5, Scene 7|Act 5, Scene 7 →]]

*An open place in the neighborhood of Swinstead Abbey.*

*Enter Bastard and Hubert severally.*

**HUB.**
==1==Who’s there? Speak ho! Speak quickly, or I shoot.

**BAST.**
==2==A friend. What art thou?

**HUB.**
==2==              Of the part of England.

**BAST.**
==3==Whither dost thou go?

**HUB.**
==4==What’s that to thee? Why may not I demand
==5==Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?

**BAST.**
==6==Hubert, I think.

**HUB.**
==6==        Thou hast a perfect thought.
==7==I will upon all hazards well believe
==8==Thou art my friend that know’st my tongue so well.
==9==Who art thou?

**BAST.**
==9==        Who thou wilt; and if thou please,
==10==Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
==11==I come one way of the Plantagenets.

**HUB.**
==12==Unkind remembrance! Thou and endless night
==13==Have done me shame. Brave soldier, pardon me
==14==That any accent breaking from thy tongue
==15==Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.

**BAST.**
==16==Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?

**HUB.**
==17==Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
==18==To find you out.

**BAST.**
==18==        Brief then; and what’s the news?

**HUB.**
==19==O my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
==20==Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.

**BAST.**
==21==Show me the very wound of this ill news;
==22==I am no woman, I’ll not swound at it.

**HUB.**
==23==The King, I fear, is poison’d by a monk.
==24==I left him almost speechless, and broke out
==25==To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
==26==The better arm you to the sudden time
==27==Than if you had at leisure known of this.

**BAST.**
==28==How did he take it? Who did taste to him?

**HUB.**
==29==A monk, I tell you, a resolved villain,
==30==Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King
==31==Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.

**BAST.**
==32==Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?

**HUB.**
==33==Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,
==34==And brought Prince Henry in their company,
==35==At whose request the King hath pardon’d them,
==36==And they are all about his Majesty.

**BAST.**
==37==Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
==38==And tempt us not to bear above our power!
==39==I’ll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,
==40==Passing these flats, are taken by the tide⁠—
==41==These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
==42==Myself, well mounted, hardly have escap’d.
==43==Away before; conduct me to the King;
==44==I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.

*Exeunt.*
