## Act 5, Scene 3
[[Act 5, Scene 2|← Act 5, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 4|Act 5, Scene 4 →]]

*A place near the Lists.*

*Flourish. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous, and some Attendants.*

**EMIL.**
==1==I’ll no step further.

**PIR.**
==1==           Will you lose this sight?

**EMIL.**
==2==I had rather see a wren hawk at a fly
==3==Than this decision. Ev’ry blow that falls
==4==Threats a brave life, each stroke laments
==5==The place whereon it falls, and sounds more like
==6==A bell than blade. I will stay here,
==7==It is enough my hearing shall be punish’d
==8==With what shall happen—’gainst the which there is
==9==No deafing—but to hear, not taint mine eye
==10==With dread sights it may shun.

**PIR.**
==10==                Sir, my good lord,
==11==Your sister will no further.

**THE.**
==11==              O, she must.
==12==She shall see deeds of honor in their kind
==13==Which sometime show well, pencill’d. Nature now
==14==Shall make and act the story, the belief
==15==Both seal’d with eye and ear. You must be present,
==16==You are the victor’s meed, the price and garland
==17==To crown the question’s title.

**EMIL.**
==17==                Pardon me,
==18==If I were there, I’ld wink.

**THE.**
==18==              You must be there;
==19==This trial is as ’twere i’ th’ night, and you
==20==The only star to shine.

**EMIL.**
==20==              I am extinct,
==21==There is but envy in that light which shows
==22==The one the other. Darkness, which ever was
==23==The dam of Horror, who does stand accurs’d
==24==Of many mortal millions, may even now,
==25==By casting her black mantle over both,
==26==That neither could find other, get herself
==27==Some part of a good name, and many a murder
==28==Set off whereto she’s guilty.

**HIP.**
==28==                You must go.

**EMIL.**
==29==In faith, I will not.

**THE.**
==29==           Why, the knights must kindle
==30==Their valor at your eye. Know, of this war
==31==You are the treasure, and must needs be by
==32==To give the service pay.

**EMIL.**
==32==              Sir, pardon me,
==33==The title of a kingdom may be tried
==34==Out of itself.

**THE.**
==34==        Well, well then, at your pleasure.
==35==Those that remain with you could wish their office
==36==To any of their enemies.

**HIP.**
==36==              Farewell, sister,
==37==I am like to know your husband ’fore yourself
==38==By some small start of time. He whom the gods
==39==Do of the two know best, I pray them he
==40==Be made your lot.

*Exeunt Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, etc.*

**EMIL.**
==41==Arcite is gently visag’d; yet his eye
==42==Is like an engine bent, or a sharp weapon
==43==In a soft sheath; mercy and manly courage
==44==Are bedfellows in his visage. Palamon
==45==Has a most menacing aspect, his brow
==46==Is grav’d, and seems to bury what it frowns on,
==47==Yet sometime ’tis not so, but alters to
==48==The quality of his thoughts; long time his eye
==49==Will dwell upon his object; melancholy
==50==Becomes him nobly. So does Arcite’s mirth,
==51==But Palamon’s sadness is a kind of mirth,
==52==So mingled as if mirth did make him sad,
==53==And sadness merry; those darker humors that
==54==Stick misbecomingly on others, on him
==55==Live in fair dwelling.
*(Cornets. Trumpets sound as to a charge.)*
==56==Hark how yon spurs to spirit do incite
==57==The princes to their proof! Arcite may win me,
==58==And yet may Palamon wound Arcite to
==59==The spoiling of his figure. O, what pity
==60==Enough for such a chance? If I were by,
==61==I might do hurt, for they would glance their eyes
==62==Toward my seat, and in that motion might
==63==Omit a ward, or forfeit an offense,
==64==Which crav’d that very time. It is much better
==65==I am not there. O, better never born
==66==Than minister to such harm!
*(Cornets. A great cry and noise within, crying “A Palamon!” )*
*(Enter Servant.)*
==66==                What is the chance?

**SERV.**
==67==The cry’s “A Palamon!”

**EMIL.**
==68==Then he has won. ’Twas ever likely:
==69==He look’d all grace and success, and he is
==70==Doubtless the prim’st of men. I prithee run
==71==And tell me how it goes.

*Shout and cornets. Crying “A Palamon!” within.*

**SERV.**
==72==Still “Palamon!”

**EMIL.**
==73==Run and inquire.
*(Exit Servant.)*
==73==           Poor servant, thou hast lost.
==74==Upon my right side still I wore thy picture,
==75==Palamon’s on the left. Why so, I know not;
==76==I had no end in’t else; chance would have it so.
==77==On the sinister side the heart lies; Palamon
==78==Had the best-boding chance.
*(Another cry, and shout within, and cornets.)*
==78==                This burst of clamor
==79==Is sure th’ end o’ th’ combat.

*Enter Servant.*

**SERV.**
==80==They said that Palamon had Arcite’s body
==81==Within an inch o’ th’ pyramid, that the cry
==82==Was general “A Palamon!”; but anon
==83==Th’ assistants made a brave redemption, and
==84==The two bold titlers at this instant are
==85==Hand to hand at it.

**EMIL.**
==85==           Were they metamorphis’d
==86==Both into one—O why? There were no woman
==87==Worth so compos’d a man! Their single share,
==88==Their nobleness peculiar to them, gives
==89==The prejudice of disparity, value’s shortness,
==90==To any lady breathing.
*(Cornets. Cry within, “Arcite, Arcite!” )*
==90==              More exulting?
==91==“Palamon” still?

**SERV.**
==91==        Nay, now the sound is “Arcite.”

**EMIL.**
==92==I prithee lay attention to the cry;
==93==Set both thine ears to th’ business.

*Cornets. A great shout and cry, “Arcite! Victory!” *

**SERV.**
==93==                  The cry is
==94==“Arcite!” and “victory!” Hark, “Arcite! Victory!”
==95==The combat’s consummation is proclaim’d
==96==By the wind instruments.

**EMIL.**
==96==              Half-sights saw
==97==That Arcite was no babe. God’s lid, his richness
==98==And costliness of spirit look’d through him, it could
==99==No more be hid in him than fire in flax,
==100==Than humble banks can go to law with waters
==101==That drift-winds force to raging. I did think
==102==Good Palamon would miscarry, yet I knew not
==103==Why I did think so. Our reasons are not prophets
==104==When oft our fancies are. They are coming off.
==105==Alas, poor Palamon!

*Cornets.*

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Arcite as victor, and Attendants, etc.*

**THE.**
==106==Lo, where our sister is in expectation,
==107==Yet quaking and unsettled. Fairest Emily,
==108==The gods by their divine arbitrement
==109==Have given you this knight: he is a good one
==110==As ever struck at head. Give me your hands.
==111==Receive you her, you him, be plighted with
==112==A love that grows as you decay.

**ARC.**
==112==                  Emily,
==113==To buy you I have lost what’s dearest to me
==114==Save what is bought, and yet I purchase cheaply,
==115==As I do rate your value.

**THE.**
==115==              O loved sister,
==116==He speaks now of as brave a knight as e’er
==117==Did spur a noble steed. Surely the gods
==118==Would have him die a bachelor, lest his race
==119==Should show i’ th’ world too godlike. His behavior
==120==So charm’d me that methought Alcides was
==121==To him a sow of lead. If I could praise
==122==Each part of him to th’ all I have spoke, your Arcite
==123==Did not lose by’t; for he that was thus good
==124==Encount’red yet his better. I have heard
==125==Two emulous Philomels beat the ear o’ th’ night
==126==With their contentious throats, now one the higher,
==127==Anon the other, then again the first,
==128==And by and by out-breasted, that the sense
==129==Could not be judge between ’em. So it far’d
==130==Good space between these kinsmen; till heavens did
==131==Make hardly one the winner.—Wear the girlond
==132==With joy that you have won.—For the subdu’d,
==133==Give them our present justice, since I know
==134==Their lives but pinch ’em. Let it here be done.
==135==The scene’s not for our seeing, go we hence,
==136==Right joyful, with some sorrow.—Arm your prize,
==137==I know you will not loose her.—Hippolyta,
==138==I see one eye of yours conceives a tear,
==139==The which it will deliver.

**EMIL.**
==139==              Is this winning?
==140==O all you heavenly powers, where is your mercy?
==141==But that your wills have said it must be so,
==142==And charge me live to comfort this unfriended,
==143==This miserable prince, that cuts away
==144==A life more worthy from him than all women,
==145==I should and would die too.

**HIP.**
==145==                Infinite pity
==146==That four such eyes should be so fix’d on one
==147==That two must needs be blind for’t!

**THE.**
==147==                     So it is.

*Flourish. Exeunt*
