## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 1, Scene 3|Act 1, Scene 3 →]]

*Thebes. The palace.*

*Enter Palamon and Arcite.*

**ARC.**
==1== Dear Palamon, dearer in love than blood,
==2== And our prime cousin, yet unhard’ned in
==3== The crimes of nature—let us leave the city
==4== Thebes, and the temptings in’t, before we further
==5== Sully our gloss of youth:
==6== And here to keep in abstinence we shame
==7== As in incontinence; for not to swim
==8== I’ th’ aid o’ th’ current were almost to sink,
==9== At least to frustrate striving, and to follow
==10== The common stream, ’twould bring us to an eddy
==11== Where we should turn or drown; if labor through,
==12== Our gain but life and weakness.

**PAL.**
==12==                   Your advice
==13== Is cried up with example. What strange ruins,
==14== Since first we went to school, may we perceive
==15== Walking in Thebes! Scars and bare weeds
==16== The gain o’ th’ martialist, who did propound
==17== To his bold ends honor and golden ingots,
==18== Which though he won, he had not; and now flurted
==19== By peace, for whom he fought, who then shall offer
==20== To Mars’s so scorn’d altar? I do bleed
==21== When such I meet, and wish great Juno would
==22== Resume her ancient fit of jealousy
==23== To get the soldier work, that peace might purge
==24== For her repletion, and retain anew
==25== Her charitable heart, now hard, and harsher
==26== Than strife or war could be.

**ARC.**
==26==                 Are you not out?
==27== Meet you no ruin but the soldier in
==28== The cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin
==29== As if you met decays of many kinds.
==30== Perceive you none that do arouse your pity
==31== But th’ unconsider’d soldier?

**PAL.**
==31==                 Yes, I pity
==32== Decays where e’er I find them, but such most
==33== That sweating in an honorable toil
==34== Are paid with ice to cool ’em.

**ARC.**
==34==                   ’Tis not this
==35== I did begin to speak of. This is virtue
==36== Of no respect in Thebes. I spake of Thebes,
==37== How dangerous, if we will keep our honors,
==38== It is for our residing; where every evil
==39== Hath a good color; where ev’ry seeming good’s
==40== A certain evil; where not to be ev’n jump
==41== As they are, here were to be strangers, and
==42== Such things to be, mere monsters.

**PAL.**
==42==                   ’Tis in our power
==43== (Unless we fear that apes can tutor’s) to
==44== Be masters of our manners. What need I
==45== Affect another’s gait, which is not catching
==46== Where there is faith? Or to be fond upon
==47== Another’s way of speech, when by mine own
==48== I may be reasonably conceiv’d; sav’d too,
==49== Speaking it truly? Why am I bound
==50== By any generous bond to follow him
==51== Follows his tailor, haply so long until
==52== The follow’d make pursuit? Or let me know
==53== Why mine own barber is unblest, with him
==54== My poor chin too, for ’tis not scissor’d just
==55== To such a favorite’s glass? What canon is there
==56== That does command my rapier from my hip,
==57== To dangle’t in my hand, or to go tiptoe
==58== Before the street be foul? Either I am
==59== The forehorse in the team, or I am none
==60== That draw i’ th’ sequent trace. These poor slight sores
==61== Need not a plantin; that which rips my bosom
==62== Almost to th’ heart’s⁠—

**ARC.**
==62==            Our uncle Creon.

**PAL.**
==62==                          He,
==63== A most unbounded tyrant, whose successes
==64== Makes heaven unfear’d, and villainy assured
==65== Beyond its power there’s nothing; almost puts
==66== Faith in a fever, and deifies alone
==67== Voluble chance; who only attributes
==68== The faculties of other instruments
==69== To his own nerves and act; commands men service,
==70== And what they win in’t, boot and glory; one
==71== That fears not to do harm; good, dares not. Let
==72== The blood of mine that’s sib to him be suck’d
==73== From me with leeches! Let them break and fall
==74== Off me with that corruption!

**ARC.**
==74==                 Clear-spirited cousin,
==75== Let’s leave his court, that we may nothing share
==76== Of his loud infamy; for our milk
==77== Will relish of the pasture, and we must
==78== Be vile, or disobedient—not his kinsmen
==79== In blood unless in quality.

**PAL.**
==79==               Nothing truer.
==80== I think the echoes of his shames have deaf’d
==81== The ears of heav’nly justice. Widows’ cries
==82== Descend again into their throats, and have not
==83== Due audience of the gods.
*(Enter Valerius.)*
==83==               Valerius!

**VAL.**
==84== The King calls for you; yet be leaden-footed
==85== Till his great rage be off him. Phoebus, when
==86== He broke his whipstock and exclaim’d against
==87== The horses of the sun, but whisper’d, to
==88== The loudness of his fury.

**PAL.**
==88==               Small winds shake him.
==89== But what’s the matter?

**VAL.**
==90== Theseus (who where he threats appalls) hath sent
==91== Deadly defiance to him, and pronounces
==92== Ruin to Thebes; who is at hand to seal
==93== The promise of his wrath.

**ARC.**
==93==               Let him approach.
==94== But that we fear the gods in him, he brings not
==95== A jot of terror to us. Yet what man
==96== Thirds his own worth (the case is each of ours),
==97== When that his action’s dregg’d with mind assur’d
==98== ’Tis bad he goes about.

**PAL.**
==98==               Leave that unreason’d.
==99== Our services stand now for Thebes, not Creon.
==100== Yet to be neutral to him were dishonor;
==101== Rebellious to oppose; therefore we must
==102== With him stand to the mercy of our fate,
==103== Who hath bounded our last minute.

**ARC.**
==103==                   So we must.
==104== Is’t said this war’s afoot? Or it shall be,
==105== On fail of some condition?

**VAL.**
==105==               ’Tis in motion,
==106== The intelligence of state came in the instant
==107== With the defier.

**PAL.**
==107==            Let’s to the King, who were he
==108== A quarter carrier of that honor which
==109== His enemy come in, the blood we venture
==110== Should be as for our health, which were not spent,
==111== Rather laid out for purchase. But alas,
==112== Our hands advanc’d before our hearts, what will
==113== The fall o’ th’ stroke do damage?

**ARC.**
==113==                   Let th’ event,
==114== That never-erring arbitrator, tell us
==115== When we know all ourselves, and let us follow
==116== The becking of our chance.

*Exeunt.*
