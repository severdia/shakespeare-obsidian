## Act 2, Scene 2
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 3|Act 2, Scene 3 →]]

*The prison.*

*Enter Palamon, and Arcite in prison.*

**PAL.**
==1==How do you, noble cousin?

**ARC.**
==1==                How do you, sir?

**PAL.**
==2==Why, strong enough to laugh at misery
==3==And bear the chance of war yet. We are prisoners
==4==I fear forever, cousin.

**ARC.**
==4==           I believe it,
==5==And to that destiny have patiently
==6==Laid up my hour to come.

**PAL.**
==6==                O cousin Arcite,
==7==Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?
==8==Where are our friends and kindreds? Never more
==9==Must we behold those comforts, never see
==10==The hardy youths strive for the games of honor,
==11==Hung with the painted favors of their ladies,
==12==Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst ’em
==13==And as an east wind leave ’em all behind us,
==14==Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,
==15==Even in the wagging of a wanton leg,
==16==Outstripp’d the people’s praises, won the garlands,
==17==Ere they have time to wish ’em ours. O, never
==18==Shall we two exercise, like twins of honor,
==19==Our arms again, and feel our fiery horses
==20==Like proud seas under us. Our good swords now
==21==(Better the red-ey’d god of war nev’r ware),
==22==Ravish’d our sides, like age must run to rust,
==23==And deck the temples of those gods that hate us;
==24==These hands shall never draw ’em out like lightning
==25==To blast whole armies more.

**ARC.**
==25==                No, Palamon,
==26==Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,
==27==And here the graces of our youths must wither
==28==Like a too-timely spring. Here age must find us,
==29==And which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried.
==30==The sweet embraces of a loving wife,
==31==Loaden with kisses, arm’d with thousand Cupids,
==32==Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us;
==33==No figures of ourselves shall we ev’r see
==34==To glad our age, and like young eagles teach ’em
==35==Boldly to gaze against bright arms, and say,
==36==“Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!”
==37==The fair-ey’d maids shall weep our banishments,
==38==And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune
==39==Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done
==40==To youth and nature. This is all our world:
==41==We shall know nothing here but one another,
==42==Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes;
==43==The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;
==44==Summer shall come, and with her all delights,
==45==But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.

**PAL.**
==46==’Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds,
==47==That shook the aged forest with their echoes,
==48==No more now must we hallow; no more shake
==49==Our pointed javelins, whilst the angry swine
==50==Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,
==51==Struck with our well-steel’d darts. All valiant uses
==52==(The food and nourishment of noble minds) 
==53==In us two here shall perish; we shall die
==54==(Which is the curse of honor) lastly
==55==Children of grief and ignorance.

**ARC.**
==55==                  Yet, cousin,
==56==Even from the bottom of these miseries,
==57==From all that fortune can inflict upon us,
==58==I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,
==59==If the gods please—to hold here a brave patience,
==60==And the enjoying of our griefs together.
==61==Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish
==62==If I think this our prison.

**PAL.**
==62==              Certainly
==63==’Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes
==64==Were twin’d together. ’Tis most true, two souls
==65==Put in two noble bodies, let ’em suffer
==66==The gall of hazard, so they grow together,
==67==Will never sink; they must not, say they could;
==68==A willing man dies sleeping, and all’s done.

**ARC.**
==69==Shall we make worthy uses of this place
==70==That all men hate so much?

**PAL.**
==70==                How, gentle cousin?

**ARC.**
==71==Let’s think this prison holy sanctuary
==72==To keep us from corruption of worse men.
==73==We are young and yet desire the ways of honor,
==74==That liberty and common conversation,
==75==The poison of pure spirits, might, like women,
==76==Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing
==77==Can be, but our imaginations
==78==May make it ours? And here being thus together,
==79==We are an endless mine to one another;
==80==We are one another’s wife, ever begetting
==81==New births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance;
==82==We are, in one another, families:
==83==I am your heir, and you are mine; this place
==84==Is our inheritance. No hard oppressor
==85==Dare take this from us; here with a little patience
==86==We shall live long, and loving. No surfeits seek us;
==87==The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas
==88==Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty,
==89==A wife might part us lawfully, or business,
==90==Quarrels consume us, envy of ill men
==91==Crave our acquaintance; I might sicken, cousin,
==92==Where you should never know it, and so perish
==93==Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,
==94==Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,
==95==Were we from hence, would sever us.

**PAL.**
==95==                     You have made me
==96==(I thank you, cousin Arcite) almost wanton
==97==With my captivity. What a misery
==98==It is to live abroad, and every where!
==99==’Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,
==100==I am sure, a more content, and all those pleasures
==101==That woo the wills of men to vanity
==102==I see through now, and am sufficient
==103==To tell the world ’tis but a gaudy shadow
==104==That old Time, as he passes by, takes with him.
==105==What had we been, old in the court of Creon,
==106==Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance
==107==The virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,
==108==Had not the loving gods found this place for us,
==109==We had died as they do, ill old men, unwept,
==110==And had their epitaphs, the people’s curses.
==111==Shall I say more?

**ARC.**
==111==           I would hear you still.

**PAL.**
==111==                       Ye shall.
==112==Is there record of any two that lov’d
==113==Better than we do, Arcite?

**ARC.**
==113==              Sure there cannot.

**PAL.**
==114==I do not think it possible our friendship
==115==Should ever leave us.

**ARC.**
==115==           Till our deaths it cannot,
*(Enter Emilia and her Woman below.)*
==116==And after death our spirits shall be led
==117==To those that love eternally. Speak on, sir.

**EMIL.**
==118==This garden has a world of pleasures in’t.
==119==What flow’r is this?

**WOMAN.**
==119==           ’Tis call’d narcissus, madam.

**EMIL.**
==120==That was a fair boy certain, but a fool
==121==To love himself. Were there not maids enough?

**ARC.**
==122==Pray forward.

**PAL.**
==122==        Yes.

**EMIL.**
==122==           Or were they all hard-hearted?

**WOMAN.**
==123==They could not be to one so fair.

**EMIL.**
==123==                  Thou wouldst not.

**WOMAN.**
==124==I think I should not, madam.

**EMIL.**
==124==                That’s a good wench!
==125==But take heed to your kindness though.

**WOMAN.**
==125==                     Why, madam?

**EMIL.**
==126==Men are mad things.

**ARC.**
==126==           Will ye go forward, cousin?

**EMIL.**
==127==Canst not thou work such flowers in silk, wench?

**WOMAN.**
==127==                         Yes.

**EMIL.**
==128==I’ll have a gown full of ’em, and of these:
==129==This is a pretty color, will’t not do
==130==Rarely upon a skirt, wench?

**WOMAN.**
==130==                Dainty, madam.

**ARC.**
==131==Cousin, cousin, how do you, sir? Why, Palamon!

**PAL.**
==132==Never till now I was in prison, Arcite.

**ARC.**
==133==Why, what’s the matter, man?

**PAL.**
==133==                Behold, and wonder!
==134==By heaven, she is a goddess.

**ARC.**
==134==                Ha!

**PAL.**
==134==                     Do reverence;
==135==She is a goddess, Arcite.

**EMIL.**
==135==              Of all flow’rs
==136==Methinks a rose is best.

**WOMAN.**
==136==              Why, gentle madam?

**EMIL.**
==137==It is the very emblem of a maid;
==138==For when the west wind courts her gently,
==139==How modestly she blows, and paints the sun
==140==With her chaste blushes! When the north comes near her,
==141==Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,
==142==She locks her beauties in her bud again,
==143==And leaves him to base briers.

**WOMAN.**
==143==                Yet, good madam,
==144==Sometimes her modesty will blow so far she falls for’t.
==145==A maid, if she have any honor, would be loath
==146==To take example by her.

**EMIL.**
==146==              Thou art wanton.

**ARC.**
==147==She is wondrous fair.

**PAL.**
==147==           She is all the beauty extant.

**EMIL.**
==148==The sun grows high, let’s walk in. Keep these flowers,
==149==We’ll see how near art can come near their colors.
==150==I am wondrous merry-hearted, I could laugh now.

**WOMAN.**
==151==I could lie down, I am sure.

**EMIL.**
==151==              And take one with you?

**WOMAN.**
==152==That’s as we bargain, madam.

**EMIL.**
==152==                Well, agree then.

*Exeunt Emilia and Woman.*

**PAL.**
==153==What think you of this beauty?

**ARC.**
==153==                  ’Tis a rare one.

**PAL.**
==154==Is’t but a rare one?

**ARC.**
==154==           Yes, a matchless beauty.

**PAL.**
==155==Might not a man well lose himself and love her?

**ARC.**
==156==I cannot tell what you have done; I have,
==157==Beshrew mine eyes for’t! Now I feel my shackles.

**PAL.**
==158==You love her then?

**ARC.**
==158==           Who would not?

**PAL.**
==158==                     And desire her?

**ARC.**
==159==Before my liberty.

**PAL.**
==160==I saw her first.

**ARC.**
==160==        That’s nothing.

**PAL.**
==160==                  But it shall be.

**ARC.**
==161==I saw her too.

**PAL.**
==161==        Yes, but you must not love her.

**ARC.**
==162==I will not, as you do—to worship her
==163==As she is heavenly and a blessed goddess;
==164==I love her as a woman, to enjoy her.
==165==So both may love.

**PAL.**
==165==           You shall not love at all.

**ARC.**
==166==Not love at all! Who shall deny me?

**PAL.**
==167==I, that first saw her; I, that took possession
==168==First with mine eye of all those beauties in her
==169==Reveal’d to mankind. If thou lov’st her,
==170==Or entertain’st a hope to blast my wishes,
==171==Thou art a traitor, Arcite, and a fellow
==172==False as thy title to her. Friendship, blood,
==173==And all the ties between us, I disclaim
==174==If thou once think upon her.

**ARC.**
==174==                Yes, I love her,
==175==And if the lives of all my name lay on it,
==176==I must do so; I love her with my soul;
==177==If that will lose ye, farewell, Palamon.
==178==I say again, I love, and in loving her maintain
==179==I am as worthy and as free a lover,
==180==And have as just a title to her beauty,
==181==As any Palamon or any living
==182==That is a man’s son.

**PAL.**
==182==           Have I call’d thee friend?

**ARC.**
==183==Yes, and have found me so. Why are you mov’d thus?
==184==Let me deal coldly with you: am not I
==185==Part of your blood, part of your soul? You have told me
==186==That I was Palamon, and you were Arcite.

**PAL.**
==186==                         Yes.

**ARC.**
==187==Am not I liable to those affections,
==188==Those joys, griefs, angers, fears, my friend shall suffer?

**PAL.**
==189==Ye may be.

**ARC.**
==189==    Why then would you deal so cunningly,
==190==So strangely, so unlike a noble kinsman,
==191==To love alone? Speak truly: do you think me
==192==Unworthy of her sight?

**PAL.**
==192==              No; but unjust
==193==If thou pursue that sight.

**ARC.**
==193==              Because another
==194==First sees the enemy, shall I stand still,
==195==And let mine honor down, and never charge?

**PAL.**
==196==Yes, if he be but one.

**ARC.**
==196==              But say that one
==197==Had rather combat me?

**PAL.**
==197==              Let that one say so,
==198==And use thy freedom; else, if thou pursuest her,
==199==Be as that cursed man that hates his country,
==200==A branded villain.

**ARC.**
==200==           You are mad.

**PAL.**
==200==                     I must be⁠—
==201==Till thou art worthy, Arcite, it concerns me,
==202==And in this madness if I hazard thee
==203==And take thy life, I deal but truly.

**ARC.**
==203==                  Fie, sir!
==204==You play the child extremely. I will love her,
==205==I must, I ought to do so, and I dare⁠—
==206==And all this justly.

**PAL.**
==206==           O that now, that now
==207==Thy false-self and thy friend had but this fortune
==208==To be one hour at liberty, and grasp
==209==Our good swords in our hands, I would quickly teach thee
==210==What ’twere to filch affection from another!
==211==Thou art baser in it than a cutpurse.
==212==Put but thy head out of this window more,
==213==And as I have a soul, I’ll nail thy life to’t!

**ARC.**
==214==Thou dar’st not, fool, thou canst not, thou art feeble.
==215==Put my head out? I’ll throw my body out,
==216==And leap the garden, when I see her next,
==217==And pitch between her arms to anger thee.

*Enter Jailer above.*

**PAL.**
==218==No more; the keeper’s coming. I shall live
==219==To knock thy brains out with my shackles.

**ARC.**
==219==                       Do.

**JAIL.**
==220==By your leave, gentlemen.

**PAL.**
==220==              Now, honest keeper?

**JAIL.**
==221==Lord Arcite, you must presently to th’ Duke;
==222==The cause I know not yet.

**ARC.**
==222==              I am ready, keeper.

**JAIL.**
==223==Prince Palamon, I must awhile bereave you
==224==Of your fair cousin’s company.

*Exeunt Arcite and Jailer.*

**PAL.**
==224==                  And me too,
==225==Even when you please, of life. Why is he sent for?
==226==It may be he shall marry her; he’s goodly,
==227==And like enough the Duke hath taken notice
==228==Both of his blood and body. But his falsehood!
==229==Why should a friend be treacherous? If that
==230==Get him a wife so noble and so fair,
==231==Let honest men ne’er love again. Once more
==232==I would but see this fair one. Blessed garden,
==233==And fruit and flowers more blessed, that still blossom
==234==As her bright eyes shine on ye, would I were,
==235==For all the fortune of my life hereafter,
==236==Yon little tree, yon blooming apricot!
==237==How I would spread, and fling my wanton arms
==238==In at her window! I would bring her fruit
==239==Fit for the gods to feed on; youth and pleasure,
==240==Still as she tasted, should be doubled on her,
==241==And if she be not heavenly, I would make her
==242==So near the gods in nature, they should fear her;
==243==And then I am sure she would love me.
*(Enter Jailer above.)*
==243==                     How now, keeper,
==244==Where’s Arcite?

**JAIL.**
==244==        Banish’d. Prince Pirithous
==245==Obtained his liberty; but never more,
==246==Upon his oath and life, must he set foot
==247==Upon this kingdom.

**PAL.**
*(Aside.)*
==247==           He’s a blessed man!
==248==He shall see Thebes again, and call to arms
==249==The bold young men that when he bids ’em charge,
==250==Fall on like fire. Arcite shall have a fortune,
==251==If he dare make himself a worthy lover,
==252==Yet in the field to strike a battle for her;
==253==And if he lose her then, he’s a cold coward.
==254==How bravely may he bear himself to win her,
==255==If he be noble Arcite—thousand ways!
==256==Were I at liberty, I would do things
==257==Of such a virtuous greatness that this lady,
==258==This blushing virgin, should take manhood to her
==259==And seek to ravish me.

**JAIL.**
==259==              My lord, for you
==260==I have this charge too⁠—

**PAL.**
==260==           To discharge my life?

**JAIL.**
==261==No, but from this place to remove your lordship;
==262==The windows are too open.

**PAL.**
==262==              Devils take ’em
==263==That are so envious to me! Prithee kill me.

**JAIL.**
==264==And hang for’t afterward!

**PAL.**
==264==              By this good light,
==265==Had I a sword, I would kill thee.

**JAIL.**
==265==                  Why, my lord?

**PAL.**
==266==Thou bring’st such pelting scurvy news continually,
==267==Thou art not worthy life. I will not go.

**JAIL.**
==268==Indeed you must, my lord.

**PAL.**
==268==              May I see the garden?

**JAIL.**
==269==No.

**PAL.**
==269==    Then I am resolv’d, I will not go.

**JAIL.**
==269==                     I must
==270==Constrain you then; and for you are dangerous
==271==I’ll clap more irons on you.

**PAL.**
==271==              Do, good keeper.
==272==I’ll shake ’em so, ye shall not sleep,
==273==I’ll make ye a new Morris. Must I go?

**JAIL.**
==274==There is no remedy.

**PAL.**
*(Aside.)*
==274==           Farewell, kind window.
==275==May rude wind never hurt thee! O my lady,
==276==If ever thou hast felt what sorrow was,
==277==Dream how I suffer!—Come; now bury me.

*Exeunt Palamon and Jailer.*
