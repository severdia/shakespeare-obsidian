## Act 1, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Prologue|← Act 1, Prologue]] | [[Act 1, Scene 2|Act 1, Scene 2 →]]

*Athens. Before a temple.*

*Enter Hymen with a torch burning; a Boy, in a white robe, before, singing and strewing flow’rs; after Hymen, a Nymph, encompass’d in her tresses, bearing a wheaten garland; then Theseus, between two other Nymphs with wheaten chaplets an their heads; then Hippolyta, the bride, led by Pirithous, and another holding a garland over her head (her tresses likewise hanging; after her, Emilia, holding up her train; Artesius and Attendants.*

**BOY.**
*(Music. The Song by the Boy.)*
==1==*Roses, their sharp spines being gone,*
==2==*Not royal in their smells alone,*
==3==*But in their hue;*
==4==*Maiden pinks, of odor faint,*
==5==*Daisies smell-less, yet most quaint,*
==6==*And sweet thyme true;*
==7==*Primrose, first-born child of Ver,*
==8==*Merry spring-time’s harbinger,*
==9==*With her bells dim;*
==10==*Oxlips in their cradles growing,*
==11==*Marigolds on death-beds blowing,*
==12==*Larks’-heels trim;*
==13==*All dear Nature’s children sweet,*
==14==*Lie ’fore bride and bridegroom’s feet.*
*(Strew flowers.)*
==15==*Blessing their sense;*
==16==*Not an angel of the air,*
==17==*Bird melodious, or bird fair,*
==18==*Is absent hence.*
==19==*The crow, the sland’rous cuckoo, nor*
==20==*The boding raven, nor chough hoar,*
==21==*Nor chatt’ring pie,*
==22==*May on our bridehouse perch or sing,*
==23==*Or with them any discord bring,*
==24==*But from it fly.*

*Enter three Queens, in black, with veils stain’d, with imperial crowns.*

*The first Queen falls down at the foot of Theseus; the second falls down at the foot of Hippolyta; the third before Emilia.*

**1. QUEEN.**
==25==For pity’s sake and true gentility’s,
==26==Hear and respect me.

**2. QUEEN.**
==26==           For your mother’s sake,
==27==And as you wish your womb may thrive with fair ones,
==28==Hear and respect me.

**3. QUEEN.**
==29==Now for the love of him whom Jove hath mark’d
==30==The honor of your bed, and for the sake
==31==Of clear virginity, be advocate
==32==For us and our distresses! This good deed
==33==Shall raze you out o’ th’ book of trespasses
==34==All you are set down there.

**THE.**
==35==Sad lady, rise.

**HIP.**
==35==        Stand up.

**EMIL.**
==35==              No knees to me.
==36==What woman I may stead that is distress’d
==37==Does bind me to her.

**THE.**
==38==What’s your request? Deliver you for all.

**1. QUEEN.**
==39==We are three queens, whose sovereigns fell before
==40==The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured
==41==The beaks of ravens, talents of the kites,
==42==And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.
==43==He will not suffer us to bum their bones,
==44==To urn their ashes, nor to take th’ offense
==45==Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye
==46==Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds
==47==With stench of our slain lords. O, pity, Duke,
==48==Thou purger of the earth, draw thy fear’d sword
==49==That does good turns to th’ world; give us the bones
==50==Of our dead kings, that we may chapel them;
==51==And of thy boundless goodness take some note
==52==That for our crowned heads we have no roof,
==53==Save this which is the lion’s, and the bear’s,
==54==And vault to every thing!

**THE.**
==54==              Pray you kneel not;
==55==I was transported with your speech, and suffer’d
==56==Your knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the fortunes
==57==Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting
==58==As wakes my vengeance and revenge for ’em.
==59==King Capaneus was your lord. The day
==60==That he should marry you, at such a season
==61==As now it is with me, I met your groom
==62==By Mars’s altar. You were that time fair;
==63==Not Juno’s mantle fairer than your tresses,
==64==Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreath
==65==Was then nor thresh’d nor blasted; Fortune at you
==66==Dimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules our kinsman
==67==(Then weaker than your eyes) laid by his club;
==68==He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide,
==69==And swore his sinews thaw’d. O grief and time,
==70==Fearful consumers, you will all devour!

**1. QUEEN.**
==71==O, I hope some god,
==72==Some god hath put his mercy in your manhood,
==73==Whereto he’ll infuse pow’r, and press you forth
==74==Our undertaker.

**THE.**
==74==        O, no knees, none, widow!
==75==Unto the helmeted Bellona use them,
==76==And pray for me your soldier.
==77==Troubled I am.

*Turns away.*

**2. QUEEN.**
==77==           Honored Hippolyta,
==78==Most dreaded Amazonian, that hast slain
==79==The scythe-tusk’d boar; that with thy arm, as strong
==80==As it is white, wast near to make the male
==81==To thy sex captive, but that this thy lord,
==82==Born to uphold creation in that honor
==83==First Nature styl’d it in, shrunk thee into
==84==The bound thou wast o’erflowing, at once subduing
==85==Thy force and thy affection; soldieress
==86==That equally canst poise sternness with pity,
==87==Whom now I know hast much more power on him
==88==Than ever he had on thee, who ow’st his strength,
==89==And his love too, who is a servant for
==90==The tenor of thy speech; dear glass of ladies,
==91==Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,
==92==Under the shadow of his sword may cool us;
==93==Require him he advance it o’er our heads;
==94==Speak’t in a woman’s key—like such a woman
==95==As any of us three; weep ere you fail;
==96==Lend us a knee;
==97==But touch the ground for us no longer time
==98==Than a dove’s motion when the head’s pluck’d off;
==99==Tell him, if he i’ th’ blood-siz’d field lay swoll’n,
==100==Showing the sun his teeth, grinning at the moon,
==101==What you would do.

**HIP.**
==101==           Poor lady, say no more:
==102==I had as lief trace this good action with you
==103==As that whereto I am going, and never yet
==104==Went I so willing way. My lord is taken
==105==Heart-deep with your distress. Let him consider.
==106==I’ll speak anon.

**3. QUEEN.**
==106==        O, my petition was
*(Kneel to Emilia.)*
==107==Set down in ice, which by hot grief uncandied
==108==Melts into drops; so sorrow wanting form
==109==Is press’d with deeper matter.

**EMIL.**
==109==                Pray stand up,
==110==Your grief is written in your cheek.

**3. QUEEN.**
==110==                  O, woe,
==111==You cannot read it there. There, through my tears,
==112==Like wrinkled pebbles in a glassy stream,
==113==You may behold ’em. Lady, lady, alack!
==114==He that will all the treasure know o’ th’ earth
==115==Must know the center too; he that will fish
==116==For my least minnow, let him lead his line
==117==To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me,
==118==Extremity, that sharpens sundry wits,
==119==Makes me a fool.

**EMIL.**
==119==           Pray you say nothing, pray you.
==120==Who cannot feel nor see the rain, being in’t,
==121==Knows neither wet nor dry. If that you were
==122==The ground-piece of some painter, I would buy you
==123==T’ instruct me ’gainst a capital grief indeed⁠—
==124==Such heart-pierc’d demonstration! But alas,
==125==Being a natural sister of our sex,
==126==Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me
==127==That it shall make a counter-reflect ’gainst
==128==My brother’s heart, and warm it to some pity,
==129==Though it were made of stone. Pray have good comfort.

**THE.**
==130==Forward to th’ temple. Leave not out a jot
==131==O’ th’ sacred ceremony.

**1. QUEEN.**
==131==              O, this celebration
==132==Will long last and be more costly than
==133==Your suppliants’ war! Remember that your fame
==134==Knolls in the ear o’ th’ world; what you do quickly
==135==Is not done rashly; your first thought is more
==136==Than others’ labored meditance; your premeditating
==137==More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,
==138==Soon as they move, as asprays do the fish,
==139==Subdue before they touch. Think, dear Duke, think
==140==What beds our slain kings have!

**2. QUEEN.**
==140==                  What griefs our beds
==141==That our dear lords have none!

**3. QUEEN.**
==141==                  None fit for th’ dead:
==142==Those that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,
==143==Weary of this world’s light, have to themselves
==144==Been death’s most horrid agents, humane grace
==145==Affords them dust and shadow.

**1. QUEEN.**
==145==                  But our lords
==146==Lie blist’ring ’fore the visitating sun,
==147==And were good kings when living.

**THE.**
==148==It is true; and I will give you comfort
==149==To give your dead lords graves; the which to do
==150==Must make some work with Creon.

**1. QUEEN.**
==151==And that work presents itself to th’ doing:
==152==Now ’twill take form, the heats are gone tomorrow.
==153==Then, bootless toil must recompense itself
==154==With its own sweat; now he’s secure,
==155==Not dreams we stand before your puissance
==156==Wrinching our holy begging in our eyes
==157==To make petition clear.

**2. QUEEN.**
==157==              Now you may take him
==158==Drunk with his victory.

**3. QUEEN.**
==158==              And his army full
==159==Of bread and sloth.

**THE.**
==159==           Artesius, that best knowest
==160==How to draw out, fit to this enterprise,
==161==The prim’st for this proceeding, and the number
==162==To carry such a business, forth and levy
==163==Our worthiest instruments, whilst we dispatch
==164==This grand act of our life, this daring deed
==165==Of fate in wedlock.

**1. QUEEN.**
==165==           Dowagers, take hands,
==166==Let us be widows to our woes; delay
==167==Commends us to a famishing hope.

**ALL QUEENS.**
==167==                  Farewell.

**2. QUEEN.**
==168==We come unseasonably; but when could grief
==169==Cull forth, as unpang’d judgment can, fitt’st time
==170==For best solicitation?

**THE.**
==170==           Why, good ladies,
==171==This is a service, whereto I am going,
==172==Greater than any war; it more imports me
==173==Than all the actions that I have foregone,
==174==Or futurely can cope.

**1. QUEEN.**
==174==           The more proclaiming
==175==Our suit shall be neglected. When her arms,
==176==Able to lock Jove from a synod, shall
==177==By warranting moonlight corslet thee—O, when
==178==Her twinning cherries shall their sweetness fall
==179==Upon thy tasteful lips, what wilt thou think
==180==Of rotten kings or blubber’d queens? What care
==181==For what thou feel’st not? What thou feel’st being able
==182==To make Mars spurn his drum. O, if thou couch
==183==But one night with her, every hour in’t will
==184==Take hostage of thee for a hundred, and
==185==Thou shalt remember nothing more than what
==186==That banquet bids thee to!

**HIP.**
==186==              Though much unlike
==187==You should be so transported, as much sorry
==188==I should be such a suitor; yet I think
==189==Did I not by th’ abstaining of my joy,
==190==Which breeds a deeper longing, cure their surfeit
==191==That craves a present med’cine, I should pluck
==192==All ladies’ scandal on me. Therefore, sir,
*(Kneels.)*
==193==As I shall here make trial of my pray’rs,
==194==Either presuming them to have some force,
==195==Or sentencing for aye their vigor dumb,
==196==Prorogue this business we are going about, and hang
==197==Your shield afore your heart, about that neck
==198==Which is my fee, and which I freely lend
==199==To do these poor queens service.

**ALL QUEENS.**
*(To Emilia.)*
==199==                  O, help now!
==200==Our cause cries for your knee.

**EMIL.**
*(Kneels.)*
==200==                If you grant not
==201==My sister her petition, in that force,
==202==With that celerity and nature, which
==203==She makes it in, from henceforth I’ll not dare
==204==To ask you any thing, nor be so hardy
==205==Ever to take a husband.

**THE.**
==205==              Pray stand up.
*(They rise.)*
==206==I am entreating of myself to do
==207==That which you kneel to have me. Pirithous,
==208==Lead on the bride; get you and pray the gods
==209==For success and return; omit not any thing
==210==In the pretended celebration. Queens,
==211==Follow your soldier.
*(To Artesius.)*
==211==              As before, hence you,
==212==And at the banks of Aulis meet us with
==213==The forces you can raise, where we shall find
==214==The moi’ty of a number for a business
==215==More bigger-look’d.
*(Exit Artesius.)*
*(To Hippolyta.)*
==215==           Since that our theme is haste,
==216==I stamp this kiss upon thy currant lip.
==217==Sweet, keep it as my token. Set you forward,
==218==For I will see you gone.
*(Exeunt slowly towards the temple.)*
==219==Farewell, my beauteous sister. Pirithous,
==220==Keep the feast full, bate not an hour on’t.

**PIR.**
==220==                     Sir,
==221==I’ll follow you at heels; the feast’s solemnity
==222==Shall want till your return.

**THE.**
==222==              Cousin, I charge you
==223==Budge not from Athens. We shall be returning
==224==Ere you can end this feast, of which I pray you
==225==Make no abatement. Once more, farewell all.

**1. QUEEN.**
==226==Thus dost thou still make good
==227==The tongue o’ th’ world.

**2. QUEEN.**
==227==              And earn’st a deity
==228==Equal with Mars.

**3. QUEEN.**
==228==           If not above him, for
==229==Thou being but mortal makest affections bend
==230==To godlike honors; they themselves, some say,
==231==Groan under such a mast’ry.

**THE.**
==231==                As we are men
==232==Thus should we do, being sensually subdu’d
==233==We lose our human title. Good cheer, ladies.
==234==Now turn we towards your comforts.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
