**EPILOGUE**
==1==I would now ask ye how ye like the play,
==2==But as it is with schoolboys, cannot say;
==3==I am cruel fearful. Pray yet stay a while,
==4==And let me look upon ye. No man smile?
==5==Then it goes hard, I see. He that has
==6==Lov’d a young handsome wench then, show his face⁠—
==7==’Tis strange if none be here—and if he will
==8==Against his conscience, let him hiss, and kill
==9==Our market. ’Tis in vain, I see, to stay ye;
==10==Have at the worst can come, then! Now what say ye?
==11==And yet mistake me not: I am not bold,
==12==We have no such cause. If the tale we have told
==13==(For ’tis no other) any way content ye
==14==(For to that honest purpose it was meant ye),
==15==We have our end; and ye shall have ere long
==16==I dare say many a better, to prolong
==17==Your old loves to us. We, and all our might,
==18==Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.


*Flourish.*
