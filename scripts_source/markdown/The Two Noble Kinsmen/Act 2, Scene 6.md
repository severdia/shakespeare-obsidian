## Act 2, Scene 6
[[Act 2, Scene 5|← Act 2, Scene 5]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*Athens. Before the prison.*

*Enter Jailer’s Daughter alone.*

**DAUGH.**
==1== Let all the dukes and all the devils roar,
==2== He is at liberty! I have ventur’d for him,
==3== And out I have brought him to a little wood
==4== A mile hence. I have sent him where a cedar,
==5== Higher than all the rest, spreads like a plane
==6== Fast by a brook, and there he shall keep close
==7== Till I provide him files and food, for yet
==8== His iron bracelets are not off. O Love,
==9== What a stout-hearted child thou art! My father
==10== Durst better have endur’d cold iron than done it.
==11== I love him beyond love and beyond reason,
==12== Or wit, or safety. I have made him know it.
==13== I care not, I am desperate. If the law
==14== Find me, and then condemn me for’t, some wenches,
==15== Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge,
==16== And tell to memory my death was noble,
==17== Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes
==18== I purpose is my way too. Sure he cannot
==19== Be so unmanly as to leave me here.
==20== If he do, maids will not so easily
==21== Trust men again. And yet he has not thank’d me
==22== For what I have done; no, not so much as kiss’d me;
==23== And that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcely
==24== Could I persuade him to become a freeman,
==25== He made such scruples of the wrong he did
==26== To me and to my father. Yet I hope,
==27== When he considers more, this love of mine
==28== Will take more root within him. Let him do
==29== What he will with me, so he use me kindly,
==30== For use me so he shall, or I’ll proclaim him,
==31== And to his face, no man. I’ll presently
==32== Provide him necessaries, and pack my clothes up,
==33== And where there is a path of ground I’ll venture,
==34== So he be with me. By him, like a shadow,
==35== I’ll ever dwell. Within this hour the whoobub
==36== Will be all o’er the prison. I am then
==37== Kissing the man they look for. Farewell, father;
==38== Get many more such prisoners and such daughters,
==39== And shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him!

*Exit.*
