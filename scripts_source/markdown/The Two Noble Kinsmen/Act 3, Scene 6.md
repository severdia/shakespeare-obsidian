## Act 3, Scene 6
[[Act 3, Scene 5|← Act 3, Scene 5]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of the forest near Athens.*

*Enter Palamon from the bush.*

**PAL.**
==1== About this hour my cousin gave his faith
==2== To visit me again, and with him bring
==3== Two swords and two good armors. If he fail,
==4== He’s neither man nor soldier. When he left me,
==5== I did not think a week could have restor’d
==6== My lost strength to me, I was grown so low
==7== And crestfall’n with my wants. I thank thee, Arcite,
==8== Thou art yet a fair foe; and I feel myself,
==9== With this refreshing, able once again
==10== To out-dure danger. To delay it longer
==11== Would make the world think, when it comes to hearing,
==12== That I lay fatting like a swine, to fight,
==13== And not a soldier: therefore this blest morning
==14== Shall be the last; and that sword he refuses,
==15== If it but hold, I kill him with. ’Tis justice.
==16== So, love and fortune for me!
*(Enter Arcite with armors and swords.)*
==16==                 O, good morrow.

**ARC.**
==17== Good morrow, noble kinsman.

**PAL.**
==17==                 I have put you
==18== To too much pains, sir.

**ARC.**
==18==               That too much, fair cousin,
==19== Is but a debt to honor, and my duty.

**PAL.**
==20== Would you were so in all, sir! I could wish ye
==21== As kind a kinsman as you force me find
==22== A beneficial foe, that my embraces
==23== Might thank ye, not my blows.

**ARC.**
==23==                   I shall think either,
==24== Well done, a noble recompense.

**PAL.**
==24==                 Then I shall quit you.

**ARC.**
==25== Defy me in these fair terms, and you show
==26== More than a mistress to me; no more anger,
==27== As you love any thing that’s honorable.
==28== We were not bred to talk, man. When we are arm’d
==29== And both upon our guards, then let our fury,
==30== Like meeting of two tides, fly strongly from us,
==31== And then to whom the birthright of this beauty
==32== Truly pertains (without obbraidings, scorns,
==33== Despisings of our persons, and such poutings,
==34== Fitter for girls and schoolboys) will be seen,
==35== And quickly, yours or mine. Will’t please you arm, sir?
==36== Or if you feel yourself not fitting yet
==37== And furnish’d with your old strength, I’ll stay, cousin,
==38== And ev’ry day discourse you into health,
==39== As I am spar’d. Your person I am friends with,
==40== And I could wish I had not said I lov’d her,
==41== Though I had died; but loving such a lady
==42== And justifying my love, I must not fly from’t.

**PAL.**
==43== Arcite, thou art so brave an enemy
==44== That no man but thy cousin’s fit to kill thee.
==45== I am well and lusty, choose your arms.

**ARC.**
==45==                      Choose you, sir.

**PAL.**
==46== Wilt thou exceed in all, or dost thou do it
==47== To make me spare thee?

**ARC.**
==47==               If you think so, cousin,
==48== You are deceived, for as I am a soldier,
==49== I will not spare you.

**PAL.**
==49==            That’s well said.

**ARC.**
==49==                      You’ll find it.

**PAL.**
==50== Then as I am an honest man, and love
==51== With all the justice of affection,
==52== I’ll pay thee soundly. This I’ll take.

**ARC.**
==52==                   That’s mine then.
==53== I’ll arm you first.

**PAL.**
==53==            Do. Pray thee tell me, cousin,
==54== Where got’st thou this good armor?

**ARC.**
==54==                   ’Tis the Duke’s,
==55== And to say true, I stole it. Do I pinch you?

**PAL.**
==55==                          No.

**ARC.**
==56== Is’t not too heavy?

**PAL.**
==56==            I have worn a lighter,
==57== But I shall make it serve.

**ARC.**
==57==               I’ll buckle’t close.

**PAL.**
==58== By any means.

**ARC.**
==58==         You care not for a grand-guard?

**PAL.**
==59== No, no, we’ll use no horses. I perceive
==60== You would fain be at that fight.

**ARC.**
==60==                   I am indifferent.

**PAL.**
==61== Faith, so am I. Good cousin, thrust the buckle
==62== Through far enough.

**ARC.**
==62==            I warrant you.

**PAL.**
==62==                   My casque now.

**ARC.**
==63== Will you fight bare-arm’d?

**PAL.**
==63==               We shall be the nimbler.

**ARC.**
==64== But use your gauntlets though. Those are o’ th’ least;
==65== Prithee take mine, good cousin.

**PAL.**
==65==                   Thank you, Arcite.
==66== How do I look? Am I fall’n much away?

**ARC.**
==67== Faith, very little. Love has us’d you kindly.

**PAL.**
==68== I’ll warrant thee, I’ll strike home.

**ARC.**
==68==                   Do, and spare not.
==69== I’ll give you cause, sweet cousin.

**PAL.**
==69==                   Now to you, sir.
==70== Methinks this armor’s very like that, Arcite,
==71== Thou wor’st that day the three kings fell, but lighter.

**ARC.**
==72== That was a very good one, and that day,
==73== I well remember, you outdid me, cousin;
==74== I never saw such valor. When you charg’d
==75== Upon the left wing of the enemy,
==76== I spurr’d hard to come up, and under me
==77== I had a right good horse.

**PAL.**
==77==               You had indeed,
==78== A bright bay, I remember.

**ARC.**
==78==               Yes, but all
==79== Was vainly labor’d in me; you outwent me,
==80== Nor could my wishes reach you. Yet a little
==81== I did by imitation.

**PAL.**
==81==            More by virtue.
==82== You are modest, cousin.

**ARC.**
==82==               When I saw you charge first,
==83== Methought I heard a dreadful clap of thunder
==84== Break from the troop.

**PAL.**
==84==            But still before that flew
==85== The lightning of your valor. Stay a little;
==86== Is not this piece too strait?

**ARC.**
==86==               No, no, ’tis well.

**PAL.**
==87== I would have nothing hurt thee but my sword,
==88== A bruise would be dishonor.

**ARC.**
==88==                 Now I am perfect.

**PAL.**
==89== Stand off then.

**ARC.**
==89==         Take my sword, I hold it better.

**PAL.**
==90== I thank ye. No, keep it, your life lies on it.
==91== Here’s one, if it but hold, I ask no more
==92== For all my hopes. My cause and honor guard me!

**ARC.**
==93== And me my love!
*(They bow several ways; then advance and stand.)*
==93==            Is there aught else to say?

**PAL.**
==94== This only, and no more: thou art mine aunt’s son,
==95== And that blood we desire to shed is mutual,
==96== In me, thine, and in thee, mine. My sword
==97== Is in my hand, and if thou kill’st me,
==98== The gods and I forgive thee. If there be
==99== A place prepar’d for those that sleep in honor,
==100== I wish his weary soul that falls may win it.
==101== Fight bravely, cousin. Give me thy noble hand.

**ARC.**
==102== Here, Palamon: this hand shall never more
==103== Come near thee with such friendship.

**PAL.**
==103==                      I commend thee.

**ARC.**
==104== If I fall, curse me, and say I was a coward,
==105== For none but such dare die in these just trials.
==106== Once more farewell, my cousin.

**PAL.**
==106==                   Farewell, Arcite.

*Fight. Horns within; they stand.*

**ARC.**
==107== Lo, cousin, lo, our folly has undone us.

**PAL.**
==108== Why?

**ARC.**
==108==     This is the Duke, a-hunting as I told you.
==109== If we be found, we are wretched. O, retire
==110== For honor’s sake, and safely presently
==111== Into your bush again, sir. We shall find
==112== Too many hours to die in, gentle cousin.
==113== If you be seen, you perish instantly
==114== For breaking prison, and I, if you reveal me,
==115== For my contempt. Then all the world will scorn us,
==116== And say we had a noble difference,
==117== But base disposers of it.

**PAL.**
==117==               No, no, cousin,
==118== I will no more be hidden, nor put off
==119== This great adventure to a second trial.
==120== I know your cunning, and I know your cause.
==121== He that faints now, shame take him! Put thyself
==122== Upon thy present guard⁠—

**ARC.**
==122==               You are not mad?

**PAL.**
==123== Or I will make th’ advantage of this hour
==124== Mine own; and what to come shall threaten me
==125== I fear less than my fortune. Know, weak cousin,
==126== I love Emilia, and in that I’ll bury
==127== Thee and all crosses else.

**ARC.**
==127==               Then come what can come,
==128== Thou shalt know, Palamon, I dare as well
==129== Die as discourse or sleep. Only this fears me,
==130== The law will have the honor of our ends.
==131== Have at thy life!

**PAL.**
==131==         Look to thine own well, Arcite.

*Fight again. Horns.*

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Pirithous, and Train.*

**THE.**
==132== What ignorant and mad malicious traitors
==133== Are you, that ’gainst the tenor of my laws
==134== Are making battle, thus like knights appointed,
==135== Without my leave and officers of arms?
==136== By Castor, both shall die.

**PAL.**
==136==               Hold thy word, Theseus.
==137== We are certainly both traitors, both despisers
==138== Of thee and of thy goodness. I am Palamon,
==139== That cannot love thee, he that broke thy prison⁠—
==140== Think well what that deserves; and this is Arcite,
==141== A bolder traitor never trod thy ground,
==142== A falser nev’r seem’d friend. This is the man
==143== Was begg’d and banish’d, this is he contemns thee
==144== And what thou dar’st do; and in this disguise,
==145== Against thy own edict, follows thy sister,
==146== That fortunate bright star, the fair Emilia,
==147== Whose servant (if there be a right in seeing,
==148== And first bequeathing of the soul to) justly
==149== I am, and which is more, dares think her his.
==150== This treachery, like a most trusty lover,
==151== I call’d him now to answer. If thou be’st,
==152== As thou art spoken, great and virtuous,
==153== The true decider of all injuries,
==154== Say, “Fight again!” and thou shalt see me, Theseus,
==155== Do such a justice thou thyself wilt envy.
==156== Then take my life, I’ll woo thee to’t.

**PIR.**
==156==                   O heaven,
==157== What more than man is this!

**THE.**
==157==                 I have sworn.

**ARC.**
==157==                        We seek not
==158== Thy breath of mercy, Theseus. ’Tis to me
==159== A thing as soon to die as thee to say it,
==160== And no more mov’d. Where this man calls me traitor,
==161== Let me say thus much: if in love be treason
==162== In service of so excellent a beauty,
==163== As I love most, and in that faith will perish,
==164== As I have brought my life here to confirm it,
==165== As I have serv’d her truest, worthiest,
==166== As I dare kill this cousin that denies it,
==167== So let me be most traitor, and ye please me.
==168== For scorning thy edict, Duke, ask that lady
==169== Why she is fair, and why her eyes command me
==170== Stay here to love her; and if she say “traitor,”
==171== I am a villain fit to lie unburied.

**PAL.**
==172== Thou shalt have pity of us both, O Theseus,
==173== If unto neither thou show mercy. Stop,
==174== As thou art just, thy noble ear against us;
==175== As thou art valiant, for thy cousin’s soul,
==176== Whose twelve strong labors crown his memory,
==177== Let ’s die together, at one instant, Duke.
==178== Only a little let him fall before me,
==179== That I may tell my soul he shall not have her.

**THE.**
==180== I grant your wish, for to say true, your cousin
==181== Has ten times more offended, for I gave him
==182== More mercy than you found, sir, your offenses
==183== Being no more than his. None here speak for ’em,
==184== For ere the sun set, both shall sleep forever.

**HIP.**
==185== Alas, the pity! Now or never, sister,
==186== Speak, not to be denied. That face of yours
==187== Will bear the curses else of after-ages
==188== For these lost cousins.

**EMIL.**
==188==               In my face, dear sister,
==189== I find no anger to ’em, nor no ruin:
==190== The misadventure of their own eyes kill ’em;
==191== Yet that I will be woman, and have pity,
==192== My knees shall grow to th’ ground but I’ll get mercy.
==193== Help me, dear sister, in a deed so virtuous
==194== The powers of all women will be with us.
==195== Most royal brother⁠—

*They kneel.*

**HIP.**
==195==            Sir, by our tie of marriage⁠—

**EMIL.**
==196== By your own spotless honor⁠—

**HIP.**
==196==                 By that faith,
==197== That fair hand, and that honest heart you gave me⁠—

**EMIL.**
==198== By that you would have pity in another,
==199== By your own virtues infinite⁠—

**HIP.**
==199==                   By valor,
==200== By all the chaste nights I have ever pleas’d you⁠—

**THE.**
==201== These are strange conjurings.

**PIR.**
==201==                 Nay then I’ll in too.
*(Kneels.)*
==202== By all our friendship, sir, by all our dangers,
==203== By all you love most—wars, and this sweet lady⁠—

**EMIL.**
==204== By that you would have trembled to deny
==205== A blushing maid⁠—

**HIP.**
==205==            By your own eyes, by strength,
==206== In which you swore I went beyond all women,
==207== Almost all men, and yet I yielded, Theseus⁠—

**PIR.**
==208== To crown all this, by your most noble soul,
==209== Which cannot want due mercy, I beg first.

**HIP.**
==210== Next hear my prayers.

**EMIL.**
==210==            Last let me entreat, sir.

**PIR.**
==211== For mercy.

**HIP.**
==211==         Mercy.

**EMIL.**
==211==               Mercy on these princes.

**THE.**
==212== Ye make my faith reel. Say I felt
==213== Compassion to ’em both, how would you place it?

**EMIL.**
==214== Upon their lives; but with their banishments.

**THE.**
==215== You are a right woman, sister, you have pity,
==216== But want the understanding where to use it.
==217== If you desire their lives, invent a way
==218== Safer than banishment. Can these two live,
==219== And have the agony of love about ’em,
==220== And not kill one another? Every day
==221== They’ld fight about you; hourly bring your honor
==222== In public question with their swords. Be wise then
==223== And here forget ’em; it concerns your credit
==224== And my oath equally. I have said they die;
==225== Better they fall by th’ law than one another.
==226== Bow not my honor.

**EMIL.**
==226==            O my noble brother,
==227== That oath was rashly made, and in your anger,
==228== Your reason will not hold it. If such vows
==229== Stand for express will, all the world must perish.
==230== Beside, I have another oath ’gainst yours,
==231== Of more authority, I am sure more love,
==232== Not made in passion neither, but good heed.

**THE.**
==233== What is it, sister?

**PIR.**
==233==            Urge it home, brave lady.

**EMIL.**
==234== That you would nev’r deny me any thing
==235== Fit for my modest suit and your free granting.
==236== I tie you to your word now; if ye fall in’t,
==237== Think how you maim your honor
==238== (For now I am set a-begging, sir, I am deaf
==239== To all but your compassion), how their lives
==240== Might breed the ruin of my name; opinion,
==241== Shall any thing that loves me perish for me?
==242== That were a cruel wisdom. Do men proin
==243== The straight young boughs that blush with thousand blossoms,
==244== Because they may be rotten? O Duke Theseus,
==245== The goodly mothers that have groan’d for these,
==246== And all the longing maids that ever lov’d,
==247== If your vow stand, shall curse me and my beauty,
==248== And in their funeral songs for these two cousins
==249== Despise my cruelty, and cry woe worth me,
==250== Till I am nothing but the scorn of women.
==251== For heaven’s sake save their lives, and banish ’em.

**THE.**
==252== On what conditions?

**EMIL.**
==252==            Swear ’em never more
==253== To make me their contention, or to know me,
==254== To tread upon thy dukedom, and to be,
==255== Where ever they shall travel, ever strangers
==256== To one another.

**PAL.**
==256==            I’ll be cut a-pieces
==257== Before I take this oath. Forget I love her?
==258== O all ye gods, despise me then. Thy banishment
==259== I not mislike, so we may fairly carry
==260== Our swords and cause along; else, never trifle,
==261== But take our lives, Duke. I must love, and will,
==262== And for that love must and dare kill this cousin,
==263== On any piece the earth has.

**THE.**
==263==               Will you, Arcite,
==264== Take these conditions?

**PAL.**
==264==               He’s a villain then.

**PIR.**
==265== These are men!

**ARC.**
==266== No, never. Duke. ’Tis worse to me than begging
==267== To take my life so basely. Though I think
==268== I never shall enjoy her, yet I’ll preserve
==269== The honor of affection, and die for her,
==270== Make death a devil.

**THE.**
==271== What may be done? For now I feel compassion.

**PIR.**
==272== Let it not fall again, sir.

**THE.**
==272==               Say, Emilia,
==273== If one of them were dead, as one must, are you
==274== Content to take th’ other to your husband?
==275== They cannot both enjoy you. They are princes
==276== As goodly as your own eyes, and as noble
==277== As ever fame yet spoke of. Look upon ’em
==278== And if you can love, end this difference.
==279== I give consent.—Are you content too, princes?

**BOTH ARC. AND PAL.**
==280== With all our souls.

**THE.**
==280==            He that she refuses
==281== Must die then.

**BOTH ARC. AND PAL.**
==281==         Any death thou canst invent, Duke.

**PAL.**
==282== If I fall from that mouth, I fall with favor,
==283== And lovers yet unborn shall bless my ashes.

**ARC.**
==284== If she refuse me, yet my grave will wed me,
==285== And soldiers sing my epitaph.

**THE.**
==285==                 Make choice then.

**EMIL.**
==286== I cannot, sir, they are both too excellent:
==287== For me, a hair shall never fall of these men.

**HIP.**
==288== What will become of ’em?

**THE.**
==288==               Thus I ordain it,
==289== And by mine honor, once again it stands,
==290== Or both shall die: you shall both to your country,
==291== And each within this month, accompanied
==292== With three fair knights, appear again in this place,
==293== In which I’ll plant a pyramid; and whether,
==294== Before us that are here, can force his cousin
==295== By fair and knightly strength to touch the pillar,
==296== He shall enjoy her; the other lose his head,
==297== And all his friends; nor shall he grudge to fall,
==298== Nor think he dies with interest in this lady.
==299== Will this content ye?

**PAL.**
==299==            Yes. Here, cousin Arcite,
==300== I am friends again till that hour.

**ARC.**
==300==                   I embrace ye.

**THE.**
==301== Are you content, sister?

**EMIL.**
==301==               Yes, I must, sir,
==302== Else both miscarry.

**THE.**
==302==            Come shake hands again then,
==303== And take heed, as you are gentlemen, this quarrel
==304== Sleep till the hour prefix’d, and hold your course.

**PAL.**
==305== We dare not fail thee, Theseus.

**THE.**
==305==                   Come, I’ll give ye
==306== Now usage like to princes and to friends.
==307== When ye return, who wins I’ll settle here;
==308== Who loses, yet I’ll weep upon his bier.

*Exeunt.*
