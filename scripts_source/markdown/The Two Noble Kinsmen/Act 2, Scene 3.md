## Act 2, Scene 3
[[Act 2, Scene 2|← Act 2, Scene 2]] | [[Act 2, Scene 4|Act 2, Scene 4 →]]

*The country near Athens.*

*Enter Arcite.*

**ARC.**
==1==Banish’d the kingdom? ’Tis a benefit,
==2==A mercy I must thank ’em for; but banish’d
==3==The free enjoying of that face I die for⁠—
==4==O, ’twas a studied punishment, a death
==5==Beyond imagination! Such a vengeance
==6==That were I old and wicked, all my sins
==7==Could never pluck upon me. Palamon!
==8==Thou hast the start now; thou shalt stay and see
==9==Her bright eyes break each morning ’gainst thy window,
==10==And let in life into thee; thou shalt feed
==11==Upon the sweetness of a noble beauty,
==12==That nature nev’r exceeded, nor nev’r shall.
==13==Good gods! What happiness has Palamon!
==14==Twenty to one, he’ll come to speak to her,
==15==And if she be as gentle as she’s fair,
==16==I know she’s his; he has a tongue will tame tempests,
==17==And make the wild rocks wanton. Come what can come,
==18==The worst is death: I will not leave the kingdom.
==19==I know mine own is but a heap of ruins,
==20==And no redress there. If I go, he has her.
==21==I am resolv’d another shape shall make me,
==22==Or end my fortunes. Either way, I am happy:
==23==I’ll see her, and be near her, or no more.

*Retires.*

*Enter four Country People, and one with a garland before them.*

**1. COUN.**
==24==My masters, I’ll be there, that’s certain.

**2. COUN.**
==25==And I’ll be there.

**3. COUN.**
==26==And I.

**4. COUN.**
==27==Why then have with ye, boys! ’Tis but a chiding.
==28==Let the plough play today, I’ll tickle’t out
==29==Of the jades’ tails tomorrow.

**1. COUN.**
==29==                I am sure
==30==To have my wife as jealous as a turkey.
==31==But that’s all one, I’ll go through, let her mumble.

**2. COUN.**
==32==Clap her aboard tomorrow night, and stow her,
==33==And all’s made up again.

**3. COUN.**
==33==              Ay, do but put
==34==A fescue in her fist, and you shall see her
==35==Take a new lesson out, and be a good wench.
==36==Do we all hold against the Maying?

**4. COUN.**
==36==                  Hold?
==37==What should ail us?

**3. COUN.**
==37==           Arcas will be there.

**2. COUN.**
==37==                     And Sennois,
==38==And Rycas, and three better lads nev’r danc’d
==39==Under green tree; and ye know what wenches, ha?
==40==But will the dainty domine, the schoolmaster,
==41==Keep touch, do you think? For he does all, ye know.

**3. COUN.**
==42==He’ll eat a horn-book ere he fail. Go to!
==43==The matter’s too far driven between him
==44==And the tanner’s daughter to let slip now;
==45==And she must see the Duke, and she must dance too.

**4. COUN.**
==46==Shall we be lusty?

**2. COUN.**
==46==           All the boys in Athens
==47==Blow wind i’ th’ breech on ’s, and here I’ll be,
==48==And there I’ll be, for our town, and here again,
==49==And there again. Ha, boys, heigh for the weavers!

**1. COUN.**
==50==This must be done i’ th’ woods.

**4. COUN.**
==50==                  O, pardon me!

**2. COUN.**
==51==By any means; our thing of learning says so⁠—
==52==Where he himself will edify the Duke
==53==Most parlously in our behalfs. He’s excellent i’ th’ woods,
==54==Bring him to th’ plains, his learning makes no cry.

**3. COUN.**
==55==We’ll see the sports, then every man to ’s tackle!
==56==And, sweet companions, let’s rehearse by any means
==57==Before the ladies see us, and do sweetly,
==58==And God knows what may come on’t.

**4. COUN.**
==58==                     Content. The sports
==59==Once ended, we’ll perform. Away, boys, and hold!

**ARC.**
*(Comes forward.)*
==60==By your leaves, honest friends: pray you, whither go you?

**4. COUN.**
==61==Whither? Why, what a question’s that?

**ARC.**
==61==                     Yes, ’tis a question
==62==To me that know not.

**3. COUN.**
==62==           To the games, my friend.

**2. COUN.**
==63==Where were you bred you know it not?

**ARC.**
==63==                     Not far, sir.
==64==Are there such games today?

**1. COUN.**
==64==                Yes, marry, are there;
==65==And such as you never saw. The Duke himself
==66==Will be in person there.

**ARC.**
==66==              What pastimes are they?

**2. COUN.**
==67==Wrastling and running.—’Tis a pretty fellow.

**3. COUN.**
==68==Thou wilt not go along?

**ARC.**
==68==              Not yet, sir.

**4. COUN.**
==68==                       Well, sir,
==69==Take your own time. Come, boys.

**1. COUN.**
==69==                  My mind misgives me
==70==This fellow has a veng’ance trick o’ th’ hip,
==71==Mark how his body’s made for’t.

**2. COUN.**
==71==                  I’ll be hang’d though
==72==If he dare venture. Hang him, plum porridge!
==73==He wrestle? He roast eggs! Come let’s be gone, lads.

*Exeunt four Countrymen.*

**ARC.**
==74==This is an offer’d opportunity
==75==I durst not wish for. Well I could have wrestled,
==76==The best men call’d it excellent; and run
==77==Swifter than wind upon a field of corn,
==78==Curling the wealthy ears, never flew. I’ll venture,
==79==And in some poor disguise be there. Who knows
==80==Whether my brows may not be girt with garlands,
==81==And happiness prefer me to a place
==82==Where I may ever dwell in sight of her?

*Exit Arcite.*
