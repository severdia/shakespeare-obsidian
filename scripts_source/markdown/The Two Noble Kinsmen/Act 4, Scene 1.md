## Act 4, Scene 1
[[Act 3, Scene 6|← Act 3, Scene 6]] | [[Act 4, Scene 2|Act 4, Scene 2 →]]

*Athens. A room in the prison.*

*Enter Jailer and his Friend.*

**JAIL.**
==1==Hear you no more? Was nothing said of me
==2==Concerning the escape of Palamon?
==3==Good sir, remember.

**1. FRIEND.**
==3==           Nothing that I heard,
==4==For I came home before the business
==5==Was fully ended. Yet I might perceive,
==6==Ere I departed, a great likelihood
==7==Of both their pardons; for Hippolyta,
==8==And fair-ey’d Emily, upon their knees
==9==Begg’d with such handsome pity, that the Duke
==10==Methought stood staggering whether he should follow
==11==His rash oath, or the sweet compassion
==12==Of those two ladies; and to second them,
==13==That truly noble prince Pirithous,
==14==Half his own heart, set in too, that I hope
==15==All shall be well. Neither heard I one question
==16==Of your name, or his scape.

**JAIL.**
==16==              Pray heaven it hold so!

*Enter Second Friend.*

**2. FRIEND.**
==17==Be of good comfort, man; I bring you news,
==18==Good news.

**JAIL.**
==18==        They are welcome.

**2. FRIEND.**
==18==                  Palamon has clear’d you,
==19==And got your pardon, and discover’d how
==20==And by whose means he escap’d, which was your daughter’s,
==21==Whose pardon is procur’d too; and the prisoner⁠—
==22==Not to be held ungrateful to her goodness⁠—
==23==Has given a sum of money to her marriage,
==24==A large one, I’ll assure you.

**JAIL.**
==24==              Ye are a good man
==25==And ever bring good news.

**1. FRIEND.**
==25==              How was it ended?

**2. FRIEND.**
==26==Why, as it should be: they that nev’r begg’d
==27==But they prevail’d, had their suits fairly granted:
==28==The prisoners have their lives.

**1. FRIEND.**
==28==                I knew ’twould be so.

**2. FRIEND.**
==29==But there be new conditions, which you’ll hear of
==30==At better time.

**JAIL.**
==31==I hope they are good.

**2. FRIEND.**
==31==           They are honorable,
==32==How good they’ll prove, I know not.

**1. FRIEND.**
==32==                       ’Twill be known.

*Enter Wooer.*

**WOOER.**
==33==Alas, sir, where’s your daughter?

**JAIL.**
==33==                  Why do you ask?

**WOOER.**
==34==O sir, when did you see her?

**2. FRIEND.**
==34==                How he looks!

**JAIL.**
==35==This morning.

**WOOER.**
==35==        Was she well? Was she in health?
==36==Sir, when did she sleep?

**1. FRIEND.**
==36==              These are strange questions.

**JAIL.**
==37==I do not think she was very well, for, now
==38==You make me mind her, but this very day
==39==I ask’d her questions, and she answered me
==40==So far from what she was, so childishly,
==41==So sillily, as if she were a fool,
==42==An innocent, and I was very angry.
==43==But what of her, sir?

**WOOER.**
==43==           Nothing but my pity.
==44==But you must know it, and as good by me
==45==As by another that less loves her.

**JAIL.**
==45==                  Well, sir?

**1. FRIEND.**
==46==Not right?

**2. FRIEND.**
==46==        Not well?

**WOOER.**
==46==              No, sir, not well:
==47==’Tis too true, she is mad.

**1. FRIEND.**
==47==              It cannot be.

**WOOER.**
==48==Believe you’ll find it so.

**JAIL.**
==48==              I half suspected
==49==What you told me. The gods comfort her!
==50==Either this was her love to Palamon,
==51==Or fear of my miscarrying on his scape,
==52==Or both.

**WOOER.**
==52==        ’Tis likely.

**JAIL.**
==52==              But why all this haste, sir?

**WOOER.**
==53==I’ll tell you quickly. As I late was angling
==54==In the great lake that lies behind the palace,
==55==From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,
==56==As patiently I was attending sport,
==57==I heard a voice, a shrill one; and attentive
==58==I gave my ear, when I might well perceive
==59==’Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it,
==60==A boy or woman. I then left my angle
==61==To his own skill, came near, but yet perceiv’d not
==62==Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds
==63==Had so encompass’d it. I laid me down
==64==And list’ned to the words she sung, for then
==65==Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,
==66==I saw it was your daughter.

**JAIL.**
==66==              Pray go on, sir.

**WOOER.**
==67==She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her
==68==Repeat this often, “Palamon is gone,
==69==Is gone to th’ wood to gather mulberries.
==70==I’ll find him out tomorrow.”

**1. FRIEND.**
==70==                Pretty soul!

**WOOER.**
==71==“His shackles will betray him, he’ll be taken,
==72==And what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy,
==73==A hundred black-ey’d maids that love as I do,
==74==With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies,
==75==With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,
==76==And all we’ll dance an antic ’fore the Duke,
==77==And beg his pardon.” Then she talk’d of you, sir:
==78==That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,
==79==And she must gather flowers to bury you,
==80==And see the house made handsome. Then she sung
==81==Nothing but “Willow, willow, willow,” and between
==82==Ever was “Palamon, fair Palamon,”
==83==And “Palamon was a tall young man.” The place
==84==Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses
==85==A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck
==86==Thousand fresh water-flowers of several colors,
==87==That methought she appear’d like the fair nymph
==88==That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris
==89==Newly dropp’d down from heaven. Rings she made
==90==Of rushes that grew by, and to ’em spoke
==91==The prettiest posies—“Thus our true love’s tied,”
==92==“This you may loose, not me,” and many a one;
==93==And then she wept, and sung again, and sigh’d,
==94==And with the same breath smil’d, and kiss’d her hand.

**2. FRIEND.**
==95==Alas, what pity it is!

**WOOER.**
==95==           I made in to her.
==96==She saw me, and straight sought the flood. I sav’d her,
==97==And set her safe to land; when presently
==98==She slipp’d away, and to the city made
==99==With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,
==100==She left me far behind her. Three or four
==101==I saw from far off cross her—one of ’em
==102==I knew to be your brother; where she stay’d,
==103==And fell, scarce to be got away. I left them with her,
==104==And hither came to tell you.
*(Enter Jailer’s Brother, Daughter, and others.)*
==104==                Here they are.

**DAUGH.**
*(Sings.)*
==105== *“May you never more enjoy the light,” etc.*
==106==Is not this a fine song?

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==106==              O, a very fine one!

**DAUGH.**
==107==I can sing twenty more.

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==107==              I think you can.

**DAUGH.**
==108==Yes, truly, can I. I can sing “The Broom,”
==109==And “Bonny Robin.” Are not you a tailor?

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==110==Yes.

**DAUGH.**
==110==    Where’s my wedding gown?

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==110==                  I’ll bring it tomorrow.

**DAUGH.**
==111==Do, very rearly, I must be abroad else,
==112==To call the maids and pay the minstrels,
==113==For I must lose my maidenhead by cocklight,
==114==’Twill never thrive else.
*(Sings.)*
==115== *“O fair, O sweet,” etc.*

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==116==You must ev’n take it patiently.

**JAIL.**
==116==                  ’Tis true.

**DAUGH.**
==117==Good ev’n, good men. Pray did you ever hear
==118==Of one young Palamon?

**JAIL.**
==118==              Yes, wench, we know him.

**DAUGH.**
==119==Is’t not a fine young gentleman?

**JAIL.**
==119==                  ’Tis, love.

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==120==By no mean cross her, she is then distemper’d
==121==Far worse than now she shows.

**1. FRIEND.**
==121==                  Yes, he’s a fine man.

**DAUGH.**
==122==O, is he so? You have a sister?

**1. FRIEND.**
==122==                Yes.

**DAUGH.**
==123==But she shall never have him, tell her so,
==124==For a trick that I know. Y’ had best look to her,
==125==For if she see him once, she’s gone—she’s done,
==126==And undone in an hour. All the young maids
==127==Of our town are in love with him, but I laugh at ’em
==128==And let ’em all alone. Is’t not a wise course?

**1. FRIEND.**
==129==Yes.

**DAUGH.**
==130==There is at least two hundred now with child by him⁠—
==131==There must be four. Yet I keep close for all this,
==132==Close as a cockle. And all these must be boys,
==133==He has the trick on’t; and at ten years old
==134==They must be all gelt for musicians,
==135==And sing the wars of Theseus.

**2. FRIEND.**
==135==                This is strange.

**DAUGH.**
==136==As ever you heard, but say nothing.

**1. FRIEND.**
==136==                     No.

**DAUGH.**
==137==They come from all parts of the dukedom to him.
==138==I’ll warrant ye he had not so few last night
==139==As twenty to dispatch. He’ll tickle’t up
==140==In two hours, if his hand be in.

**JAIL.**
==140==                  She’s lost
==141==Past all cure.

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==141==        Heaven forbid, man!

**DAUGH.**
*(To the Jailer.)*
==142==Come hither, you are a wise man.

**1. FRIEND.**
==142==                  Does she know him?

**2. FRIEND.**
==143==No, would she did!

**DAUGH.**
==143==           You are master of a ship?

**JAIL.**
==144==Yes.

**DAUGH.**
==144==    Where’s your compass?

**JAIL.**
==144==                Here.

**DAUGH.**
==144==                     Set it to th’ north.
==145==And now direct your course to th’ wood, where Palamon
==146==Lies longing for me. For the tackling
==147==Let me alone. Come weigh, my hearts, cheerly!

**ALL.**
==148==Owgh, owgh, owgh! ’Tis up! The wind’s fair.
==149==Top the bowling! Out with the mainsail!
==150==Where’s your whistle, master?

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==150==                Let’s get her in.

**JAIL.**
==151==Up to the top, boy!

**JAIL. BROTH.**
==151==           Where’s the pilot?

**1. FRIEND.**
==151==                         Here.

**DAUGH.**
==152==What ken’st thou?

**2. FRIEND.**
==152==           A fair wood.

**DAUGH.**
==152==                  Bear for it, master.
==153==Tack about!
*(Sings.)*
==154== *“When Cynthia with her borrowed light,” etc.*

*Exeunt.*
