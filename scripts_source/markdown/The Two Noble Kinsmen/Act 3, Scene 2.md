## Act 3, Scene 2
[[Act 3, Scene 1|← Act 3, Scene 1]] | [[Act 3, Scene 3|Act 3, Scene 3 →]]

*Another part of the forest near Athens.*

*Enter Jailer’s Daughter alone.*

**DAUGH.**
==1==He has mistook the brake I meant, is gone
==2==After his fancy. ’Tis now well-nigh morning;
==3==No matter, would it were perpetual night,
==4==And darkness lord o’ th’ world! Hark, ’tis a wolf!
==5==In me hath grief slain fear, and but for one thing,
==6==I care for nothing, and that’s Palamon.
==7==I reck not if the wolves would jaw me, so
==8==He had this file. What if I hallow’d for him?
==9==I cannot hallow. If I whoop’d, what then?
==10==If he not answer’d, I should call a wolf,
==11==And do him but that service. I have heard
==12==Strange howls this livelong night; why may’t not be
==13==They have made prey of him? He has no weapons,
==14==He cannot run, the jingling of his gyves
==15==Might call fell things to listen, who have in them
==16==A sense to know a man unarm’d, and can
==17==Smell where resistance is. I’ll set it down
==18==He’s torn to pieces. They howl’d many together,
==19==And then they fed on him. So much for that,
==20==Be bold to ring the bell. How stand I then?
==21==All’s char’d when he is gone. No, no, I lie:
==22==My father’s to be hang’d for his escape,
==23==Myself to beg, if I priz’d life so much
==24==As to deny my act, but that I would not,
==25==Should I try death by dozens. I am mop’d:
==26==Food took I none these two days⁠—
==27==Sipp’d some water. I have not clos’d mine eyes
==28==Save when my lids scour’d off their brine. Alas,
==29==Dissolve, my life, let not my sense unsettle
==30==Lest I should drown, or stab, or hang myself.
==31==O state of nature, fail together in me,
==32==Since thy best props are warp’d! So which way now?
==33==The best way is, the next way to a grave;
==34==Each errant step beside is torment. Lo
==35==The moon is down, the crickets chirp, the screech owl
==36==Calls in the dawn! All offices are done
==37==Save what I fail in. But the point is this⁠—
==38==An end, and that is all.

*Exit.*
