## Act 2, Scene 4
[[Act 2, Scene 3|← Act 2, Scene 3]] | [[Act 2, Scene 5|Act 2, Scene 5 →]]

*Athens. A room in the prison.*

*Enter Jailer’s Daughter alone.*

**DAUGH.**
==1== Why should I love this gentleman? ’Tis odds
==2== He never will affect me. I am base,
==3== My father the mean keeper of his prison,
==4== And he a prince. To marry him is hopeless;
==5== To be his whore is witless. Out upon’t!
==6== What pushes are we wenches driven to
==7== When fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him:
==8== I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;
==9== He has as much to please a woman in him
==10== (If he please to bestow it so) as ever
==11== These eyes yet look’d on. Next, I pitied him;
==12== And so would any young wench o’ my conscience
==13== That ever dream’d, or vow’d her maidenhead
==14== To a young handsome man. Then, I lov’d him,
==15== Extremely lov’d him, infinitely lov’d him;
==16== And yet he had a cousin, fair as he too;
==17== But in my heart was Palamon, and there,
==18== Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him
==19== Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is!
==20== And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken
==21== Was never gentleman. When I come in
==22== To bring him water in a morning, first
==23== He bows his noble body, then salutes me thus:
==24== “Fair gentle maid, good morrow. May thy goodness
==25== Get thee a happy husband!” Once he kiss’d me⁠—
==26== I lov’d my lips the better ten days after.
==27== Would he would do so ev’ry day! He grieves much,
==28== And me as much to see his misery.
==29== What should I do to make him know I love him,
==30== For I would fain enjoy him? Say I ventur’d
==31== To set him free? What says the law then?
==32== Thus much for law or kindred! I will do it,
==33== And this night, or tomorrow, he shall love me.

*Exit.*
