## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*Another part of the forest near Athens.*

*Enter Jailer’s Daughter.*

**DAUGH.**
I am very cold, and all the stars are out too,
The little stars and all, that look like aglets.
The sun has seen my folly. Palamon!
Alas, no; he’s in heaven. Where am I now?
Yonder’s the sea, and there’s a ship. How’t tumbles!
And there’s a rock lies watching under water;
Now, now, it beats upon it—now, now, now!
There’s a leak sprung, a sound one. How they cry!
Open her before the wind! You’ll lose all else.
Up with a course or two, and tack about, boys!
Good night, good night, y’ are gone. I am very hungry:
Would I could find a fine frog! He would tell me
News from all parts o’ th’ world. Then would I make
A carreck of a cockleshell, and sail
By east and north-east to the King of Pigmies,
For he tells fortunes rarely. Now my father,
Twenty to one, is truss’d up in a trice
Tomorrow morning; I’ll say never a word.
*(Sing.)*
*“For I’ll cut my green coat a foot above my knee,*
*And I’ll clip my yellow locks an inch below mine e’e.*
*Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny.*
*He s’ buy me a white cut, forth for to ride,*
*And I’ll go seek him through the world that is so wide.*
*Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny.”*
O for a prick now, like a nightingale,
To put my breast against! I shall sleep like a top else.

*Exit.*
