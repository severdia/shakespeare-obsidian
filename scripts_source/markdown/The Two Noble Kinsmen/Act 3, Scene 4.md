## Act 3, Scene 4
[[Act 3, Scene 3|← Act 3, Scene 3]] | [[Act 3, Scene 5|Act 3, Scene 5 →]]

*Another part of the forest near Athens.*

*Enter Jailer’s Daughter.*

**DAUGH.**
==1==I am very cold, and all the stars are out too,
==2==The little stars and all, that look like aglets.
==3==The sun has seen my folly. Palamon!
==4==Alas, no; he’s in heaven. Where am I now?
==5==Yonder’s the sea, and there’s a ship. How’t tumbles!
==6==And there’s a rock lies watching under water;
==7==Now, now, it beats upon it—now, now, now!
==8==There’s a leak sprung, a sound one. How they cry!
==9==Open her before the wind! You’ll lose all else.
==10==Up with a course or two, and tack about, boys!
==11==Good night, good night, y’ are gone. I am very hungry:
==12==Would I could find a fine frog! He would tell me
==13==News from all parts o’ th’ world. Then would I make
==14==A carreck of a cockleshell, and sail
==15==By east and north-east to the King of Pigmies,
==16==For he tells fortunes rarely. Now my father,
==17==Twenty to one, is truss’d up in a trice
==18==Tomorrow morning; I’ll say never a word.
*(Sing.)*
==19== *“For I’ll cut my green coat a foot above my knee,*
==20== *And I’ll clip my yellow locks an inch below mine e’e.*
==21==    *Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny.*
==22== *He s’ buy me a white cut, forth for to ride,*
==23== *And I’ll go seek him through the world that is so wide.*
==24==    *Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny.”*
==25==O for a prick now, like a nightingale,
==26==To put my breast against! I shall sleep like a top else.

*Exit.*
