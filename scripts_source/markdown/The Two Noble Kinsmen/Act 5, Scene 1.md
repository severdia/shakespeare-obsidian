## Act 5, Scene 1
[[Act 4, Scene 3|← Act 4, Scene 3]] | [[Act 5, Scene 2|Act 5, Scene 2 →]]

*Before the Temples of Mars, Venus, and Diana.*

*Three altars erected—to Mars, Venus, and Diana. Flourish. Enter Theseus, Pirithous, Hippolyta, Attendants.*

**THE.**
==1==Now let ’em enter, and before the gods
==2==Tender their holy prayers. Let the temples
==3==Burn bright with sacred fires, and the altars
==4==In hallowed clouds commend their swelling incense
==5==To those above us. Let no due be wanting;
==6==They have a noble work in hand will honor
==7==The very powers that love ’em.

*Flourish of cornets. Enter Palamon and Arcite and their Knights.*

**PIR.**
==7==                  Sir, they enter.

**THE.**
==8==You valiant and strong-hearted enemies,
==9==You royal germane foes, that this day come
==10==To blow that nearness out that flames between ye,
==11==Lay by your anger for an hour, and dove-like,
==12==Before the holy altars of your helpers,
==13==The all-fear’d gods, bow down your stubborn bodies.
==14==Your ire is more than mortal; so your help be;
==15==And as the gods regard ye, fight with justice.
==16==I’ll leave you to your prayers, and betwixt ye
==17==I part my wishes.

**PIR.**
==17==           Honor crown the worthiest!

*Exeunt Theseus and his Train.*

**PAL.**
==18==The glass is running now that cannot finish
==19==Till one of us expire. Think you but thus,
==20==That were there aught in me which strove to show
==21==Mine enemy in this business, were’t one eye
==22==Against another, arm oppress’d by arm,
==23==I would destroy th’ offender, coz, I would,
==24==Though parcel of myself. Then from this gather
==25==How I should tender you.

**ARC.**
==25==              I am in labor
==26==To push your name, your ancient love, our kindred,
==27==Out of my memory; and i’ th’ self-same place
==28==To seat something I would confound. So hoist we
==29==The sails that must these vessels port even where
==30==The heavenly limiter pleases.

**PAL.**
==30==                You speak well.
==31==Before I turn, let me embrace thee, cousin.
*(They embrace.)*
==32==This I shall never do again.

**ARC.**
==32==                One farewell.

**PAL.**
==33==Why, let it be so; farewell, coz.

**ARC.**
==33==                  Farewell, sir.
*(Exeunt Palamon and his Knights.)*
==34==Knights, kinsmen, lovers, yea, my sacrifices,
==35==True worshippers of Mars, whose spirit in you
==36==Expels the seeds of fear, and th’ apprehension
==37==Which still is farther off it, go with me
==38==Before the god of our profession. There
==39==Require of him the hearts of lions and
==40==The breath of tigers, yea, the fierceness too,
==41==Yea, the speed also—to go on, I mean,
==42==Else wish we to be snails. You know my prize
==43==Must be dragg’d out of blood; force and great feat
==44==Must put my garland on, where she sticks
==45==The queen of flowers. Our intercession then
==46==Must be to him that makes the camp a cistern
==47==Brimm’d with the blood of men. Give me your aid
==48==And bend your spirits towards him.
*(They advance to the altar of Mars and fall on their faces; then kneel.)*
==49==Thou mighty one, that with thy power hast turn’d
==50==Green Neptune into purple; whose approach
==51==Comets prewarn, whose havoc in vast field
==52==Unearthed skulls proclaim, whose breath blows down
==53==The teeming Ceres’ foison, who dost pluck
==54==With hand armipotent from forth blue clouds
==55==The mason’d turrets, that both mak’st and break’st
==56==The stony girths of cities: me thy pupil,
==57==Youngest follower of thy drum, instruct this day
==58==With military skill, that to thy laud
==59==I may advance my streamer, and by thee
==60==Be styl’d the lord o’ th’ day. Give me, great Mars,
==61==Some token of thy pleasure.
*(Here they fall on their faces as formerly, and there is heard clanging of armor, with a short thunder, as the burst of a battle, whereupon they all rise and bow to the altar.)*
==62==O great corrector of enormous times,
==63==Shaker of o’er-rank states, thou grand decider
==64==Of dusty and old titles, that heal’st with blood
==65==The earth when it is sick, and cur’st the world
==66==O’ th’ plurisy of people! I do take
==67==Thy signs auspiciously, and in thy name
==68==To my design march boldly.—Let us go.

*Exeunt.*

*Enter Palamon and his Knights, with the former observance.*

**PAL.**
==69==Our stars must glister with new fire, or be
==70==Today extinct. Our argument is love,
==71==Which if the goddess of it grant, she gives
==72==Victory too. Then blend your spirits with mine,
==73==You whose free nobleness do make my cause
==74==Your personal hazard. To the goddess Venus
==75==Commend we our proceeding, and implore
==76==Her power unto our party.
*(Here they advance to the altar of Venus, and fall on their faces; then kneel, as formerly.)*
==77==Hail, sovereign queen of secrets, who hast power
==78==To call the fiercest tyrant from his rage,
==79==And weep unto a girl; that hast the might,
==80==Even with an eye-glance, to choke Mars’s drum
==81==And turn th’ alarm to whispers; that canst make
==82==A cripple flourish with his crutch, and cure him
==83==Before Apollo; that mayst force the king
==84==To be his subject’s vassal, and induce
==85==Stale gravity to dance; the poll’d bachelor,
==86==Whose youth, like wanton boys through bonfires,
==87==Have skipp’d thy flame, at seventy thou canst catch,
==88==And make him, to the scorn of his hoarse throat,
==89==Abuse young lays of love. What godlike power
==90==Hast thou not power upon? To Phoebus thou
==91==Add’st flames, hotter than his; the heavenly fires
==92==Did scorch his mortal son, thine him. The huntress
==93==All moist and cold, some say, began to throw
==94==Her bow away, and sigh. Take to thy grace
==95==Me thy vow’d soldier, who do bear thy yoke
==96==As ’twere a wreath of roses, yet is heavier
==97==Than lead itself, stings more than nettles. I
==98==Have never been foul-mouth’d against thy law,
==99==Nev’r reveal’d secret, for I knew none—would not,
==100==Had I kenn’d all that were. I never practiced
==101==Upon man’s wife, nor would the libels read
==102==Of liberal wits. I never at great feasts
==103==Sought to betray a beauty, but have blush’d
==104==At simp’ring sirs that did. I have been harsh
==105==To large confessors, and have hotly ask’d them
==106==If they had mothers; I had one, a woman,
==107==And women ’twere they wrong’d. I knew a man
==108==Of eighty winters—this I told them—who
==109==A lass of fourteen brided. ’Twas thy power
==110==To put life into dust: the aged cramp
==111==Had screw’d his square foot round,
==112==The gout had knit his fingers into knots,
==113==Torturing convulsions from his globy eyes
==114==Had almost drawn their spheres, that what was life
==115==In him seem’d torture. This anatomy
==116==Had by his young fair fere a boy, and I
==117==Believ’d it was his, for she swore it was,
==118==And who would not believe her? Brief, I am
==119==To those that prate and have done, no companion;
==120==To those that boast and have not, a defier;
==121==To those that would and cannot, a rejoicer.
==122==Yea, him I do not love that tells close offices
==123==The foulest way, nor names concealments in
==124==The boldest language. Such a one I am,
==125==And vow that lover never yet made sigh
==126==Truer than I. O then, most soft sweet goddess,
==127==Give me the victory of this question, which
==128==Is true love’s merit, and bless me with a sign
==129==Of thy great pleasure.
*(Here music is heard; doves are seen to flutter. They fall again upon their faces, then on their knees.)*
==130==O thou that from eleven to ninety reign’st
==131==In mortal bosoms, whose chase is this world,
==132==And we in herds thy game, I give thee thanks
==133==For this fair token, which being laid unto
==134==Mine innocent true heart, arms in assurance
==135==My body to this business.—Let us rise
==136==And bow before the goddess. Time comes on.

*They bow. Exeunt.*

*Still music of records. Enter Emilia in white, her hair about her shoulders, and wearing a wheaten wreath; one in white holding up her train, her hair stuck with flowers; one before her carrying a silver hind, in which is convey’d incense and sweet odors, which being set upon the altar of Diana, her maids standing aloof, she sets fire to it; then they curtsy and kneel.*

**EMIL.**
==137==O sacred, shadowy, cold, and constant queen,
==138==Abandoner of revels, mute, contemplative,
==139==Sweet, solitary, white as chaste, and pure
==140==As wind-fann’d snow, who to thy female knights
==141==Allow’st no more blood than will make a blush,
==142==Which is their order’s robe: I here, thy priest,
==143==Am humbled ’fore thine altar. O, vouchsafe,
==144==With that thy rare green eye—which never yet
==145==Beheld thing maculate—look on thy virgin,
==146==And, sacred silver mistress, lend thine ear
==147==(Which nev’r heard scurril term, into whose port
==148==Ne’er ent’red wanton sound) to my petition,
==149==Season’d with holy fear. This is my last
==150==Of vestal office; I am bride-habited,
==151==But maiden-hearted. A husband I have ’pointed,
==152==But do not know him. Out of two I should
==153==Choose one, and pray for his success, but I
==154==Am guiltless of election. Of mine eyes
==155==Were I to lose one, they are equal precious,
==156==I could doom neither; that which perish’d should
==157==Go to’t unsentenc’d. Therefore, most modest queen,
==158==He of the two pretenders that best loves me
==159==And has the truest title in’t, let him
==160==Take off my wheaten garland, or else grant
==161==The file and quality I hold I may
==162==Continue in thy band.
*(Here the hind vanishes under the altar, and in the place ascends a rose tree, having one rose upon it.)*
==163==See what our general of ebbs and flows
==164==Out from the bowels of her holy altar
==165==With sacred act advances: but one rose!
==166==If well inspir’d, this battle shall confound
==167==Both these brave knights, and I, a virgin flow’r,
==168==Must grow alone, unpluck’d.
*(Here is heard a sudden twang of instruments, and the rose falls from the tree, which vanishes under the altar.)*
==169==The flow’r is fall’n, the tree descends. O mistress,
==170==Thou here dischargest me. I shall be gather’d,
==171==I think so, but I know not thine own will:
==172==Unclasp thy mystery.—I hope she’s pleas’d,
==173==Her signs were gracious.

*They curtsy and exeunt.*
