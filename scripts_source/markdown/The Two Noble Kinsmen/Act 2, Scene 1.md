## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 5|← Act 1, Scene 5]] | [[Act 2, Scene 2|Act 2, Scene 2 →]]

*Athens. A garden, with a prison in the background.*

*Enter Jailer and Wooer.*

**JAIL.**
==1== I may depart with little, while I live; something I may cast to you, not much. Alas, the prison I keep, though it be for great ones, yet they seldom come: before one salmon, you shall take a number of minnows. I am given out to be better lin’d than it can appear to me report is a true speaker. I would I were really that I am deliver’d to be. Marry, what I have (be it what it will) I will assure upon my daughter at the day of my death.

**WOOER.**
==2== Sir, I demand no more than your own offer, and I will estate your daughter in what I have promis’d.

**JAIL.**
==3== Well, we will talk more of this when the solemnity is past. But have you a full promise of her? When that shall be seen, I tender my consent.

*Enter Daughter with strewings.*

**WOOER.**
==4== I have, sir. Here she comes.

**JAIL.**
==5== Your friend and I have chanc’d to name you here, upon the old business. But no more of that now; so soon as the court hurry is over, we will have an end of it. I’ th’ mean time, look tenderly to the two prisoners. I can tell you they are princes.

**DAUGH.**
==6== These strewings are for their chamber. ’Tis pity they are in prison, and ’twere pity they should be out. I do think they have patience to make any adversity asham’d. The prison itself is proud of ’em; and they have all the world in their chamber.

**JAIL.**
==7== They are fam’d to be a pair of absolute men.

**DAUGH.**
==8== By my troth, I think fame but stammers ’em, they stand a grise above the reach of report.

**JAIL.**
==9== I heard them reported in the battle to be the only doers.

**DAUGH.**
==10== Nay, most likely, for they are noble suff’rers. I marvel how they would have look’d had they been victors, that with such a constant nobility enforce a freedom out of bondage, making misery their mirth, and affliction a toy to jest at.

**JAIL.**
==11== Do they so?

**DAUGH.**
==12== It seems to me they have no more sense of their captivity than I of ruling Athens. They eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but nothing of their own restraint and disasters. Yet sometime a divided sigh, martyr’d as ’twere i’ th’ deliverance, will break from one of them; when the other presently gives it so sweet a rebuke that I could wish myself a sigh to be so chid, or at least a sigher to be comforted.

**WOOER.**
==13== I never saw ’em.

**JAIL.**
==14== The Duke himself came privately in the night, and so did they. What the reason of it is, I know not.
*(Enter Palamon and Arcite above.)*
==15== Look yonder they are! That’s Arcite looks out.

**DAUGH.**
==16== No, sir, no, that’s Palamon. Arcite is the lower of the twain; you may perceive a part of him.

**JAIL.**
==17== Go to, leave your pointing. They would not make us their object. Out of their sight.

**DAUGH.**
==18== It is a holiday to look on them. Lord, the diff’rence of men!

*Exeunt Jailer, Wooer, and Daughter.*
