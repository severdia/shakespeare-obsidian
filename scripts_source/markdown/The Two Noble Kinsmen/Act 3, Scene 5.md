## Act 3, Scene 5
[[Act 3, Scene 4|← Act 3, Scene 4]] | [[Act 3, Scene 6|Act 3, Scene 6 →]]

*Another part of the forest near Athens.*

*Enter a Schoolmaster Gerald, four Countrymen as Morris-dancers and another as the Bavian, five Wenches (Nell, Friz, Maudline, Luce and Barbary), with a Taborer.*

**SCHOOL.**
==1== Fie, fie,
==2== What tediosity and disensanity
==3== Is here among ye! Have my rudiments
==4== Been labor’d so long with ye, milk’d unto ye,
==5== And by a figure, even the very plum-broth
==6== And marrow of my understanding laid upon ye,
==7== And do you still cry, “Where?” and “How?” and “Wherefore?”
==8== You most coarse frieze capacities, ye jane judgments,
==9== Have I said, “Thus let be,” and “There let be,”
==10== And “Then let be,” and no man understand me?
==11== *Proh Deum, medius fidius*, ye are all dunces!
==12== For why, here stand I; here the Duke comes; there are you,
==13== Close in the thicket. The Duke appears, I meet him
==14== And unto him I utter learned things,
==15== And many figures; he hears, and nods, and hums,
==16== And then cries, “Rare!” and I go forward. At length
==17== I fling my cap up; mark there! Then do you,
==18== As once did Meleager and the boar,
==19== Break comely out before him; like true lovers,
==20== Cast yourselves in a body decently,
==21== And sweetly, by a figure, trace and turn, boys.

**1. COUN.**
==22== And sweetly we will do it, Master Gerald.

**2. COUN.**
==23== Draw up the company. Where’s the taborer?

**3. COUN.**
==24== Why, Timothy!

**TABORER.**
==24==         Here, my mad boys, have at ye!

**SCHOOL.**
==25== But I say, where’s their women?

**4. COUN.**
==25==                   Here’s Friz and Maudline.

**2. COUN.**
==26== And little Luce with the white legs, and bouncing Barbary.

**1. COUN.**
==27== And freckled Nell—that never fail’d her master.

**SCHOOL.**
==28== Where be your ribands, maids? Swim with your bodies,
==29== And carry it sweetly and deliverly,
==30== And now and then a favor and a frisk.

**NELL.**
==31== Let us alone, sir.

**SCHOOL.**
==31==            Where’s the rest o’ th’ music?

**3. COUN.**
==32== Dispers’d as you commanded.

**SCHOOL.**
==32==                 Couple then,
==33== And see what’s wanting. Where’s the Bavian?
==34== My friend, carry your tail without offense
==35== Or scandal to the ladies; and be sure
==36== You tumble with audacity and manhood,
==37== And when you bark, do it with judgment.

**BAVIAN.**
==37==                        Yes, sir.

**SCHOOL.**
==38== *Quo usque tandem*? Here is a woman wanting.

**4. COUN.**
==39== We may go whistle; all the fat’s i’ th’ fire.

**SCHOOL.**
==40== We have, as learned authors utter, wash’d a tile,
==41== We have been *fatuus*, and labored vainly.

**2. COUN.**
==42== This is that scornful piece, that scurvy hilding,
==43== That gave her promise faithfully she would
==44== Be here, Cicely the sempster’s daughter.
==45== The next gloves that I give her shall be dogskin;
==46== Nay, and she fail me once—You can tell, Arcas,
==47== She swore by wine and bread she would not break.

**SCHOOL.**
==48== An eel and woman,
==49== A learned poet says, unless by th’ tail
==50== And with thy teeth thou hold, will either fail.
==51== In manners this was false position.

**1. COUN.**
==52== A fire ill take her! Does she flinch now?

**3. COUN.**
==52==                      What
==53== Shall we determine, sir?

**SCHOOL.**
==53==               Nothing,
==54== Our business is become a nullity,
==55== Yea, and a woeful and a piteous nullity.

**4. COUN.**
==56== Now when the credit of our town lay on it,
==57== Now to be frampal, now to piss o’ th’ nettle!
==58== Go thy ways, I’ll remember thee, I’ll fit thee!

*Enter Jailer’s Daughter.*

**DAUGH.**
*(Sings.)*
==59== *“The George Alow came from the south,*
==60== *From the coast of Barbary-a;*
==61== *And there he met with brave gallants of war,*
==62== *By one, by two, by three-a.*
==63== *Well hail’d, well hail’d, you jolly gallants!*
==64== *And whither now are you bound-a?*
==65== *O, let me have your company*
==66== *Till I come to the sound-a.”*
==67== *“There was three fools fell out about an howlet:*
==68== *The one said it was an owl,*
==69== *The other he said nay,*
==70== *The third he said it was a hawk,*
==71== *And her bells were cut away.”*

**3. COUN.**
==72== There’s a dainty mad woman, master,
==73== Comes i’ th’ nick, as mad as a March hare.
==74== If we can get her dance, we are made again.
==75== I warrant her, she’ll do the rarest gambols.

**1. COUN.**
==76== A mad woman? We are made, boys!

**SCHOOL.**
==77== And are you mad, good woman?

**DAUGH.**
==77==                   I would be sorry else.
==78== Give me your hand.

**SCHOOL.**
==78==            Why?

**DAUGH.**
==78==                 I can tell your fortune.
==79== You are a fool. Tell ten—I have pos’d him. Buzz!
==80== Friend, you must eat no white bread; if you do,
==81== Your teeth will bleed extremely. Shall we dance ho?
==82== I know you, y’ are a tinker. Sirrah tinker,
==83== Stop no more holes but what you should.

**SCHOOL.**
==83==                        *Dii boni!*
==84== A tinker, damsel?

**DAUGH.**
==84==            Or a conjurer.
==85== Raise me a devil now, and let him play
==86== *Qui passa* o’ th’ bells and bones.

**SCHOOL.**
==86==                   Go take her,
==87== And fluently persuade her to a peace.
==88== *“Et opus exegi, quod nec Jovis ira, nec ignis”—*
==89== Strike up, and lead her in.

**2. COUN.**
==89==               Come, lass, let’s trip it.

**DAUGH.**
==90== I’ll lead.

**3. COUN.**
==91== Do, do.

**SCHOOL.**
==92== Persuasively and cunningly.
*(Wind horns.)*
==92==                 Away, boys!
==93== I hear the horns. Give me some meditation,
==94== And mark your cue.
*(Exeunt all but Schoolmaster.)*
==94==            Pallas inspire me!

*Enter Theseus, Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia, Arcite, and Train.*

**THE.**
==95== This way the stag took.

**SCHOOL.**
==95==               Stay, and edify.

**THE.**
==96== What have we here?

**PIR.**
==97== Some country sport, upon my life, sir.

**THE.**
==98== Well, sir, go forward, we will edify.
==99== Ladies, sit down, we’ll stay it.

**SCHOOL.**
==100== Thou doughty Duke, all hail! All hail, sweet ladies!

**THE.**
==101== This is a cold beginning.

**SCHOOL.**
==102== If you but favor, our country pastime made is.
==103== We are a few of those collected here
==104== That ruder tongues distinguish villager,
==105== And to say verity, and not to fable,
==106== We are a merry rout, or else a rable,
==107== Or company, or by a figure, choris,
==108== That ’fore thy dignity will dance a Morris.
==109== And I, that am the rectifier of all,
==110== By title *paedagogus*, that let fall
==111== The birch upon the breeches of the small ones,
==112== And humble with a ferula the tall ones,
==113== Do here present this machine, or this frame,
==114== And, dainty Duke, whose doughty dismal fame
==115== From Dis to Daedalus, from post to pillar,
==116== Is blown abroad, help me, thy poor well-willer,
==117== And with thy twinkling eyes look right and straight
==118== Upon this mighty Morr—of mickle weight⁠—
==119== Is—now comes in, which being glu’d together
==120== Makes Morris, and the cause that we came hither.
==121== The body of our sport, of no small study,
==122== I first appear, though rude, and raw, and muddy,
==123== To speak, before thy noble Grace, this tenner;
==124== At whose great feet I offer up my penner.
==125== The next, the Lord of May and Lady bright,
==126== The Chambermaid and Servingman, by night
==127== That seek out silent hanging. Then mine Host
==128== And his fat spouse, that welcomes to their cost
==129== The galled traveler, and with a beck’ning
==130== Informs the tapster to inflame the reck’ning.
==131== Then the beast-eating Clown, and next the Fool,
==132== The Bavian, with long tail and eke long tool,
==133== *Cum multis aliis* that make a dance.
==134== Say “Ay,” and all shall presently advance.

**THE.**
==135== Ay, ay, by any means, dear domine.

**PIR.**
==136== Produce.

**SCHOOL.**
*(Knock for school.)*
==137== *Intrate, filii*; come forth, and foot it.
*(Enter the Dancers. Music. Dance.)*
==138== Ladies, if we have been merry,
==139== And have pleas’d ye with a derry,
==140== And a derry, and a down,
==141== Say the schoolmaster’s no clown.
==142== Duke, if we have pleas’d thee too
==143== And have done as good boys should do,
==144== Give us but a tree or twain
==145== For a Maypole, and again,
==146== Ere another year run out,
==147== We’ll make thee laugh and all this rout.

**THE.**
==148== Take twenty, domine.—How does my sweet heart?

**HIP.**
==149== Never so pleas’d, sir.

**EMIL.**
==150== ’Twas an excellent dance, and for a preface,
==151== I never heard a better.

**THE.**
==151==            Schoolmaster, I thank you.
==152== One see ’em all rewarded.

**PIR.**
==152==               And here’s something
*(Gives money.)*
==153== To paint your pole withal.

**THE.**
==153==               Now to our sports again.

**SCHOOL.**
==154== May the stag thou hunt’st stand long,
==155== And thy dogs be swift and strong!
==156== May they kill him without lets,
==157== And the ladies eat his dowsets!
*(Exeunt Theseus and his company. Wind horns.)*
==158== Come, we are all made. *Dii deaeque omnes*!
==159== Ye have danc’d rarely, wenches.

*Exeunt.*
