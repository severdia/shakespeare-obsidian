**EPILOGUE**
I would now ask ye how ye like the play,
But as it is with schoolboys, cannot say;
I am cruel fearful. Pray yet stay a while,
And let me look upon ye. No man smile?
Then it goes hard, I see. He that has
Lov’d a young handsome wench then, show his face⁠—
’Tis strange if none be here—and if he will
Against his conscience, let him hiss, and kill
Our market. ’Tis in vain, I see, to stay ye;
Have at the worst can come, then! Now what say ye?
And yet mistake me not: I am not bold,
We have no such cause. If the tale we have told
(For ’tis no other) any way content ye
(For to that honest purpose it was meant ye),
We have our end; and ye shall have ere long
I dare say many a better, to prolong
Your old loves to us. We, and all our might,
Rest at your service. Gentlemen, good night.


*Flourish.*
