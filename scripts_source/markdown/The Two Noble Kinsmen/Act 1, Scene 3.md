## Act 1, Scene 3
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 1, Scene 4|Act 1, Scene 4 →]]

*Before the gates of Athens.*

*Enter Pirithous, Hippolyta, Emilia.*

**PIR.**
==1==No further.

**HIP.**
==1==        Sir, farewell. Repeat my wishes
==2==To our great lord, of whose success I dare not
==3==Make any timorous question; yet I wish him
==4==Excess and overflow of power, and’t might be,
==5==To dure ill-dealing fortune. Speed to him,
==6==Store never hurts good governors.

**PIR.**
==6==                  Though I know
==7==His ocean needs not my poor drops, yet they
==8==Must yield their tribute there. My precious maid,
==9==Those best affections that the heavens infuse
==10==In their best-temper’d pieces, keep enthron’d
==11==In your dear heart!

**EMIL.**
==11==           Thanks, sir. Remember me
==12==To our all-royal brother, for whose speed
==13==The great Bellona I’ll solicit; and
==14==Since in our terrene state petitions are not
==15==Without gifts understood, I’ll offer to her
==16==What I shall be advis’d she likes. Our hearts
==17==Are in his army, in his tent.

**HIP.**
==17==                In ’s bosom.
==18==We have been soldiers, and we cannot weep
==19==When our friends don their helms, or put to sea,
==20==Or tell of babes broach’d on the lance, or women
==21==That have sod their infants in (and after eat them) 
==22==The brine they wept at killing ’em. Then if
==23==You stay to see of us such spinsters, we
==24==Should hold you here forever.

**PIR.**
==24==                  Peace be to you
==25==As I pursue this war, which shall be then
==26==Beyond further requiring.

*Exit Pirithous.*

**EMIL.**
==26==              How his longing
==27==Follows his friend: since his depart, his sports,
==28==Though craving seriousness and skill, pass’d slightly
==29==His careless execution, where nor gain
==30==Made him regard, or loss consider, but
==31==Playing o’er business in his hand, another
==32==Directing in his head, his mind nurse equal
==33==To these so diff’ring twins. Have you observ’d him
==34==Since our great lord departed?

**HIP.**
==34==                With much labor;
==35==And I did love him for’t. They two have cabin’d
==36==In many as dangerous as poor a corner,
==37==Peril and want contending, they have skiff’d
==38==Torrents whose roaring tyranny and power
==39==I’ th’ least of these was dreadful, and they have
==40==Fought out together where death’s self was lodg’d;
==41==Yet fate hath brought them off. Their knot of love
==42==Tied, weav’d, entangled, with so true, so long,
==43==And with a finger of so deep a cunning,
==44==May be outworn, never undone. I think
==45==Theseus cannot be umpire to himself,
==46==Cleaving his conscience into twain and doing
==47==Each side like justice, which he loves best.

**EMIL.**
==47==                       Doubtless
==48==There is a best, and reason has no manners
==49==To say it is not you. I was acquainted
==50==Once with a time when I enjoy’d a playfellow;
==51==You were at wars when she the grave enrich’d,
==52==Who made too proud the bed, took leave o’ th’ moon
==53==(Which then look’d pale at parting) when our count
==54==Was each eleven.

**HIP.**
==54==           ’Twas Flavina.

**EMIL.**
==54==                       Yes.
==55==You talk of Pirithous’ and Theseus’ love:
==56==Theirs has more ground, is more maturely season’d,
==57==More buckled with strong judgment, and their needs
==58==The one of th’ other may be said to water
==59==Their intertangled roots of love, but I
==60==And she (I sigh and spoke of) were things innocent,
==61==Lov’d for we did, and like the elements
==62==That know not what nor why, yet do effect
==63==Rare issues by their operance, our souls
==64==Did so to one another. What she lik’d
==65==Was then of me approv’d, what not, condemn’d,
==66==No more arraignment. The flow’r that I would pluck
==67==And put between my breasts (O then but beginning
==68==To swell about the blossom), she would long
==69==Till she had such another, and commit it
==70==To the like innocent cradle, where phoenix-like
==71==They died in perfume. On my head no toy
==72==But was her pattern, her affections (pretty,
==73==Though happily her careless wear) I followed
==74==For my most serious decking. Had mine ear
==75==Stol’n some new air, or at adventure humm’d one
==76==From musical coinage, why, it was a note
==77==Whereon her spirits would sojourn (rather dwell on) 
==78==And sing it in her slumbers. This rehearsal
==79==(Which, ev’ry innocent wots well, comes in
==80==Like old importment’s bastard) has this end,
==81==That the true love ’tween maid and maid may be
==82==More than in sex dividual.

**HIP.**
==82==              Y’ are out of breath,
==83==And this high-speeded pace is but to say
==84==That you shall never (like the maid Flavina) 
==85==Love any that’s call’d man.

**EMIL.**
==85==              I am sure I shall not.

**HIP.**
==86==Now alack, weak sister,
==87==I must no more believe thee in this point
==88==(Though in’t I know thou dost believe thyself) 
==89==Than I will trust a sickly appetite,
==90==That loathes even as it longs. But sure, my sister,
==91==If I were ripe for your persuasion, you
==92==Have said enough to shake me from the arm
==93==Of the all-noble Theseus, for whose fortunes
==94==I will now in and kneel, with great assurance
==95==That we, more than his Pirithous, possess
==96==The high throne in his heart.

**EMIL.**
==96==                I am not
==97==Against your faith, yet I continue mine.

*Exeunt.*
