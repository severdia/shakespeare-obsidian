## Act 1, Scene 4
[[Act 1, Scene 3|← Act 1, Scene 3]] | [[Act 1, Scene 5|Act 1, Scene 5 →]]

*A field before Thebes.*

*Cornets. A battle struck within; then a retreat; flourish.*

*Then enter Theseus, victor, with his Lords.*

*The three Queens meet him and fall on their faces before him.*

**1. QUEEN.**
==1==To thee no star be dark.

**2. QUEEN.**
==1==              Both heaven and earth
==2==Friend thee forever.

**3. QUEEN.**
==2==           All the good that may
==3==Be wish’d upon thy head, I cry amen to’t.

**THE.**
==4==Th’ impartial gods, who from the mounted heavens
==5==View us their mortal herd, behold who err,
==6==And in their time chastise. Go and find out
==7==The bones of your dead lords, and honor them
==8==With treble ceremony; rather than a gap
==9==Should be in their dear rites, we would supply’t.
==10==But those we will depute which shall invest
==11==You in your dignities, and even each thing
==12==Our haste does leave imperfect. So *adieu*,
==13==And heaven’s good eyes look on you!
*(Exeunt Queens.)*
*(Enter Herald with Attendants bearing Palamon and Arcite on two hearses.)*
==13==                     What are those?

**HER.**
==14==Men of great quality, as may be judg’d
==15==By their appointment. Some of Thebes have told’s
==16==They are sisters’ children, nephews to the King.

**THE.**
==17==By th’ helm of Mars, I saw them in the war,
==18==Like to a pair of lions smear’d with prey,
==19==Make lanes in troops aghast. I fix’d my note
==20==Constantly on them; for they were a mark
==21==Worth a god’s view. What was’t that prisoner told me
==22==When I inquired their names?

**HER.**
==22==                Wi’ leave, they’re called
==23==Arcite and Palamon.

**THE.**
==23==           ’Tis right—those, those.
==24==They are not dead?

**HER.**
==25==Nor in a state of life; had they been taken
==26==When their last hurts were given, ’twas possible
==27==They might have been recovered. Yet they breathe
==28==And have the name of men.

**THE.**
==28==              Then like men use ’em.
==29==The very lees of such (millions of rates) 
==30==Exceed the wine of others. All our surgeons
==31==Convent in their behoof, our richest balms,
==32==Rather than niggard, waste; their lives concern us
==33==Much more than Thebes is worth. Rather than have ’em
==34==Freed of this plight, and in their morning state
==35==(Sound and at liberty), I would ’em dead;
==36==But forty thousand fold we had rather have ’em
==37==Prisoners to us than death. Bear ’em speedily
==38==From our kind air, to them unkind, and minister
==39==What man to man may do; for our sake more,
==40==Since I have known frights, fury, friends’ behests,
==41==Love’s provocations, zeal, a mistress’ task,
==42==Desire of liberty, a fever, madness,
==43==Hath set a mark which nature could not reach to
==44==Without some imposition, sickness in will
==45==O’er-wrestling strength in reason. For our love,
==46==And great Apollo’s mercy, all our best
==47==Their best skill tender.—Lead into the city,
==48==Where having bound things scatter’d, we will post
==49==To Athens ’fore our army.

*Flourish. Exeunt, Attendants bearing Palamon and Arcite.*
