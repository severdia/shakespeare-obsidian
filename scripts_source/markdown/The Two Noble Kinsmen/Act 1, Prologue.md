**PRO.**
==1==New plays and maidenheads are near akin⁠—
==2==Much follow’d both, for both much money gi’n,
==3==If they stand sound and well; and a good play
==4==(Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage-day,
==5==And shake to lose his honor) is like her
==6==That after holy tie and first night’s stir,
==7==Yet still is modesty, and still retains
==8==More of the maid to sight than husband’s pains.
==9==We pray our play may be so; for I am sure
==10==It has a noble breeder and a pure,
==11==A learned, and a poet never went
==12==More famous yet ’twixt Po and silver Trent.
==13==Chaucer (of all admir’d) the story gives;
==14==There constant to eternity it lives.
==15==If we let fall the nobleness of this,
==16==And the first sound this child hear be a hiss,
==17==How will it shake the bones of that good man,
==18==And make him cry from under ground, “O, fan
==19==From me the witless chaff of such a writer
==20==That blasts my bays and my fam’d works makes lighter
==21==Than Robin Hood!” This is the fear we bring;
==22==For to say truth, it were an endless thing,
==23==And too ambitious, to aspire to him,
==24==Weak as we are, and almost breathless swim
==25==In this deep water. Do but you hold out
==26==Your helping hands, and we shall tack about
==27==And something do to save us. You shall hear
==28==Scenes, though below his art, may yet appear
==29==Worth two hours’ travail. To his bones sweet sleep!
==30==Content to you! If this play do not keep
==31==A little dull time from us, we perceive
==32==Our losses fall so thick we must needs leave.


*Flourish.*
