## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 6|← Act 2, Scene 6]] | [[Act 3, Scene 2|Act 3, Scene 2 →]]

*A forest near Athens.*

*Cornets in sundry places. Noise and hallowing, as people a-Maying.*

*Enter Arcite alone.*

**ARC.**
==1== The Duke has lost Hippolyta; each took
==2== A several land. This is a solemn rite
==3== They owe bloom’d May, and the Athenians pay it
==4== To th’ heart of ceremony. O queen Emilia,
==5== Fresher than May, sweeter
==6== Than her gold buttons on the boughs, or all
==7== Th’ enamell’d knacks o’ th’ mead or garden! Yea
==8== (We challenge too) the bank of any nymph,
==9== That makes the stream seem flowers! Thou, O jewel
==10== O’ th’ wood, o’ th’ world, hast likewise blest a place
==11== With thy sole presence. In thy rumination
==12== That I, poor man, might eftsoons come between
==13== And chop on some cold thought! Thrice-blessed chance,
==14== To drop on such a mistress, expectation
==15== Most guiltless on’t. Tell me, O Lady Fortune
==16== (Next after Emily my sovereign), how far
==17== I may be proud. She takes strong note of me,
==18== Hath made me near her; and this beauteous morn
==19== (The prim’st of all the year) presents me with
==20== A brace of horses; two such steeds might well
==21== Be by a pair of kings back’d, in a field
==22== That their crowns’ titles tried. Alas, alas,
==23== Poor cousin Palamon, poor prisoner, thou
==24== So little dream’st upon my fortune that
==25== Thou think’st thyself the happier thing to be
==26== So near Emilia. Me thou deem’st at Thebes,
==27== And therein wretched, although free. But if
==28== Thou knew’st my mistress breath’d on me, and that
==29== I ear’d her language, liv’d in her eye, O coz,
==30== What passion would enclose thee!

*Enter Palamon, as out of a bush, with his shackles; bends his fist at Arcite.*

**PAL.**
==30==                   Traitor kinsman,
==31== Thou shouldst perceive my passion, if these signs
==32== Of prisonment were off me, and this hand
==33== But owner of a sword! By all oaths in one,
==34== I, and the justice of my love, would make thee
==35== A confess’d traitor! O thou most perfidious
==36== That ever gently look’d! The void’st of honor
==37== That ev’r bore gentle token! Falsest cousin
==38== That ever blood made kin, call’st thou her thine?
==39== I’ll prove it in my shackles, with these hands
==40== Void of appointment, that thou li’st, and art
==41== A very thief in love, a chaffy lord,
==42== Nor worth the name of villain! Had I a sword,
==43== And these house-clogs away⁠—

**ARC.**
==43==                 Dear cousin Palamon⁠—

**PAL.**
==44== Cozener Arcite, give me language such
==45== As thou hast show’d me feat.

**ARC.**
==45==                 Not finding in
==46== The circuit of my breast any gross stuff
==47== To form me like your blazon, holds me to
==48== This gentleness of answer: ’tis your passion
==49== That thus mistakes, the which to you being enemy,
==50== Cannot to me be kind. Honor and honesty
==51== I cherish and depend on, howsoev’r
==52== You skip them in me, and with them, fair coz,
==53== I’ll maintain my proceedings. Pray be pleas’d
==54== To show in generous terms your griefs, since that
==55== Your question’s with your equal, who professes
==56== To clear his own way with the mind and sword
==57== Of a true gentleman.

**PAL.**
==57==            That thou durst, Arcite!

**ARC.**
==58== My coz, my coz, you have been well advertis’d
==59== How much I dare; y’ave seen me use my sword
==60== Against th’ advice of fear. Sure, of another
==61== You would not hear me doubted, but your silence
==62== Should break out, though i’ th’ sanctuary.

**PAL.**
==62==                          Sir,
==63== I have seen you move in such a place which well
==64== Might justify your manhood; you were call’d
==65== A good knight and a bold. But the whole week’s not fair
==66== If any day it rain. Their valiant temper
==67== Men lose when they incline to treachery,
==68== And then they fight like compell’d bears, would fly
==69== Were they not tied.

**ARC.**
==69==            Kinsman, you might as well
==70== Speak this and act it in your glass, as to
==71== His ear which now disdains you.

**PAL.**
==71==                   Come up to me,
==72== Quit me of these cold gyves, give me a sword
==73== Though it be rusty, and the charity
==74== Of one meal lend me; come before me then,
==75== A good sword in thy hand, and do but say
==76== That Emily is thine, I will forgive
==77== The trespass thou hast done me, yea, my life
==78== If then thou carry’t, and brave souls in shades
==79== That have died manly, which will seek of me
==80== Some news from earth, they shall get none but this⁠—
==81== That thou art brave and noble.

**ARC.**
==81==                 Be content,
==82== Again betake you to your hawthorn house.
==83== With counsel of the night, I will be here
==84== With wholesome viands; these impediments
==85== Will I file off; you shall have garments, and
==86== Perfumes to kill the smell o’ th’ prison; after,
==87== When you shall stretch yourself, and say but, “Arcite,
==88== I am in plight,” there shall be at your choice
==89== Both sword and armor.

**PAL.**
==89==               O you heavens, dares any
==90== So noble bear a guilty business? None
==91== But only Arcite; therefore none but Arcite
==92== In this kind is so bold.

**ARC.**
==92==               Sweet Palamon⁠—

**PAL.**
==93== I do embrace you and your offer. For
==94== Your offer do’t I only, sir; your person
==95== Without hypocrisy I may not wish
==96== More than my sword’s edge on’t.

*Wind horns off. Cornets.*

**ARC.**
==96==                   You hear the horns:
==97== Enter your musit, lest this match between ’s
==98== Be cross’d ere met. Give me your hand, farewell.
==99== I’ll bring you every needful thing. I pray you
==100== Take comfort and be strong.

**PAL.**
==100==                 Pray hold your promise;
==101== And do the deed with a bent brow. Most certain
==102== You love me not; be rough with me, and pour
==103== This oil out of your language. By this air,
==104== I could for each word give a cuff, my stomach
==105== Not reconcil’d by reason.

**ARC.**
==105==               Plainly spoken,
==106== Yet pardon me hard language. When I spur
==107== My horse, I chide him not; content and anger
==108== In me have but one face.
*(Wind horns within.)*
==108==               Hark, sir, they call
==109== The scatter’d to the banquet. You must guess
==110== I have an office there.

**PAL.**
==110==               Sir, your attendance
==111== Cannot please heaven, and I know your office
==112== Unjustly is achiev’d.

**ARC.**
==112==            If a good title,
==113== I am persuaded this question, sick between ’s,
==114== By bleeding must be cur’d. I am a suitor
==115== That to your sword you will bequeath this plea,
==116== And talk of it no more.

**PAL.**
==116==               But this one word:
==117== You are going now to gaze upon my mistress,
==118== For note you, mine she is⁠—

**ARC.**
==118==               Nay then⁠—

**PAL.**
==118==                      Nay, pray you⁠—
==119== You talk of feeding me to breed me strength;
==120== You are going now to look upon a sun
==121== That strengthens what it looks on; there you have
==122== A vantage o’er me, but enjoy’t till
==123== I may enforce my remedy. Farewell.

*Exeunt severally.*
