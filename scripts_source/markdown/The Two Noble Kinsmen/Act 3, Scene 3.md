## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Another part of the forest near Athens.*

*Enter Arcite with meat, wine, and files.*

**ARC.**
==1== I should be near the place. Ho, cousin Palamon!

*Enter Palamon.*

**PAL.**
==2== Arcite?

**ARC.**
==2==     The same. I have brought you food and files.
==3== Come forth and fear not, here’s no Theseus.

**PAL.**
==4== Nor none so honest, Arcite.

**ARC.**
==4==                 That’s no matter,
==5== We’ll argue that hereafter. Come, take courage,
==6== You shall not die thus beastly. Here, sir, drink⁠—
==7== I know you are faint—then I’ll talk further with you.

**PAL.**
==8== Arcite, thou mightst now poison me.

**ARC.**
==8==                      I might;
==9== But I must fear you first. Sit down, and good now
==10== No more of these vain parleys; let us not,
==11== Having our ancient reputation with us,
==12== Make talk for fools and cowards. To your health, etc.

*Drinks.*

**PAL.**
==13== Do.

**ARC.**
==13==     Pray sit down then, and let me entreat you
==14== By all the honesty and honor in you,
==15== No mention of this woman. ’Twill disturb us,
==16== We shall have time enough.

**PAL.**
==16==               Well, sir, I’ll pledge you.

*Drinks.*

**ARC.**
==17== Drink a good hearty draught, it breeds good blood, man.
==18== Do not you feel it thaw you?

**PAL.**
==18==                 Stay, I’ll tell you
==19== After a draught or two more.

**ARC.**
==19==                 Spare it not,
==20== The Duke has more, coz. Eat now.

**PAL.**
==20==                   Yes.

*Eats.*

**ARC.**
==20==                        I am glad
==21== You have so good a stomach.

**PAL.**
==21==                 I am gladder
==22== I have so good meat to’t.

**ARC.**
==22==               Is’t not mad lodging
==23== Here in the wild woods, cousin?

**PAL.**
==23==                   Yes, for them
==24== That have wild consciences.

**ARC.**
==24==                 How tastes your victuals?
==25== Your hunger needs no sauce, I see.

**PAL.**
==25==                   Not much.
==26== But if it did, yours is too tart, sweet cousin.
==27== What is this?

**ARC.**
==27==         Venison.

**PAL.**
==27==               ’Tis a lusty meat.
==28== Give me more wine. Here, Arcite, to the wenches
==29== We have known in our days! The Lord Steward’s daughter⁠—
==30== Do you remember her?

**ARC.**
==30==               After you, coz.

**PAL.**
==31== She lov’d a black-hair’d man.

**ARC.**
==31==                 She did so; well, sir?

**PAL.**
==32== And I have heard some call him Arcite, and⁠—

**ARC.**
==33== Out with’t, faith!

**PAL.**
==33==            She met him in an arbor:
==34== What did she there, coz? Play o’ th’ virginals?

**ARC.**
==35== Something she did, sir.

**PAL.**
==35==               Made her groan a month for’t;
==36== Or two, or three, or ten.

**ARC.**
==36==               The Marshal’s sister
==37== Had her share too, as I remember, cousin,
==38== Else there be tales abroad. You’ll pledge her?

**PAL.**
==38==                          Yes.

**ARC.**
==39== A pretty brown wench ’tis. There was a time
==40== When young men went a-hunting, and a wood,
==41== And a broad beech; and thereby hangs a tale.
==42== Heigh-ho!

**PAL.**
==42==     For Emily, upon my life! Fool,
==43== Away with this strain’d mirth! I say again,
==44== That sigh was breath’d for Emily. Base cousin,
==45== Dar’st thou break first?

**ARC.**
==45==               You are wide.

**PAL.**
==45==                      By heaven and earth,
==46== There’s nothing in thee honest.

**ARC.**
==46==                   Then I’ll leave you;
==47== You are a beast now.

**PAL.**
==47==            As thou mak’st me, traitor!

**ARC.**
==48== There’s all things needful, files and shirts and perfumes.
==49== I’ll come again some two hours hence and bring
==50== That that shall quiet all.

**PAL.**
==50==               A sword and armor.

**ARC.**
==51== Fear me not. You are now too foul; farewell.
==52== Get off your trinkets, you shall want nought.

**PAL.**
==52==                        Sirrah⁠—

**ARC.**
==53== I’ll hear no more.

*Exit.*

**PAL.**
==53==            If he keep touch, he dies for’t.

*Exit.*
