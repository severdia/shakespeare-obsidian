## Act 3, Scene 3
[[Act 3, Scene 2|← Act 3, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 4|Act 3, Scene 4 →]]

*Another part of the forest near Athens.*

*Enter Arcite with meat, wine, and files.*

**ARC.**
I should be near the place. Ho, cousin Palamon!

*Enter Palamon.*

**PAL.**
Arcite?

**ARC.**
    The same. I have brought you food and files.
Come forth and fear not, here’s no Theseus.

**PAL.**
Nor none so honest, Arcite.

**ARC.**
                That’s no matter,
We’ll argue that hereafter. Come, take courage,
You shall not die thus beastly. Here, sir, drink⁠—
I know you are faint—then I’ll talk further with you.

**PAL.**
Arcite, thou mightst now poison me.

**ARC.**
                     I might;
But I must fear you first. Sit down, and good now
No more of these vain parleys; let us not,
Having our ancient reputation with us,
Make talk for fools and cowards. To your health, etc.

*Drinks.*

**PAL.**
Do.

**ARC.**
    Pray sit down then, and let me entreat you
By all the honesty and honor in you,
No mention of this woman. ’Twill disturb us,
We shall have time enough.

**PAL.**
              Well, sir, I’ll pledge you.

*Drinks.*

**ARC.**
Drink a good hearty draught, it breeds good blood, man.
Do not you feel it thaw you?

**PAL.**
                Stay, I’ll tell you
After a draught or two more.

**ARC.**
                Spare it not,
The Duke has more, coz. Eat now.

**PAL.**
                  Yes.

*Eats.*

**ARC.**
                       I am glad
You have so good a stomach.

**PAL.**
                I am gladder
I have so good meat to’t.

**ARC.**
              Is’t not mad lodging
Here in the wild woods, cousin?

**PAL.**
                  Yes, for them
That have wild consciences.

**ARC.**
                How tastes your victuals?
Your hunger needs no sauce, I see.

**PAL.**
                  Not much.
But if it did, yours is too tart, sweet cousin.
What is this?

**ARC.**
        Venison.

**PAL.**
              ’Tis a lusty meat.
Give me more wine. Here, Arcite, to the wenches
We have known in our days! The Lord Steward’s daughter⁠—
Do you remember her?

**ARC.**
              After you, coz.

**PAL.**
She lov’d a black-hair’d man.

**ARC.**
                She did so; well, sir?

**PAL.**
And I have heard some call him Arcite, and⁠—

**ARC.**
Out with’t, faith!

**PAL.**
           She met him in an arbor:
What did she there, coz? Play o’ th’ virginals?

**ARC.**
Something she did, sir.

**PAL.**
              Made her groan a month for’t;
Or two, or three, or ten.

**ARC.**
              The Marshal’s sister
Had her share too, as I remember, cousin,
Else there be tales abroad. You’ll pledge her?

**PAL.**
                         Yes.

**ARC.**
A pretty brown wench ’tis. There was a time
When young men went a-hunting, and a wood,
And a broad beech; and thereby hangs a tale.
Heigh-ho!

**PAL.**
    For Emily, upon my life! Fool,
Away with this strain’d mirth! I say again,
That sigh was breath’d for Emily. Base cousin,
Dar’st thou break first?

**ARC.**
              You are wide.

**PAL.**
                     By heaven and earth,
There’s nothing in thee honest.

**ARC.**
                  Then I’ll leave you;
You are a beast now.

**PAL.**
           As thou mak’st me, traitor!

**ARC.**
There’s all things needful, files and shirts and perfumes.
I’ll come again some two hours hence and bring
That that shall quiet all.

**PAL.**
              A sword and armor.

**ARC.**
Fear me not. You are now too foul; farewell.
Get off your trinkets, you shall want nought.

**PAL.**
                       Sirrah⁠—

**ARC.**
I’ll hear no more.

*Exit.*

**PAL.**
           If he keep touch, he dies for’t.

*Exit.*
