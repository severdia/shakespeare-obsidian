## Act 5, Scene 4
[[Act 5, Scene 3|← Act 5, Scene 3]] | [[Epilogue|Epilogue →]]

*A place near the Lists. A block prepared.*

*A block ready. Enter Palamon and his Knights pinion’d, Jailer, Executioner, etc., Guard.*

**PAL.**
==1==There’s many a man alive that hath outliv’d
==2==The love o’ th’ people, yea, i’ th’ self-same state
==3==Stands many a father with his child. Some comfort
==4==We have by so considering: we expire,
==5==And not without men’s pity; to live still,
==6==Have their good wishes; we prevent
==7==The loathsome misery of age, beguile
==8==The gout and rheum, that in lag hours attend
==9==For grey approachers; we come towards the gods
==10==Young and unwapper’d, not halting under crimes
==11==Many and stale. That sure shall please the gods
==12==Sooner than such, to give us nectar with ’em,
==13==For we are more clear spirits. My dear kinsmen,
==14==Whose lives (for this poor comfort) are laid down,
==15==You have sold ’em too too cheap.

**1. KNIGHT.**
==15==                  What ending could be
==16==Of more content? O’er us the victors have
==17==Fortune, whose title is as momentary
==18==As to us death is certain. A grain of honor
==19==They not o’erweigh us.

**2. KNIGHT.**
==19==              Let us bid farewell;
==20==And with our patience anger tott’ring Fortune,
==21==Who at her certain’st reels.

**3. KNIGHT.**
==21==              Come! Who begins?

**PAL.**
==22==Ev’n he that led you to this banquet shall
==23==Taste to you all.
*(To the Jailer.)*
==23==        Ah ha, my friend, my friend,
==24==Your gentle daughter gave me freedom once;
==25==You’ll see’t done now forever. Pray how does she?
==26==I heard she was not well; her kind of ill
==27==Gave me some sorrow.

**JAIL.**
==27==              Sir, she’s well restor’d,
==28==And to be married shortly.

**PAL.**
==28==              By my short life,
==29==I am most glad on’t. ’Tis the latest thing
==30==I shall be glad of, prithee tell her so.
==31==Commend me to her, and to piece her portion
==32==Tender her this.

*Gives purse.*

**1. KNIGHT.**
==32==        Nay, let’s be offerers all.

**2. KNIGHT.**
==33==Is it a maid?

**PAL.**
==33==        Verily I think so,
==34==A right good creature, more to me deserving
==35==Than I can quite or speak of.

**ALL KNIGHTS.**
==35==                Commend us to her.

*They give their purses.*

**JAIL.**
==36==The gods requite you all, and make her thankful!

**PAL.**
==37==*Adieu*; and let my life be now as short
==38==As my leave-taking.

*Lies on the block.*

**3. KNIGHT.**
==38==           Lead, courageous cousin.

**BOTH 1. KNIGHT. AND 2. KNIGHT.**
==39==We’ll follow cheerfully.

*A great noise within crying “Run! Save! Hold!”*

*Enter in haste a Messenger.*

**2. MESS.**
==40==Hold, hold! O, hold, hold, hold!

*Enter Pirithous in haste.*

**PIR.**
==41==Hold ho! It is a cursed haste you made
==42==If you have done so quickly. Noble Palamon,
==43==The gods will show their glory in a life
==44==That thou art yet to lead.

**PAL.**
==44==              Can that be, when
==45==Venus I have said is false? How do things fare?

**PIR.**
==46==Arise, great sir, and give the tidings ear
*(Palamon rises.)*
==47==That are most dearly sweet and bitter.

**PAL.**
==47==                     What
==48==Hath wak’d us from our dream?

**PIR.**
==48==                  List then: your cousin,
==49==Mounted upon a steed that Emily
==50==Did first bestow on him—a black one, owing
==51==Not a hair-worth of white, which some will say
==52==Weakens his price, and many will not buy
==53==His goodness with this note; which superstition
==54==Here finds allowance—on this horse is Arcite
==55==Trotting the stones of Athens, which the calkins
==56==Did rather tell than trample; for the horse
==57==Would make his length a mile, if’t pleas’d his rider
==58==To put pride in him. As he thus went counting
==59==The flinty pavement, dancing as ’twere to th’ music
==60==His own hoofs made (for as they say from iron
==61==Came music’s origin), what envious flint,
==62==Cold as old Saturn, and like him possess’d
==63==With fire malevolent, darted a spark,
==64==Or what fierce sulfur else, to this end made,
==65==I comment not—the hot horse, hot as fire,
==66==Took toy at this, and fell to what disorder
==67==His power could give his will, bounds, comes on end,
==68==Forgets school-doing, being therein train’d,
==69==And of kind manage; pig-like he whines
==70==At the sharp rowel, which he frets at rather
==71==Than any jot obeys; seeks all foul means
==72==Of boist’rous and rough jad’ry, to disseat
==73==His lord that kept it bravely. When nought serv’d,
==74==When neither curb would crack, girth break, nor diff’ring plunges
==75==Disroot his rider whence he grew, but that
==76==He kept him ’tween his legs, on his hind hoofs
==77==On end he stands,
==78==That Arcite’s legs, being higher than his head,
==79==Seem’d with strange art to hang. His victor’s wreath
==80==Even then fell off his head; and presently
==81==Backward the jade comes o’er, and his full poise
==82==Becomes the rider’s load. Yet is he living,
==83==But such a vessel ’tis that floats but for
==84==The surge that next approaches. He much desires
==85==To have some speech with you. Lo he appears.

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Emilia, Arcite in a chair.*

**PAL.**
==86==O miserable end of our alliance!
==87==The gods are mighty, Arcite. If thy heart,
==88==Thy worthy, manly heart, be yet unbroken,
==89==Give me thy last words; I am Palamon,
==90==One that yet loves thee dying.

**ARC.**
==91==Take Emilia,
==92==And with her all the world’s joy. Reach thy hand;
==93==Farewell. I have told my last hour; I was false,
==94==Yet never treacherous. Forgive me, cousin.
==95==One kiss from fair Emilia.—’Tis done.
==96==Take her. I die.

*Dies.*

**PAL.**
==96==        Thy brave soul seek Elysium!

**EMIL.**
==97==I’ll close thine eyes, prince; blessed souls be with thee!
==98==Thou art a right good man, and while I live,
==99==This day I give to tears.

**PAL.**
==99==              And I to honor.

**THE.**
==100==In this place first you fought; ev’n very here
==101==I sund’red you. Acknowledge to the gods
==102==Our thanks that you are living.
==103==His part is play’d, and though it were too short,
==104==He did it well; your day is length’ned, and
==105==The blissful dew of heaven does arrouse you.
==106==The powerful Venus well hath grac’d her altar,
==107==And given you your love. Our master Mars
==108==Hath vouch’d his oracle, and to Arcite gave
==109==The grace of the contention So the deities
==110==Have show’d due justice.—Bear this hence.

*Arcite is carried out.*

**PAL.**
==110==                       O cousin,
==111==That we should things desire which do cost us
==112==The loss of our desire! That nought could buy
==113==Dear love but loss of dear love!

**THE.**
==113==                  Never fortune
==114==Did play a subtler game. The conquer’d triumphs,
==115==The victor has the loss; yet in the passage
==116==The gods have been most equal. Palamon,
==117==Your kinsman hath confess’d the right o’ th’ lady
==118==Did lie in you, for you first saw her, and
==119==Even then proclaim’d your fancy. He restor’d her
==120==As your stol’n jewel, and desir’d your spirit
==121==To send him hence forgiven. The gods my justice
==122==Take from my hand, and they themselves become
==123==The executioners. Lead your lady off;
==124==And call your lovers from the stage of death,
==125==Whom I adopt my friends. A day or two
==126==Let us look sadly, and give grace unto
==127==The funeral of Arcite, in whose end
==128==The visages of bridegrooms we’ll put on
==129==And smile with Palamon; for whom an hour,
==130==But one hour since, I was as dearly sorry
==131==As glad of Arcite; and am now as glad
==132==As for him sorry. O you heavenly charmers,
==133==What things you make of us! For what we lack
==134==We laugh, for what we have are sorry, still
==135==Are children in some kind. Let us be thankful
==136==For that which is, and with you leave dispute
==137==That are above our question. Let’s go off,
==138==And bear us like the time.

*Flourish. Exeunt.*
