## Act 2, Scene 5
[[Act 2, Scene 4|← Act 2, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 6|Act 2, Scene 6 →]]

*Athens. An open place.*

*This short flourish of cornets, and shouts within. Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, Emilia, Arcite disguised, with a garland, etc.*

**THE.**
==1== You have done worthily. I have not seen,
==2== Since Hercules, a man of tougher sinews.
==3== What e’er you are, you run the best, and wrestle,
==4== That these times can allow.

**ARC.**
==4==               I am proud to please you.

**THE.**
==5== What country bred you?

**ARC.**
==5==               This; but far off, prince.

**THE.**
==6== Are you a gentleman?

**ARC.**
==6==            My father said so;
==7== And to those gentle uses gave me life.

**THE.**
==8== Are you his heir?

**ARC.**
==8==            His youngest, sir.

**THE.**
==8==                      Your father
==9== Sure is a happy sire then. What proves you?

**ARC.**
==10== A little of all noble qualities:
==11== I could have kept a hawk, and well have hollow’d
==12== To a deep cry of dogs; I dare not praise
==13== My feat in horsemanship, yet they that knew me
==14== Would say it was my best piece; last, and greatest,
==15== I would be thought a soldier.

**THE.**
==15==                 You are perfect.

**PIR.**
==16== Upon my soul, a proper man!

**EMIL.**
==16==                 He is so.

**PIR.**
==17== How do you like him, lady?

**HIP.**
==17==               I admire him;
==18== I have not seen so young a man so noble
==19== (If he say true) of his sort.

**EMIL.**
==19==               Believe
==20== His mother was a wondrous handsome woman,
==21== His face, methinks, goes that way.

**HIP.**
==21==                   But his body
==22== And fiery mind illustrate a brave father.

**PIR.**
==23== Mark how his virtue, like a hidden sun,
==24== Breaks through his baser garments.

**HIP.**
==24==                   He’s well got sure.

**THE.**
==25== What made you seek this place, sir?

**ARC.**
==25==                   Noble Theseus,
==26== To purchase name, and do my ablest service
==27== To such a well-found wonder as thy worth,
==28== For only in thy court, of all the world,
==29== Dwells fair-ey’d honor.

**PIR.**
==29==               All his words are worthy.

**THE.**
==30== Sir, we are much indebted to your travel,
==31== Nor shall you lose your wish. Pirithous,
==32== Dispose of this fair gentleman.

**PIR.**
==32==                 Thanks, Theseus.⁠—
==33== What e’er you are, y’ are mine, and I shall give you
==34== To a most noble service—to this lady,
==35== This bright young virgin. Pray observe her goodness.
==36== You have honor’d her fair birthday with your virtues,
==37== And as your due y’ are hers. Kiss her fair hand, sir.

**ARC.**
==38== Sir, y’ are a noble giver. Dearest beauty,
==39== Thus let me seal my vow’d faith.
*(Kisses Emilia’s hand.)*
==40== When your servant
==41== (Your most unworthy creature) but offends you,
==42== Command him die, he shall.

**EMIL.**
==42==                 That were too cruel.
==43== If you deserve well, sir, I shall soon see’t.
==44== Y’ are mine, and somewhat better than your rank I’ll use you.

**PIR.**
==45== I’ll see you furnish’d, and because you say
==46== You are a horseman, I must needs entreat you
==47== This afternoon to ride, but ’tis a rough one.

**ARC.**
==48== I like him better, prince, I shall not then
==49== Freeze in my saddle.

**THE.**
==49==            Sweet, you must be ready,
==50== And you, Emilia, and you, friend, and all,
==51== Tomorrow, by the sun, to do observance
==52== To flow’ry May, in Dian’s wood. Wait well, sir,
==53== Upon your mistress. Emily, I hope
==54== He shall not go afoot.

**EMIL.**
==54==               That were a shame, sir,
==55== While I have horses.—Take your choice, and what
==56== You want at any time, let me but know it.
==57== If you serve faithfully, I dare assure you
==58== You’ll find a loving mistress.

**ARC.**
==58==                 If I do not,
==59== Let me find that my father ever hated,
==60== Disgrace and blows.

**THE.**
==60==            Go lead the way; you have won it.
==61== It shall be so; you shall receive all dues
==62== Fit for the honor you have won; ’twere wrong else.
==63== Sister, beshrew my heart, you have a servant
==64== That if I were a woman, would be master,
==65== But you are wise.

**EMIL.**
==65==            I hope too wise for that, sir.

*Flourish. Exeunt omnes.*
