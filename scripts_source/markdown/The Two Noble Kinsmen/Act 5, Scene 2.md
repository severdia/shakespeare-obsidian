## Act 5, Scene 2
[[Act 5, Scene 1|← Act 5, Scene 1]] | [[Act 5, Scene 3|Act 5, Scene 3 →]]

*A darkened room in the prison.*

*Enter Doctor, Jailer, and Wooer in habit of Palamon.*

**DOCT.**
==1== Has this advice I told you done any good upon her?

**WOOER.**
==2== O, very much; the maids that kept her company
==3== Have half persuaded her that I am Palamon.
==4== Within this half hour she came smiling to me,
==5== And ask’d me what I would eat, and when I would kiss her.
==6== I told her, presently, and kiss’d her twice.

**DOCT.**
==7== ’Twas well done. Twenty times had been far better,
==8== For there the cure lies mainly.

**WOOER.**
==8==                 Then she told me
==9== She would watch with me tonight, for well she knew
==10== What hour my fit would take me.

**DOCT.**
==10==                   Let her do so,
==11== And when your fit comes, fit her home, and presently.

**WOOER.**
==12== She would have me sing.

**DOCT.**
==13== You did so?

**WOOER.**
==13==         No.

**DOCT.**
==13==            ’Twas very ill done then.
==14== You should observe her ev’ry way.

**WOOER.**
==14==                   Alas,
==15== I have no voice, sir, to confirm her that way.

**DOCT.**
==16== That’s all one, if ye make a noise.
==17== If she entreat again, do any thing,
==18== Lie with her, if she ask you.

**JAIL.**
==18==               Ho there, doctor!

**DOCT.**
==19== Yes, in the way of cure.

**JAIL.**
==19==               But first, by your leave,
==20== I’ th’ way of honesty.

**DOCT.**
==20==            That’s but a niceness.
==21== Nev’r cast your child away for honesty.
==22== Cure her first this way; then if she will be honest,
==23== She has the path before her.

**JAIL.**
==23==                 Thank ye, doctor.

**DOCT.**
==24== Pray bring her in
==25== And let’s see how she is.

**JAIL.**
==25==               I will, and tell her
==26== Her Palamon stays for her; but, doctor,
==27== Methinks you are i’ th’ wrong still.

*Exit Jailer.*

**DOCT.**
==27==                   Go, go!
==28== You fathers are fine fools. Her honesty!
==29== And we should give her physic till we find that⁠—

**WOOER.**
==30== Why, do you think she is not honest, sir?

**DOCT.**
==31== How old is she?

**WOOER.**
==31==         She’s eighteen.

**DOCT.**
==31==                   She may be,
==32== But that’s all one, ’tis nothing to our purpose.
==33== What e’er her father says, if you perceive
==34== Her mood inclining that way that I spoke of,
==35== *Videlicet*, the way of flesh—you have me?

**WOOER.**
==36== Yet very well, sir.

**DOCT.**
==36==            Please her appetite,
==37== And do it home; it cures her *ipso facto*
==38== The melancholy humor that infects her.

**WOOER.**
==39== I am of your mind, doctor.

*Enter Jailer, Daughter, Maid.*

**DOCT.**
==40== You’ll find it so. She comes. Pray humor her.

*Wooer retires.*

**JAIL.**
==41== Come, your love Palamon stays for you, child,
==42== And has done this long hour, to visit you.

**DAUGH.**
==43== I thank him for his gentle patience,
==44== He’s a kind gentleman, and I am much bound to him.
==45== Did you nev’r see the horse he gave me?

**JAIL.**
==45==                          Yes.

**DAUGH.**
==46== How do you like him?

**JAIL.**
==46==               He’s a very fair one.

**DAUGH.**
==47== You never saw him dance?

**JAIL.**
==47==               No.

**DAUGH.**
==47==                   I have often.
==48== He dances very finely, very comely,
==49== And for a jig, come cut and long tail to him,
==50== He turns ye like a top.

**JAIL.**
==50==            That’s fine indeed.

**DAUGH.**
==51== He’ll dance the Morris twenty mile an hour,
==52== And that will founder the best hobby-horse
==53== (If I have any skill) in all the parish,
==54== And gallops to the tune of “Light a’ love.”
==55== What think you of this horse?

**JAIL.**
==55==                 Having these virtues,
==56== I think he might be brought to play at tennis.

**DAUGH.**
==57== Alas, that’s nothing.

**JAIL.**
==57==            Can he write and read too?

**DAUGH.**
==58== A very fair hand, and casts himself th’ accounts
==59== Of all his hay and provender. That hostler
==60== Must rise betime that cozens him. You know
==61== The chestnut mare the Duke has?

**JAIL.**
==61==                   Very well.

**DAUGH.**
==62== She is horribly in love with him, poor beast,
==63== But he is like his master, coy and scornful.

**JAIL.**
==64== What dowry has she?

**DAUGH.**
==64==            Some two hundred bottles,
==65== And twenty strike of oats, but he’ll ne’er have her.
==66== He lisps in ’s neighing able to entice
==67== A miller’s mare, he’ll be the death of her.

**DOCT.**
==68== What stuff she utters!

**JAIL.**
==69== Make curtsy, here your love comes.

*Wooer comes forward.*

**WOOER.**
==69==                      Pretty soul,
==70== How do ye? That’s a fine maid! There’s a curtsy!

**DAUGH.**
==71== Yours to command i’ th’ way of honesty.
==72== How far is’t now to th’ end o’ th’ world, my masters?

**DOCT.**
==73== Why, a day’s journey, wench.

**DAUGH.**
==73==                 Will you go with me?

**WOOER.**
==74== What shall we do there, wench?

**DAUGH.**
==74==                 Why, play at stoolball:
==75== What is there else to do?

**WOOER.**
==75==               I am content,
==76== If we shall keep our wedding there.

**DAUGH.**
==76==                   ’Tis true,
==77== For there, I will assure you, we shall find
==78== Some blind priest for the purpose that will venture
==79== To marry us, for here they are nice and foolish.
==80== Besides, my father must be hang’d tomorrow,
==81== And that would be a blot i’ th’ business.
==82== Are not you Palamon?

**WOOER.**
==82==               Do not you know me?

**DAUGH.**
==83== Yes, but you care not for me. I have nothing
==84== But this poor petticoat and two coarse smocks.

**WOOER.**
==85== That’s all one, I will have you.

**DAUGH.**
==85==                   Will you surely?

**WOOER.**
==86== Yes, by this fair hand, will I.

**DAUGH.**
==86==                 We’ll to bed then.

**WOOER.**
==87== Ev’n when you will.

*Kisses her.*

**DAUGH.**
==87==            O, sir, you would fain be nibbling.

**WOOER.**
==88== Why do you rub my kiss off?

**DAUGH.**
==88==                 ’Tis a sweet one,
==89== And will perfume me finely against the wedding.
==90== Is not this your cousin Arcite?

**DOCT.**
==90==                 Yes, sweet heart,
==91== And I am glad my cousin Palamon
==92== Has made so fair a choice.

**DAUGH.**
==92==               Do you think he’ll have me?

**DOCT.**
==93== Yes, without doubt.

**DAUGH.**
==93==            Do you think so too?

**JAIL.**
==93==                          Yes.

**DAUGH.**
==94== We shall have many children.—Lord, how y’ are grown!
==95== My Palamon I hope will grow too, finely,
==96== Now he’s at liberty. Alas, poor chicken,
==97== He was kept down with hard meat and ill lodging,
==98== But I’ll kiss him up again.

*Enter First Messenger.*

**1. MESS.**
==99== What do you here? You’ll lose the noblest sight
==100== That ev’r was seen.

**JAIL.**
==100==            Are they i’ th’ field?

**1. MESS.**
==100==                        They are.
==101== You bear a charge there too.

**JAIL.**
==101==                 I’ll away straight.
==102== I must ev’n leave you here.

**DOCT.**
==102==               Nay, we’ll go with you,
==103== I will not lose the fight.

**JAIL.**
==103==               How did you like her?

**DOCT.**
==104== I’ll warrant you within these three or four days
==105== I’ll make her right again.
*(To the Wooer.)*
==105==               You must not from her,
==106== But still preserve her in this way.

**WOOER.**
==106==                   I will.

**DOCT.**
==107== Let’s get her in.

**WOOER.**
==107==         Come, sweet, we’ll go to dinner,
==108== And then we’ll play at cards.

**DAUGH.**
==108==                 And shall we kiss too?

**WOOER.**
==109== A hundred times.

**DAUGH.**
==109==            And twenty?

**WOOER.**
==109==                   Ay, and twenty.

**DAUGH.**
==110== And then we’ll sleep together?

**DOCT.**
==110==                 Take her offer.

**WOOER.**
==111== Yes, marry, will we.

**DAUGH.**
==111==            But you shall not hurt me.

**WOOER.**
==112== I will not, sweet.

**DAUGH.**
==112==            If you do, love, I’ll cry.

*Exeunt.*
