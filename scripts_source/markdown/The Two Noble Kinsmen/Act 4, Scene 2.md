## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*A room in the palace.*

*Enter Emilia alone, with two pictures.*

**EMIL.**
==1==Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open
==2==And bleed to death for my sake else. I’ll choose,
==3==And end their strife. Two such young handsome men
==4==Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,
==5==Following the dead-cold ashes of their sons,
==6==Shall never curse my cruelty. Good heaven,
==7==What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,
==8==With all her best endowments, all those beauties
==9==She sows into the births of noble bodies,
==10==Were here a mortal woman, and had in her
==11==The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless
==12==She would run mad for this man. What an eye,
==13==Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,
==14==Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling.
==15==Just such another wanton Ganymede
==16==Set Jove afire with, and enforc’d the god
==17==Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,
==18==A shining constellation. What a brow,
==19==Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,
==20==Arch’d like the great-ey’d Juno’s, but far sweeter,
==21==Smoother than Pelops’ shoulder! Fame and Honor
==22==Methinks from hence, as from a promontory
==23==Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing
==24==To all the under world the loves and fights
==25==Of gods and such men near ’em. Palamon
==26==Is but his foil, to him, a mere dull shadow;
==27==He’s swarth and meager, of an eye as heavy
==28==As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,
==29==No stirring in him, no alacrity,
==30==Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.
==31==Yet these that we count errors may become him:
==32==Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.
==33==O, who can find the bent of woman’s fancy?
==34==I am a fool, my reason is lost in me;
==35==I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly
==36==That women ought to beat me. On my knees
==37==I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone
==38==And only beautiful, and these the eyes,
==39==These the bright lamps of beauty, that command
==40==And threaten Love, and what young maid dare cross ’em?
==41==What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,
==42==Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only
==43==From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite,
==44==Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,
==45==And this the noble body. I am sotted,
==46==Utterly lost. My virgin’s faith has fled me;
==47==For if my brother but even now had ask’d me
==48==Whether I lov’d, I had run mad for Arcite;
==49==Now if my sister—more for Palamon.
==50==Stand both together: now, come ask me, brother⁠—
==51==Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister⁠—
==52==I may go look! What a mere child is fancy,
==53==That having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,
==54==Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both!
*(Enter Gentleman.)*
==55==How now, sir?

**GENT.**
==55==        From the noble Duke your brother,
==56==Madam, I bring you news. The knights are come.

**EMIL.**
==57==To end the quarrel?

**GENT.**
==57==           Yes.

**EMIL.**
==57==              Would I might end first!
==58==What sins have I committed, chaste Diana,
==59==That my unspotted youth must now be soil’d
==60==With blood of princes? And my chastity
==61==Be made the altar where the lives of lovers⁠—
==62==Two greater and two better never yet
==63==Made mothers joy—must be the sacrifice
==64==To my unhappy beauty?

*Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, Pirithous, and Attendants.*

**THE.**
==64==              Bring ’em in
==65==Quickly, by any means, I long to see ’em.⁠—
==66==Your two contending lovers are return’d,
==67==And with them their fair knights. Now, my fair sister,
==68==You must love one of them.

**EMIL.**
==68==                I had rather both,
==69==So neither for my sake should fall untimely.

**THE.**
==70==Who saw ’em?

**PIR.**
==70==        I a while.

**GENT.**
==70==              And I.

*Enter First Messenger.*

**THE.**
==71==From whence come you, sir?

**1. MESS.**
==71==              From the knights.

**THE.**
==71==                         Pray speak,
==72==You that have seen them, what they are.

**1. MESS.**
==72==                       I will, sir,
==73==And truly what I think. Six braver spirits
==74==Than these they have brought (if we judge by the outside) 
==75==I never saw nor read of. He that stands
==76==In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming
==77==Should be a stout man, by his face a prince
==78==(His very looks so say him), his complexion
==79==Nearer a brown than black; stern, and yet noble,
==80==Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers.
==81==The circles of his eyes show fire within him,
==82==And as a heated lion, so he looks;
==83==His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining
==84==Like ravens’ wings; his shoulders broad and strong,
==85==Arm’d long and round, and on his thigh a sword
==86==Hung by a curious baldrick, when he frowns
==87==To seal his will with. Better, o’ my conscience,
==88==Was never soldier’s friend.

**THE.**
==89==Thou hast well describ’d him.

**PIR.**
==89==                Yet a great deal short,
==90==Methinks, of him that’s first with Palamon.

**THE.**
==91==Pray speak him, friend.

**PIR.**
==91==              I guess he is a prince too,
==92==And if it may be, greater; for his show
==93==Has all the ornament of honor in’t.
==94==He’s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,
==95==But of a face far sweeter; his complexion
==96==Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt
==97==Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter
==98==To make this cause his own. In ’s face appears
==99==All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,
==100==And when he’s angry, then a settled valor
==101==(Not tainted with extremes) runs through his body,
==102==And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot,
==103==He shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow,
==104==Hard-hair’d, and curl’d, thick twin’d like ivy-tods,
==105==Not to undo with thunder. In his face
==106==The livery of the warlike maid appears,
==107==Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blest him;
==108==And in his rolling eyes sits victory,
==109==As if she ever meant to crown his valor.
==110==His nose stands high, a character of honor;
==111==His red lips, after fights, are fit for ladies.

**EMIL.**
==112==Must these men die too?

**PIR.**
==112==              When he speaks, his tongue
==113==Sounds like a trumpet. All his lineaments
==114==Are as a man would wish ’em, strong and clean.
==115==He wears a well-steel’d axe, the staff of gold.
==116==His age some five and twenty.

**1. MESS.**
==116==                There’s another,
==117==A little man, but of a tough soul, seeming
==118==As great as any. Fairer promises
==119==In such a body yet I never look’d on.

**PIR.**
==120==O, he that’s freckle-fac’d?

**1. MESS.**
==120==              The same, my lord.
==121==Are they not sweet ones?

**PIR.**
==121==              Yes, they are well.

**1. MESS.**
==121==                         Methinks,
==122==Being so few and well dispos’d, they show
==123==Great and fine art in nature. He’s white-hair’d,
==124==Not wanton white, but such a manly color
==125==Next to an auburn; tough and nimble set,
==126==Which shows an active soul; his arms are brawny,
==127==Lin’d with strong sinews; to the shoulder-piece
==128==Gently they swell, like women new conceiv’d,
==129==Which speaks him prone to labor, never fainting
==130==Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted, still,
==131==But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-ey’d,
==132==Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp
==133==To spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,
==134==He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,
==135==Nor takes none. He’s round-fac’d, and when he smiles
==136==He shows a lover, when he frowns, a soldier.
==137==About his head he wears the winner’s oak,
==138==And in it stuck the favor of his lady.
==139==His age some six and thirty. In his hand
==140==He bears a charging-staff emboss’d with silver.

**THE.**
==141==Are they all thus?

**PIR.**
==141==           They are all the sons of honor.

**THE.**
==142==Now as I have a soul I long to see ’em.
==143==Lady, you shall see men fight now.

**HIP.**
==143==                  I wish it,
==144==But not the cause, my lord. They would show
==145==Bravely about the titles of two kingdoms.
==146==’Tis pity love should be so tyrannous.
==147==O my soft-hearted sister, what think you?
==148==Weep not, till they weep blood. Wench, it must be.

**THE.**
==149==You have steel’d ’em with your beauty.—Honor’d friend,
==150==To you I give the field; pray order it,
==151==Fitting the persons that must use it.

**PIR.**
==151==                     Yes, sir.

**THE.**
==152==Come, I’ll go visit ’em. I cannot stay⁠—
==153==Their fame has fir’d me so—till they appear.
==154==Good friend, be royal.

**PIR.**
==154==           There shall want no bravery.

**EMIL.**
==155==Poor wench, go weep, for whosoever wins
==156==Loses a noble cousin for thy sins.

*Exeunt.*
