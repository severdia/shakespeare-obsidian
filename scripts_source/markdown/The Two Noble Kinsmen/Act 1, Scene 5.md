## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of a field before Thebes.*

*Music. Enter the Queens with the hearses of their Knights in a funeral solemnity, etc.*

**ALL QUEENS.**
*(Song.)*
==1== *Urns and odors bring away,*
==2== *Vapors, sighs, darken the day;*
==3== *Our dole more deadly looks than dying;*
==4== *Balms, and gums, and heavy cheers,*
==5== *Sacred vials fill’d with tears,*
==6== *And clamors through the wild air flying!*
==7== *Come all sad and solemn shows,*
==8== *That are quick-ey’d pleasure’s foes!*
==9== *We convent nought else but woes:*
==10== *We convent, etc.*

**3. QUEEN.**
==11== This funeral path brings to your household’s grave:
==12== Joy seize on you again! Peace sleep with him!

**2. QUEEN.**
==13== And this to yours.

**1. QUEEN.**
==13==            Yours this way. Heavens lend
==14== A thousand differing ways to one sure end.

**3. QUEEN.**
==15== This world’s a city full of straying streets,
==16== And death’s the market-place, where each one meets.

*Exeunt severally.*
