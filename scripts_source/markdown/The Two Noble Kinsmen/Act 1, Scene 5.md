## Act 1, Scene 5
[[Act 1, Scene 4|← Act 1, Scene 4]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*Another part of a field before Thebes.*

*Music. Enter the Queens with the hearses of their Knights in a funeral solemnity, etc.*

**ALL QUEENS.**
*(Song.)*
*Urns and odors bring away,*
*Vapors, sighs, darken the day;*
*Our dole more deadly looks than dying;*
*Balms, and gums, and heavy cheers,*
*Sacred vials fill’d with tears,*
*And clamors through the wild air flying!*
*Come all sad and solemn shows,*
*That are quick-ey’d pleasure’s foes!*
*We convent nought else but woes:*
*We convent, etc.*

**3. QUEEN.**
This funeral path brings to your household’s grave:
Joy seize on you again! Peace sleep with him!

**2. QUEEN.**
And this to yours.

**1. QUEEN.**
           Yours this way. Heavens lend
A thousand differing ways to one sure end.

**3. QUEEN.**
This world’s a city full of straying streets,
And death’s the market-place, where each one meets.

*Exeunt severally.*
