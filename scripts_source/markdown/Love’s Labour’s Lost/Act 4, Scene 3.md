## Act 4, Scene 3
[[Act 4, Scene 2|← Act 4, Scene 2]] | [[Act 5, Scene 1|Act 5, Scene 1 →]]

*The King of Navarre’s park.*

*Enter Berowne with a paper in his hand, alone.*

**BER.**
==1==The King he is hunting the deer: I am coursing myself. They have pitch’d a toil: I am toiling in a pitch—pitch that defiles—defile! A foul word. Well, “set thee down, sorrow!” for so they say the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well prov’d, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as Ajax. It kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep: well prov’d again a’ my side! I will not love; if I do, hang me; i’faith, I will not. O but her eye—by this light, but for her eye, I would not love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By heaven, I do love, and it hath taught me to rhyme and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme, and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one a’ my sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one with a paper, God give him grace to groan!

*He stands aside, climbing into a tree.*

*The King ent’reth with a paper.*

**KING.**
==2==Ay me!

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==3==Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid, thou hast thump’d him with thy bird-bolt under the left pap. In faith, secrets!

**KING.**
*(Reads.)*
==4==*“So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not*
==5== *To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,*
==6==*As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote*
==7== *The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows;*
==8==*Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright*
==9== *Through the transparent bosom of the deep,*
==10==*As doth thy face through tears of mine give light.*
==11== *Thou shin’st in every tear that I do weep,*
==12==*No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;*
==13== *So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.*
==14==*Do but behold the tears that swell in me,*
==15== *And they thy glory through my grief will show.*
==16==*But do not love thyself, then thou wilt keep*
==17==*My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.*
==18==*O queen of queens, how far dost thou excel*
==19==*No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.”*
==20==How shall she know my griefs? I’ll drop the paper.
==21==Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
*(Enter Longaville with a paper. The King steps aside.)*
==22==What, Longaville, and reading! Listen, ear.

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==23==Now in thy likeness, one more fool appear!

**LONG.**
==24==Ay me, I am forsworn!

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==25==Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.

**KING.**
*(Aside.)*
==26==In love, I hope—sweet fellowship in shame.

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==27==One drunkard loves another of the name.

**LONG.**
==28==Am I the first that have been perjur’d so?

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==29==I could put thee in comfort: not by two that I know.
==30==Thou makest the triumphery, the corner-cap of society,
==31==The shape of love’s Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.

**LONG.**
==32==I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move.
==33==O sweet Maria, empress of my love,
==34==These numbers will I tear, and write in prose!

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==35==O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid’s hose:
==36==Disfigure not his shop.

**LONG.**
==36==           This same shall go.
*(He reads the sonnet.)*
==37==*“Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,*
==38== *’Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,*
==39==*Persuade my heart to this false perjury?*
==40== *Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.*
==41==*A woman I forswore, but I will prove,*
==42== *Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee.*
==43==*My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;*
==44== *Thy grace being gain’d cures all disgrace in me.*
==45==*Vows are but breath, and breath a vapor is;*
==46== *Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,*
==47==*Exhal’st this vapor-vow; in thee it is.*
==48== *If broken then, it is no fault of mine:*
==49==*If by me broke, what fool is not so wise*
==50==*To lose an oath to win a paradise?”*

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==51==This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
==52==A green goose a goddess; pure, pure idolatry.
==53==God amend us, God amend! We are much out a’ th’ way.

*Enter Dumaine with a paper.*

**LONG.**
==54==By whom shall I send this?—Company? Stay.

*Steps aside.*

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==55==“All hid, all hid,” an old infant play.
==56==Like a demigod here sit I in the sky,
==57==And wretched fools’ secrets heedfully o’er-eye.
==58==More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
==59==Dumaine transformed! Four woodcocks in a dish!

**DUM.**
==60==O most divine Kate!

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==61==O most profane coxcomb!

**DUM.**
==62==By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==63==By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.

**DUM.**
==64==Her amber hairs for foul hath amber coted.

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==65==An amber-color’d raven was well noted.

**DUM.**
==66==As upright as the cedar.

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==66==              Stoop, I say,
==67==Her shoulder is with child.

**DUM.**
==67==              As fair as day.

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==68==Ay, as some days, but then no sun must shine.

**DUM.**
==69==O that I had my wish!

**LONG.**
*(Aside.)*
==69==           And I had mine!

**KING.**
*(Aside.)*
==70==And mine too, good Lord!

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==71==Amen, so I had mine. Is not that a good word?

**DUM.**
==72==I would forget her, but a fever she
==73==Reigns in my blood, and will rememb’red be.

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==74==A fever in your blood! Why then incision
==75==Would let her out in saucers. Sweet misprision!

**DUM.**
==76==Once more I’ll read the ode that I have writ.

**BER.**
*(Aside.)*
==77==Once more I’ll mark how love can vary wit.

**DUM.**
*(Reads his sonnet.)*
==78==*“On a day—alack the day!—*
==79==*Love, whose month is ever May,*
==80==*Spied a blossom passing fair*
==81==*Playing in the wanton air:*
==82==*Through the velvet leaves the wind,*
==83==*All unseen, can passage find;*
==84==*That the lover, sick to death,*
==85==*Wish’d himself the heavens’ breath.*
==86==*Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;*
==87==*Air, would I might triumph so!*
==88==*But, alack, my hand is sworn*
==89==*ne’er to pluck thee from thy thorn;*
==90==*Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,*
==91==*Youth so apt to pluck a sweet.*
==92==*Do not call it sin in me,*
==93==*That I am forsworn for thee;*
==94==*Thou for whom Jove would swear*
==95==*Juno but an Ethiop were,*
==96==*And deny himself for Jove,*
==97==*Turning mortal for thy love.”*
==98==This will I send and something else more plain
==99==That shall express my true love’s fasting pain.
==100==O would the King, Berowne, and Longaville
==101==Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
==102==Would from my forehead wipe a perjur’d note:
==103==For none offend where all alike do dote.

**LONG.**
*(Advancing.)*
==104==Dumaine, thy love is far from charity,
==105==That in love’s grief desir’st society:
==106==You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
==107==To be o’erheard and taken napping so.

**KING.**
*(Advancing.)*
==108==Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
==109==You chide at him, offending twice as much.
==110==You do not love Maria? Longaville
==111==Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
==112==Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
==113==His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
==114==I have been closely shrouded in this bush
==115==And mark’d you both, and for you both did blush.
==116==I heard your guilty rhymes, observ’d your fashion,
==117==Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion.
==118==“Ay me!” says one, “O Jove!” the other cries;
==119==One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other’s eyes.
*(To Longaville.)*
==120==You would for paradise break faith and troth,
*(To Dumaine.)*
==121==And Jove for your love would infringe an oath.
==122==What will Berowne say when that he shall hear
==123==Faith infringed, which such zeal did swear?
==124==How will he scorn! How will he spend his wit!
==125==How will he triumph, leap, and laugh at it!
==126==For all the wealth that ever I did see,
==127==I would not have him know so much by me.

**BER.**
==128==Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
*(Descending and advancing.)*
==129==Ah, good my liege, I pray thee pardon me!
==130==Good heart, what grace hast thou thus to reprove
==131==These worms for loving, that art most in love?
==132==Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
==133==There is no certain princess that appears;
==134==You’ll not be perjur’d, ’tis a hateful thing;
==135==Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
==136==But are you not asham’d? Nay, are you not,
==137==All three of you, to be thus much o’ershot?
==138==You found his mote, the King your mote did see;
==139==But I a beam do find in each of three.
==140==O, what a scene of fool’ry have I seen,
==141==Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow, and of teen!
==142==O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
==143==To see a king transformed to a gnat!
==144==To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
==145==And profound Salomon to tune a jig,
==146==And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
==147==And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
==148==Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumaine?
==149==And, gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
==150==And where my liege’s? All about the breast!
==151==A caudle ho!

**KING.**
==151==        Too bitter is thy jest.
==152==Are we betrayed thus to thy over-view?

**BER.**
==153==Not you by me, but I betrayed to you:
==154==I that am honest, I that hold it sin
==155==To break the vow I am engaged in.
==156==I am betrayed by keeping company
==157==With men like you, men of inconstancy.
==158==When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme,
==159==Or groan for Joan, or spend a minute’s time
==160==In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
==161==Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
==162==A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
==163==A leg, a limb⁠—

**KING.**
==163==        Soft, whither away so fast?
==164==A true man, or a thief, that gallops so?

**BER.**
==165==I post from love; good lover, let me go.

*Enter Jaquenetta and Clown Costard.*

**JAQ.**
==166==God bless the King!

**KING.**
==166==           What present hast thou there?

**COST.**
==167==Some certain treason.

**KING.**
==167==           What makes treason here?

**COST.**
==168==Nay, it makes nothing, sir.

**KING.**
==168==              If it mar nothing neither,
==169==The treason and you go in peace away together.

**JAQ.**
==170==I beseech your Grace let this letter be read:
==171==Our person misdoubts it; ’twas treason, he said.

**KING.**
==172==Berowne, read it over.
*(Berowne reads the letter.)*
==172==           Where hadst thou it?

**JAQ.**
==173==Of Costard.

**KING.**
==173==        Where hadst thou it?

**COST.**
==174==Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.

*Berowne tears the letter.*

**KING.**
==175==How now, what is in you? Why dost thou tear it?

**BER.**
==176==A toy, my liege, a toy; your Grace needs not fear it.

**LONG.**
==177==It did move him to passion, and therefore let’s hear it.

**DUM.**
*(Gathering up the pieces.)*
==178==It is Berowne’s writing, and here is his name.

**BER.**
*(To Costard.)*
==179==Ah, you whoreson loggerhead, you were born to do me shame.
==180==Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.

**KING.**
==181==What?

**BER.**
==182==That you three fools lack’d me fool to make up the mess.
==183==He, he, and you—and you, my liege!—and I,
==184==Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
==185==O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.

**DUM.**
==186==Now the number is even.

**BER.**
==186==              True, true, we are four.
==187==Will these turtles be gone?

**KING.**
==187==              Hence, sirs, away!

**COST.**
==188==Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.

*Exeunt Costard and Jaquenetta.*

**BER.**
==189==Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
==190==As true we are as flesh and blood can be.
==191==The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
==192==Young blood doth not obey an old decree.
==193==We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
==194==Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.

**KING.**
==195==What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?

**BER.**
==196==Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
==197==That (like a rude and savage man of Inde),
==198==At the first op’ning of the gorgeous east,
==199==Bows not his vassal head, and strucken blind,
==200==Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
==201==What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
==202==Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
==203==That is not blinded by her majesty?

**KING.**
==204==What zeal, what fury, hath inspir’d thee now?
==205==My love (her mistress) is a gracious moon,
==206==She (an attending star) scarce seen a light.

**BER.**
==207==My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Berowne.
==208==O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
==209==Of all complexions the cull’d sovereignty
==210==Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek,
==211==Where several worthies make one dignity,
==212==Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
==213==Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues⁠—
==214==Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not.
==215==To things of sale a seller’s praise belongs:
==216==She passes praise, then praise too short doth blot.
==217==A wither’d hermit, fivescore winters worn,
==218==Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
==219==Beauty doth varnish age, as if new born,
==220==And gives the crutch the cradle’s infancy.
==221==O, ’tis the sun that maketh all things shine!

**KING.**
==222==By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.

**BER.**
==223==Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
==224==A wife of such wood were felicity.
==225==O, who can give an oath? Where is a book?
==226==That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
==227==If that she learn not of her eye to look:
==228==No face is fair that is not full so black.

**KING.**
==229==O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
==230==The hue of dungeons, and the school of night;
==231==And beauty’s crest becomes the heavens well.

**BER.**
==232==Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of
==233==O, if in black my lady’s brows be deck’d,
==234==It mourns that painting and usurping hair
==235==Should ravish doters with a false aspect:
==236==And therefore is she born to make black fair.
==237==Her favor turns the fashion of the days,
==238==For native blood is counted painting now;
==239==And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
==240==Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

**DUM.**
==241==To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.

**LONG.**
==242==And since her time are colliers counted bright.

**KING.**
==243==And Ethiops of their sweet complexion crack.

**DUM.**
==244==Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

**BER.**
==245==Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
==246==For fear their colors should be wash’d away.

**KING.**
==247==’Twere good yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
==248==I’ll find a fairer face not wash’d today.

**BER.**
==249==I’ll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.

**KING.**
==250==No devil will fright thee then so much as she.

**DUM.**
==251==I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.

**LONG.**
==252==Look, here’s thy love,
*(Showing his boot.)*
==252==           my foot and her face see.

**BER.**
==253==O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
==254==Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!

**DUM.**
==255==O vile! Then as she goes what upward lies
==256==The street should see as she walk’d overhead.

**KING.**
==257==But what of this, are we not all in love?

**BER.**
==258==O, nothing so sure, and thereby all forsworn.

**KING.**
==259==Then leave this chat, and, good Berowne, now prove
==260==Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.

**DUM.**
==261==Ay marry, there—some flattery for this evil.

**LONG.**
==262==O, some authority how to proceed;
==263==Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.

**DUM.**
==264==Some *salve* for perjury.

**BER.**
==264==              O, ’tis more than need.
==265==Have at you then, affection’s men-at-arms.
==266==Consider what you first did swear unto:
==267==To fast, to study, and to see no woman⁠—
==268==Flat treason ’gainst the kingly state of youth.
==269==Say, can you fast? Your stomachs are too young,
==270==And abstinence engenders maladies.
==271==(And where that you have vow’d to study, lords,
==272==In that each of you have forsworn his book,
==273==Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
==274==For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
==275==Have found the ground of study’s excellence
==276==Without the beauty of a woman’s face?
==277==From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:
==278==They are the ground, the books, the academes,
==279==From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.
==280==Why, universal plodding poisons up
==281==The nimble spirits in the arteries,
==282==As motion and long-during action tires
==283==The sinowy vigor of the traveler.
==284==Now for not looking on a woman’s face,
==285==You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,
==286==And study too, the causer of your vow.
==287==For where is any author in the world
==288==Teaches such beauty as a woman’s eye?
==289==Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,
==290==And where we are, our learning likewise is.
==291==Then when ourselves we see in ladies’ eyes,
==292==With ourselves,
==293==Do we not likewise see our learning there?) 
==294==O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
==295==And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
==296==For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
==297==In leaden contemplation have found out
==298==Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
==299==Of beauty’s tutors have enrich’d you with?
==300==Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
==301==And therefore, finding barren practicers,
==302==Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;
==303==But love, first learned in a lady’s eyes,
==304==Lives not alone immured in the brain,
==305==But with the motion of all elements,
==306==Courses as swift as thought in every power,
==307==And gives to every power a double power,
==308==Above their functions and their offices.
==309==It adds a precious seeing to the eye:
==310==A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.
==311==A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,
==312==When the suspicious head of theft is stopp’d.
==313==Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible
==314==Than are the tender horns of cockled snails.
==315==Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.
==316==For valor, is not Love a Hercules,
==317==Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
==318==Subtile as Sphinx, as sweet and musical
==319==As bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair.
==320==And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
==321==Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.
==322==Never durst poet touch a pen to write
==323==Until his ink were temp’red with Love’s sighs:
==324==O then his lines would ravish savage ears
==325==And plant in tyrants mild humility.
==326==From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:
==327==They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
==328==They are the books, the arts, the academes,
==329==That show, contain, and nourish all the world,
==330==Else none at all in aught proves excellent.
==331==Then fools you were these women to forswear,
==332==Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
==333==For wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,
==334==Or for love’s sake, a word that loves all men,
==335==Or for men’s sake, the authors of these women,
==336==Or women’s sake, by whom we men are men,
==337==Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
==338==Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
==339==It is religion to be thus forsworn:
==340==For charity itself fulfills the law,
==341==And who can sever love from charity?

**KING.**
==342==Saint Cupid, then! And, soldiers, to the field!

**BER.**
==343==Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
==344==Pell-mell, down with them! But be first advis’d,
==345==In conflict that you get the sun of them.

**LONG.**
==346==Now to plain-dealing, lay these glozes by:
==347==Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?

**KING.**
==348==And win them too; therefore let us devise
==349==Some entertainment for them in their tents.

**BER.**
==350==First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
==351==Then homeward every man attach the hand
==352==Of his fair mistress. In the afternoon
==353==We will with some strange pastime solace them,
==354==Such as the shortness of the time can shape,
==355==For revels, dances, masks, and merry hours
==356==Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

**KING.**
==357==Away, away, no time shall be omitted
==358==That will be time, and may by us be fitted.

**BER.**
==359==*Allons! Allons!*
==360==Sow’d cockle reap’d no corn,
==361==And justice always whirls in equal measure:
==362==Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
==363==If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

*Exeunt.*
