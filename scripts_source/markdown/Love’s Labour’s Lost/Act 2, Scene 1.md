## Act 2, Scene 1
[[Act 1, Scene 2|← Act 1, Scene 2]] | [[Act 3, Scene 1|Act 3, Scene 1 →]]

*The King of Navarre’s park.*

*Enter the Princess of France with three attending Ladies (Rosaline, Maria, Katherine) and three Lords, one named Boyet.*

**BOYET.**
==1== Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits;
==2== Consider who the King your father sends,
==3== To whom he sends, and what’s his embassy:
==4== Yourself, held precious in the world’s esteem,
==5== To parley with the sole inheritor
==6== Of all perfections that a man may owe,
==7== Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
==8== Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
==9== Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
==10== As Nature was in making graces dear,
==11== When she did starve the general world beside
==12== And prodigally gave them all to you.

**PRIN.**
==13== Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
==14== Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
==15== Beauty is bought by judgment of the eye,
==16== Not utt’red by base sale of chapmen’s tongues.
==17== I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
==18== Than you much willing to be counted wise
==19== In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
==20== But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
==21== You are not ignorant all-telling fame
==22== Doth noise abroad Navarre hath made a vow,
==23== Till painful study shall outwear three years,
==24== No woman may approach his silent court;
==25== Therefore to ’s seemeth it a needful course,
==26== Before we enter his forbidden gates,
==27== To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
==28== Bold of your worthiness, we single you
==29== As our best-moving fair solicitor.
==30== Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
==31== On serious business craving quick dispatch,
==32== Importunes personal conference with his Grace.
==33== Haste, signify so much, while we attend,
==34== Like humble-visag’d suitors, his high will.

**BOYET.**
==35== Proud of employment, willingly I go.

*Exit Boyet.*

**PRIN.**
==36== All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
==37== Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
==38== That are vow-fellows with this virtuous Duke?

**1. FR. LORD.**
==39== Lord Longaville is one.

**PRIN.**
==39==               Know you the man?

**MAR.**
==40== I know him, madam; at a marriage-feast,
==41== Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
==42== Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
==43== In Normandy, saw I this Longaville,
==44== A man of sovereign parts, peerless esteem’d,
==45== Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms;
==46== Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
==47== The only soil of his fair virtue’s gloss,
==48== If virtue’s gloss will stain with any soil,
==49== Is a sharp wit match’d with too blunt a will,
==50== Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
==51== It should none spare that come within his power.

**PRIN.**
==52== Some merry mocking lord belike, is’t so?

**MAR.**
==53== They say so most that most his humors know.

**PRIN.**
==54== Such short-liv’d wits do wither as they grow.
==55== Who are the rest?

**KATH.**
==56== The young Dumaine, a well-accomplish’d youth,
==57== Of all that virtue love for virtue loved;
==58== Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
==59== For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
==60== And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
==61== I saw him at the Duke Alanson’s once,
==62== And much too little of that good I saw
==63== Is my report to his great worthiness.

**ROS.**
==64== Another of these students at that time
==65== Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
==66== Berowne they call him, but a merrier man,
==67== Within the limit of becoming mirth,
==68== I never spent an hour’s talk withal.
==69== His eye begets occasion for his wit,
==70== For every object that the one doth catch
==71== The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
==72== Which his fair tongue, conceit’s expositor,
==73== Delivers in such apt and gracious words
==74== That aged ears play truant at his tales,
==75== And younger hearings are quite ravished,
==76== So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

**PRIN.**
==77== God bless my ladies! Are they all in love,
==78== That every one her own hath garnished
==79== With such bedecking ornaments of praise?

**1. FR. LORD.**
==80== Here comes Boyet.

*Enter Boyet.*

**PRIN.**
==80==            Now, what admittance, lord?

**BOYET.**
==81== Navarre had notice of your fair approach,
==82== And he and his competitors in oath
==83== Were all address’d to meet you, gentle lady,
==84== Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
==85== He rather means to lodge you in the field,
==86== Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
==87== Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
==88== To let you enter his unpeopled house.
*(Enter Ferdinand, King of Navarre, Longaville, Dumaine, and Berowne, and Attendants.)*
==89== Here comes Navarre.

*The ladies-in-waiting mask.*

**KING.**
==90== Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

**PRIN.**
==91== “Fair” I give you back again, and “welcome” I have not yet. The roof of this court is too high to be yours, and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.

**KING.**
==92== You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

**PRIN.**
==93== I will be welcome then—conduct me thither.

**KING.**
==94== Hear me, dear lady: I have sworn an oath.

**PRIN.**
==95== Our Lady help my lord! He’ll be forsworn.

**KING.**
==96== Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

**PRIN.**
==97== Why, will shall break it, will, and nothing else.

**KING.**
==98== Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

**PRIN.**
==99== Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
==100== Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
==101== I hear your Grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
==102== ’Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
==103== And sin to break it.
==104== But pardon me, I am too sudden bold;
==105== To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
==106== Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
==107== And suddenly resolve me in my suit.

*Giving a paper.*

**KING.**
==108== Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

**PRIN.**
==109== You will the sooner, that I were away,
==110== For you’ll prove perjur’d if you make me stay.

**BER.**
==111== Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

**ROS.**
==112== Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

**BER.**
==113== I know you did.

**ROS.**
==113==         How needless was it then
==114== To ask the question?

**BER.**
==114==            You must not be so quick.

**ROS.**
==115== ’Tis long of you that spur me with such questions.

**BER.**
==116== Your wit’s too hot, it speeds too fast, ’twill tire.

**ROS.**
==117== Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

**BER.**
==118== What time a’ day?

**ROS.**
==119== The hour that fools should ask.

**BER.**
==120== Now fair befall your mask!

**ROS.**
==121== Fair fall the face it covers!

**BER.**
==122== And send you many lovers!

**ROS.**
==123== Amen, so you be none.

**BER.**
==124== Nay then will I be gone.

**KING.**
==125== Madam, your father here doth intimate
==126== The payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
==127== Being but the one half of an entire sum
==128== Disbursed by my father in his wars.
==129== But say that he, or we, as neither have,
==130== Receiv’d that sum, yet there remains unpaid
==131== A hundred thousand more, in surety of the which
==132== One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
==133== Although not valued to the money’s worth.
==134== If then the King your father will restore
==135== But that one half which is unsatisfied,
==136== We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
==137== And hold fair friendship with his Majesty.
==138== But that, it seems, he little purposeth:
==139== For here he doth demand to have repaid
==140== A hundred thousand crowns, and not demands,
==141== On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
==142== To have his title live in Aquitaine;
==143== Which we much rather had depart withal,
==144== And have the money by our father lent,
==145== Than Aquitaine, so gelded as it is.
==146== Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
==147== From reason’s yielding, your fair self should make
==148== A yielding ’gainst some reason in my breast,
==149== And go well satisfied to France again.

**PRIN.**
==150== You do the King my father too much wrong,
==151== And wrong the reputation of your name,
==152== In so unseeming to confess receipt
==153== Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

**KING.**
==154== I do protest I never heard of it;
==155== And, if you prove it, I’ll repay it back,
==156== Or yield up Aquitaine.

**PRIN.**
==156==            We arrest your word.
==157== Boyet, you can produce acquittances
==158== For such a sum from special officers
==159== Of Charles his father.

**KING.**
==159==            Satisfy me so.

**BOYET.**
==160== So please your Grace, the packet is not come
==161== Where that and other specialties are bound:
==162== Tomorrow you shall have a sight of them.

**KING.**
==163== It shall suffice me; at which interview
==164== All liberal reason I will yield unto.
==165== Mean time receive such welcome at my hand
==166== As honor (without breach of honor) may
==167== Make tender of to thy true worthiness.
==168== You may not come, fair Princess, within my gates,
==169== But here without you shall be so receiv’d
==170== As you shall deem yourself lodg’d in my heart,
==171== Though so denied fair harbor in my house.
==172== Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell.
==173== Tomorrow shall we visit you again.

**PRIN.**
==174== Sweet health and fair desires consort your Grace!

**KING.**
==175== Thy own wish wish I thee in every place.

*Exit with Longaville, Dumaine, and Attendants.*

**BOYET.**
==176== Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.

**ROS.**
==177== Pray you, do my commendations—I would be glad to see it.

**BOYET.**
==178== I would you heard it groan.

**ROS.**
==179== Is the fool sick?

**BOYET.**
==180== Sick at the heart.

**ROS.**
==181== Alack, let it blood.

**BOYET.**
==182== Would that do it good?

**ROS.**
==183== My physic says ay.

**BOYET.**
==184== Will you prick’t with your eye?

**ROS.**
==185== No point, with my knife.

**BOYET.**
==186== Now God save thy life!

**ROS.**
==187== And yours from long living!

**BER.**
==188== I cannot stay thanksgiving.

*Exit.*

*Enter Dumaine.*

**DUM.**
==189== Sir, I pray you a word. What lady is that same?

**BOYET.**
==190== The heir of Alanson, Katherine her name.

**DUM.**
==191== A gallant lady. *Monsieur*, fare you well.

*Exit.*

*Enter Longaville.*

**LONG.**
==192== I beseech you a word. What is she in the white?

**BOYET.**
==193== A woman sometimes, and you saw her in the light.

**LONG.**
==194== Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

**BOYET.**
==195== She hath but one for herself, to desire that were a shame.

**LONG.**
==196== Pray you, sir, whose daughter?

**BOYET.**
==197== Her mother’s, I have heard.

**LONG.**
==198== God’s blessing on your beard!

**BOYET.**
==199== Good sir, be not offended,
==200== She is an heir of Falconbridge.

**LONG.**
==201== Nay, my choler is ended.
==202== She is a most sweet lady.

**BOYET.**
==203== Not unlike, sir, that may be.

*Exit Longaville.*

*Enter Berowne.*

**BER.**
==204== What’s her name in the cap?

**BOYET.**
==205== Rosaline, by good hap.

**BER.**
==206== Is she wedded or no?

**BOYET.**
==207== To her will, sir, or so.

**BER.**
==208== O, you are welcome, sir, *adieu*.

**BOYET.**
==209== Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

*Exit Berowne.*

**MAR.**
==210== That last is Berowne, the merry madcap lord.
==211== Not a word with him but a jest.

**BOYET.**
==211==                 And every jest but a word.

**PRIN.**
==212== It was well done of you to take him at his word.

**BOYET.**
==213== I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

**KATH.**
==214== Two hot sheeps, marry.

**BOYET.**
==214==            And wherefore not ships?
==215== No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

**KATH.**
==216== You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?

**BOYET.**
==217== So you grant pasture for me.

*Offering to kiss her.*

**KATH.**
==217==                 Not so, gentle beast.
==218== My lips are no common, though several they be.

**BOYET.**
==219== Belonging to whom?

**KATH.**
==219==            To my fortunes and me.

**PRIN.**
==220== Good wits will be jangling, but, gentles, agree:
==221== This civil war of wits were much better used
==222== On Navarre and his book-men, for here ’tis abused.

**BOYET.**
==223== If my observation (which very seldom lies),
==224== By the heart’s still rhetoric, disclosed with eyes,
==225== Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

**PRIN.**
==226== With what?

**BOYET.**
==227== With that which we lovers entitle “affected.”

**PRIN.**
==228== Your reason?

**BOYET.**
==229== Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
==230== To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
==231== His heart like an agot with your print impressed,
==232== Proud with his form, in his eye pride expressed;
==233== His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
==234== Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
==235== All senses to that sense did make their repair,
==236== To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
==237== Methought all his senses were lock’d in his eye,
==238== As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy,
==239== Who tend’ring their own worth from where they were glass’d,
==240== Did point you to buy them, along as you pass’d;
==241== His face’s own margent did quote such amazes
==242== That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
==243== I’ll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
==244== And you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

**PRIN.**
==245== Come to our pavilion—Boyet is dispos’d.

**BOYET.**
==246== But to speak that in words which his eye hath disclos’d.
==247== I only have made a mouth of his eye,
==248== By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

**MAR.**
==249== Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skillfully.

**KATH.**
==250== He is Cupid’s grandfather, and learns news of him.

**ROS.**
==251== Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.

**BOYET.**
==252== Do you hear, my mad wenches?

**MAR.**
==252==                   No.

**BOYET.**
==252==                      What then, do you see?

**MAR.**
==253== Ay, our way to be gone.

**BOYET.**
==253==               You are too hard for me.

*Exeunt omnes.*
