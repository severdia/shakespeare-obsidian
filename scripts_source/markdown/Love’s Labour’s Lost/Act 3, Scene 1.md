## Act 3, Scene 1
[[Act 2, Scene 1|← Act 2, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 1|Act 4, Scene 1 →]]

*The King of Navarre’s park.*

*Enter Braggart Armado and his Boy Moth.*

**ARM.**
==1==Warble, child, make passionate my sense of hearing.

**MOTH.**
*(Sings the song.)*
==2== *“Concolinel.”*

**ARM.**
==3==Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years, take this key, give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither. I must employ him in a letter to my love.

**MOTH.**
==4==Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?

**ARM.**
==5==How meanest thou? Brawling in French?

**MOTH.**
==6==No, my complete master, but to jig off a tune at the tongue’s end, canary to it with your feet, humor it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you swallow’d love with singing love, sometime through the nose, as if you snuff’d up love by smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o’er the shop of your eyes; with your arms cross’d on your thin-bellied doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away: these are complements, these are humors, these betray nice wenches that would be betray’d without these; and make them men of note—do you note?—men that most are affected to these.

**ARM.**
==7==How hast thou purchased this experience?

**MOTH.**
==8==By my penny of observation.

**ARM.**
==9==But O—but O⁠—

**MOTH.**
==10==“The hobby-horse is forgot.”

**ARM.**
==11==Call’st thou my love “hobby-horse”?

**MOTH.**
==12==No, master, the hobby-horse is but a colt,
*(Aside.)*
==13==and your love perhaps a hackney.⁠—
==14==But have you forgot your love?

**ARM.**
==15==Almost I had.

**MOTH.**
==16==Negligent student, learn her by heart.

**ARM.**
==17==By heart and in heart, boy.

**MOTH.**
==18==And out of heart, master; all those three I will prove.

**ARM.**
==19==What wilt thou prove?

**MOTH.**
==20==A man, if I live; and this, “by, in, and without,” upon the instant: by heart you love her, because your heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her, because your heart is in love with her; and out of heart you love her, being out of heart that you cannot enjoy her.

**ARM.**
==21==I am all these three.

**MOTH.**
==22==And three times as much more⁠—
*(Aside.)*
==23==and yet nothing at all.

**ARM.**
==24==Fetch hither the swain, he must carry me a letter.

**MOTH.**
==25==A message well sympathiz’d—a horse to be ambassador for an ass.

**ARM.**
==26==Ha, ha? What sayest thou?

**MOTH.**
==27==Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse, for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.

**ARM.**
==28==The way is but short, away!

**MOTH.**
==29==As swift as lead, sir.

**ARM.**
==30==The meaning, pretty ingenious?
==31==Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

**MOTH.**
==32==*Minime*, honest master, or rather, master, no.

**ARM.**
==33==I say lead is slow.

**MOTH.**
==33==           You are too swift, sir, to say so.
==34==Is that lead slow which is fir’d from a gun?

**ARM.**
==35==Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
==36==He reputes me a cannon, and the bullet, that’s he;
==37==I shoot thee at the swain.

**MOTH.**
==37==              Thump then, and I flee.

*Exit.*

**ARM.**
==38==A most acute juvenal, volable and free of grace!
==39==By thy favor, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
==40==Most rude melancholy, valor gives thee place.
==41==My herald is return’d.

*Enter Page Moth and Clown Costard.*

**MOTH.**
==42==A wonder, master! Here’s a costard broken in a shin.

**ARM.**
==43==Some enigma, some riddle—come, thy *l’envoi*—begin.

**COST.**
==44==No egma, no riddle, no *l’envoi*, no *salve* in the mail, sir. O sir, plantan, a plain plantan; no *l’envoi*, no *l’envoi*, no *salve*, sir, but a plantan!

**ARM.**
==45==By virtue thou enforcest laughter—thy silly thought, my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes me to ridiculous smiling—O, pardon me, my stars! Doth the inconsiderate take *salve* for *l’envoi*, and the word “*l’envoi*” for a *salve*?

**MOTH.**
==46==Do the wise think them other? Is not *l’envoi* a *salve*?

**ARM.**
==47==No, page, it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
==48==Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
==49==I will example it:
==50==*The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee*
==51==*Were still at odds, being but three.*
==52==There’s the moral. Now the *l’envoi*.

**MOTH.**
==53==I will add the *l’envoi*. Say the moral again.

**ARM.**
==54==*The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee*
==55==*Were still at odds, being but three.*

**MOTH.**
==56==*Until the goose came out of door,*
==57==*And stayed the odds by adding four.*
==58==Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with my *l’envoi*:
==59==*The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee*
==60==*Were still at odds, being but three.*

**ARM.**
==61==*Until the goose came out of door,*
==62==*Staying the odds by adding four.*

**MOTH.**
==63==A good *l’envoi*, ending in the goose; would you desire more?

**COST.**
==64==The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that’s flat.
==65==Sir, your pennyworth is good, and your goose be fat.
==66==To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
==67==Let me see: a fat l’envoi—ay, that’s a fat goose.

**ARM.**
==68==Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

**MOTH.**
==69==By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
==70==Then call’d you for the *l’envoi*.

**COST.**
==71==True, and I for a plantan; thus came your argument in;
==72==Then the boy’s fat *l’envoi*, the goose that you bought,
==73==And he ended the market.

**ARM.**
==74==But tell me, how was there a costard broken in a shin?

**MOTH.**
==75==I will tell you sensibly.

**COST.**
==76==Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth. I will speak that *l’envoi*:
==77==I, Costard, running out that was safely within,
==78==Fell over the threshold, and broke my shin.

**ARM.**
==79==We will talk no more of this matter.

**COST.**
==80==Till there be more matter in the shin.

**ARM.**
==81==Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.

**COST.**
==82==O, marry me to one Frances! I smell some *l’envoi*, some goose, in this.

**ARM.**
==83==By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty, enfreedoming thy person: thou wert immured, restrained, captivated, bound.

**COST.**
==84==True, true, and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.

**ARM.**
==85==I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance, and in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this: bear this significant
*(Giving a letter)*
==86==to the country maid Jaquenetta. There is remuneration, for the best ward of mine honor is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.

**MOTH.**
==87==Like the sequel, I. *Señor* Costard, *adieu*.

*Exit Armado, followed by Moth.*

**COST.**
==88==My sweet ounce of man’s flesh, my incony Jew!
==89==Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration! O, that’s the Latin word for three farthings: three farthings—remuneration. “What’s the price of this inkle?”—“One penny.”—“No, I’ll give you a remuneration”: why, it carries it. Remuneration: why, it is a fairer name than French crown! I will never buy and sell out of this word.

*Enter Berowne.*

**BER.**
==90==O, my good knave Costard, exceedingly well met!

**COST.**
==91==Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man buy for a remuneration?

**BER.**
==92==O, what is a remuneration?

**COST.**
==93==Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.

**BER.**
==94==O, why then three-farthing worth of silk.

**COST.**
==95==I thank your worship, God be wi’ you!

**BER.**
==96==O, stay, slave; I must employ thee.
==97==As thou wilt win my favor, good my knave,
==98==Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

**COST.**
==99==When would you have it done, sir?

**BER.**
==100==O, this afternoon.

**COST.**
==101==Well, I will do it, sir; fare you well.

**BER.**
==102==O, thou knowest not what it is.

**COST.**
==103==I shall know, sir, when I have done it.

**BER.**
==104==Why, villain, thou must know first.

**COST.**
==105==I will come to your worship tomorrow morning.

**BER.**
==106==It must be done this afternoon. Hark, slave, it is but this:
==107==The Princess comes to hunt here in the park,
==108==And in her train there is a gentle lady:
==109==When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
==110==And Rosaline they call her. Ask for her,
==111==And to her white hand see thou do commend
==112==This seal’d-up counsel. There’s thy guerdon; go.

**COST.**
==113==Garden, O sweet gardon! Better than remuneration, eleven-pence-farthing better; most sweet gardon! I will do it, sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!

*Exit.*

**BER.**
==114==O, and I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love’s whip,
==115==A very beadle to a humorous sigh,
==116==A critic, nay, a night-watch constable,
==117==A domineering pedant o’er the boy,
==118==Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
==119==This wimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy,
==120==This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid,
==121==Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
==122==Th’ anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
==123==Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
==124==Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
==125==Sole imperator and great general
==126==Of trotting paritors (O my little heart!),
==127==And I to be a corporal of his field,
==128==And wear his colors like a tumbler’s hoop!
==129==What! I love, I sue, I seek a wife⁠—
==130==A woman, that is like a German clock,
==131==Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
==132==And never going aright, being a watch,
==133==But being watch’d that it may still go right!
==134==Nay, to be perjur’d, which is worst of all;
==135==And among three to love the worst of all,
==136==A whitely wanton with a velvet brow,
==137==With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
==138==Ay, and, by heaven, one that will do the deed
==139==Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard.
==140==And I to sigh for her, to watch for her,
==141==To pray for her, go to! It is a plague
==142==That Cupid will impose for my neglect
==143==Of his almighty dreadful little might.
==144==Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue, groan:
==145==Some men must love my lady, and some Joan.

*Exit.*
