## Act 4, Scene 2
[[Act 4, Scene 1|← Act 4, Scene 1]] | [[Act 4, Scene 3|Act 4, Scene 3 →]]

*The King of Navarre’s park.*

*Enter Dull, Holofernes the Pedant, and Nathaniel from watching the hunt.*

**NATH.**
==1== Very reverent sport truly, and done in the testimony of a good conscience.

**HOL.**
==2== The deer was (as you know) *sanguis*, in blood, ripe as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in the ear of *caelo*, the sky, the welkin, the heaven, and anon falleth like a crab on the face of *terra*, the soil, the land, the earth.

**NATH.**
==3== Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithites are sweetly varied, like a scholar at the least; but, sir, I assure ye it was a buck of the first head.

**HOL.**
==4== Sir Nathaniel, *haud credo*.

**DULL.**
==5== ’Twas not a *haud credo*, ’twas a pricket.

**HOL.**
==6== Most barbarous intimation! Yet a kind of insinuation, as it were *in via*, in way, of explication; *facere*, as it were, replication, or rather *ostentare*, to show, as it were, his inclination, after his undressed, unpolished, uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather unlettered, or ratherest unconfirmed fashion, to insert again my haud credo for a deer.

**DULL.**
==7== I said the deer was not a *haud credo*, ’twas a pricket.

**HOL.**
==8== Twice sod simplicity, *bis coctus*!
==9== O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!

**NATH.**
==10== Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred in a book;
==11== He hath not eat paper, as it were; he hath not drunk ink; his intellect is not replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in the duller parts;
==12== And such barren plants are set before us, that we thankful should be⁠—
==13== Which we of taste and feeling are—for those parts that do fructify in us more than he.
==14== For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
==15== So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
==16== But *omne bene*, say I, being of an old father’s mind:
==17== Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.

**DULL.**
==18== You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
==19== What was a month old at Cain’s birth, that’s not five weeks old as yet?

**HOL.**
==20== Dictynna, goodman Dull, Dictynna, goodman Dull.

**DULL.**
==21== What is Dictynna?

**NATH.**
==22== A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.

**HOL.**
==23== The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
==24== And raught not to five weeks when he came to five-score.
==25== Th’ allusion holds in the exchange.

**DULL.**
==26== ’Tis true indeed, the collusion holds in the exchange.

**HOL.**
==27== God comfort thy capacity! I say, th’ allusion holds in the exchange.

**DULL.**
==28== And I say, the pollution holds in the exchange, for the moon is never but a month old; and I say beside that, ’twas a pricket that the Princess kill’d.

**HOL.**
==29== Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph on the death of the deer? And to humor the ignorant, call I the deer the Princess kill’d a pricket.

**NATH.**
==30== *Perge*, good Master Holofernes, *perge*, so it shall please you to abrogate squirility.

**HOL.**
==31== I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
==32== The preyful Princess pierc’d and prick’d a pretty pleasing pricket;
==33== Some say a sore, but not a sore, till now made sore with shooting.
==34== The dogs did yell: put l to sore, then sorel jumps from thicket,
==35== Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
==36== If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores o’ sorel:
==37== Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.

**NATH.**
==38== A rare talent!

**DULL.**
*(Aside.)*
==39== If a talent be a claw, look how he claws him with a talent.

**HOL.**
==40== This is a gift that I have, simple; simple, a foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures, shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions, revolutions. These are begot in the ventricle of memory, nourish’d in the womb of *pia mater*, and delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am thankful for it.

**NATH.**
==41== Sir, I praise the Lord for you, and so may my parishioners, for their sons are well tutor’d by you, and their daughters profit very greatly under you. You are a good member of the commonwealth.

**HOL.**
==42== *Mehercle*, if their sons be ingenious, they shall want no instruction; if their daughters be capable, I will put it to them: but *vir sapit qui pauca loquitur*. A soul feminine saluteth us.

*Enter Jaquenetta and the Clown Costard.*

**JAQ.**
==43== God give you good morrow, Master Person.

**HOL.**
==44== Master Person, quasi pers-one. And if one should be pierc’d, which is the one?

**COST.**
==45== Marry, Master Schoolmaster, he that is likel’est to a hogshead.

**HOL.**
==46== Of piercing a hogshead! A good lustre of conceit in a turf of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough for a swine: ’tis pretty; it is well.

**JAQ.**
==47== Good Master Person, be so good as read me this letter. It was given me by Costard, and sent me from Don Armado. I beseech you read it.

**HOL.**
==48== *Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra ruminat*, and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I may speak of thee as the traveler doth of Venice:
==49== *Venechia, Venechia,*
==50== *Che non te vede, che non te prechia.*
==51== Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! Who understandeth thee not, loves thee not. *Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa*. Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? Or rather, as Horace says in his—What, my soul, verses?

**NATH.**
==52== Ay, sir, and very learned.

**HOL.**
==53== Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; *lege, domine*.

**NATH.**
*(Reads.)*
==54== *“If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?*
==55== *Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed!*
==56== *Though to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll faithful prove;*
==57== *Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like osiers bowed.*
==58== *Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,*
==59== *Where all those pleasures live that art would comprehend.*
==60== *If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;*
==61== *Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,*
==62== *All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;*
==63== *Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire.*
==64== *Thy eye Jove’s lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,*
==65== *Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.*
==66== *Celestial as thou art, O, pardon love this wrong,*
==67== *That sings heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.”*

**HOL.**
==68== You find not the apostraphus, and so miss the accent. Let me supervise the canzonet.
*(He takes the letter.)*
==69== Here are only numbers ratified, but for the elegancy, facility, and golden cadence of poesy, *caret*. Ovidius Naso was the man. And why indeed “Naso,” but for smelling out the odoriferous flowers of fancy, the jerks of invention? *Imitari* is nothing: so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper, the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin, was this directed to you?

**JAQ.**
==70== Ay, sir, from one *Monsieur* Berowne, one of the strange queen’s lords.

**HOL.**
==71== I will overglance the superscript: “To the snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady Rosaline.” I will look again on the intellect of the letter, for the nomination of the party
*(Writing.)*
==72== to the person written unto: “Your ladyship’s in all desired employment, Berowne.” Sir Nathaniel, this Berowne is one of the votaries with the King, and here he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger queen’s, which accidentally, or by the way of progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my sweet, deliver this paper into the royal hand of the King; it may concern much. Stay not thy compliment; I forgive thy duty. *Adieu*.

**JAQ.**
==73== Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!

**COST.**
==74== Have with thee, my girl.

*Exit with Jaquenetta.*

**NATH.**
==75== Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very religiously; and as a certain father saith⁠—

**HOL.**
==76== Sir, tell not me of the father, I do fear colorable colors. But to return to the verses: did they please you, Sir Nathaniel?

**NATH.**
==77== Marvelous well for the pen.

**HOL.**
==78== I do dine today at the father’s of a certain pupil of mine, where, if (before repast) it shall please you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid child or pupil, undertake your *bien venuto*; where I will prove those verses to be very unlearned, neither savoring of poetry, wit, nor invention. I beseech your society.

**NATH.**
==79== And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is the happiness of life.

**HOL.**
==80== And certes the text most infallibly concludes it.
*(To Dull.)*
==81== Sir, I do invite you too, you shall not say me nay: *pauca verba*. Away, the gentles are at their game, and we will to our recreation.

*Exeunt.*
