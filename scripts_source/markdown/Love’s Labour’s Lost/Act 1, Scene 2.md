## Act 1, Scene 2
[[Act 1, Scene 1|← Act 1, Scene 1]] | [[Act 2, Scene 1|Act 2, Scene 1 →]]

*The King of Navarre’s park.*

*Enter Armado and Moth, his page.*

**ARM.**
==1== Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit grows melancholy?

**MOTH.**
==2== A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.

**ARM.**
==3== Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

**MOTH.**
==4== No, no, O Lord, sir, no.

**ARM.**
==5== How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my tender juvenal?

**MOTH.**
==6== By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough *signior*.

**ARM.**
==7== Why tough *signior*? Why tough *signior*?

**MOTH.**
==8== Why tender juvenal? Why tender juvenal?

**ARM.**
==9== I spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.

**MOTH.**
==10== And I tough *signior* as an appertinent title to your old time, which we may name tough.

**ARM.**
==11== Pretty and apt.

**MOTH.**
==12== How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? Or I apt, and my saying pretty?

**ARM.**
==13== Thou pretty, because little.

**MOTH.**
==14== Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?

**ARM.**
==15== And therefore apt, because quick.

**MOTH.**
==16== Speak you this in my praise, master?

**ARM.**
==17== In thy condign praise.

**MOTH.**
==18== I will praise an eel with the same praise.

**ARM.**
==19== What? That an eel is ingenious?

**MOTH.**
==20== That an eel is quick.

**ARM.**
==21== I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat’st my blood.

**MOTH.**
==22== I am answer’d, sir.

**ARM.**
==23== I love not to be cross’d.

**MOTH.**
*(Aside.)*
==24== He speaks the mere contrary, crosses love not him.

**ARM.**
==25== I have promised to study three years with the Duke.

**MOTH.**
==26== You may do it in an hour, sir.

**ARM.**
==27== Impossible.

**MOTH.**
==28== How many is one thrice told?

**ARM.**
==29== I am ill at reck’ning, it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

**MOTH.**
==30== You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.

**ARM.**
==31== I confess both, they are both the varnish of a complete man.

**MOTH.**
==32== Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.

**ARM.**
==33== It doth amount to one more than two.

**MOTH.**
==34== Which the base vulgar do call three.

**ARM.**
==35== True.

**MOTH.**
==36== Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is three studied ere ye’ll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put “years” to the word “three,” and study three years in two words, the dancing horse will tell you.

**ARM.**
==37== A most fine figure!

**MOTH.**
*(Aside.)*
==38== To prove you a cipher.

**ARM.**
==39== I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humor of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier for a new devis’d cur’sy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy: what great men have been in love?

**MOTH.**
==40== Hercules, master.

**ARM.**
==41== Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.

**MOTH.**
==42== Sampson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter; and he was in love.

**ARM.**
==43== O well-knit Sampson, strong-jointed Sampson! I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Sampson’s love, my dear Moth?

**MOTH.**
==44== A woman, master.

**ARM.**
==45== Of what complexion?

**MOTH.**
==46== Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.

**ARM.**
==47== Tell me precisely of what complexion.

**MOTH.**
==48== Of the sea-water green, sir.

**ARM.**
==49== Is that one of the four complexions?

**MOTH.**
==50== As I have read, sir, and the best of them too.

**ARM.**
==51== Green indeed is the color of lovers; but to have a love of that color, methinks Sampson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.

**MOTH.**
==52== It was so, sir, for she had a green wit.

**ARM.**
==53== My love is most immaculate white and red.

**MOTH.**
==54== Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask’d under such colors.

**ARM.**
==55== Define, define, well-educated infant.

**MOTH.**
==56== My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue assist me!

**ARM.**
==57== Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty and pathetical!

**MOTH.**
==58== *If she be made of white and red,*
==59== *Her faults will ne’er be known,*
==60== *For blush in cheeks by faults are bred,*
==61== *And fears by pale white shown:*
==62== *Then if she fear, or be to blame,*
==63== *By this you shall not know,*
==64== *For still her cheeks possess the same*
==65== *Which native she doth owe.*
==66== A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.

**ARM.**
==67== Is there not a ballet, boy, of the *King and the Beggar*?

**MOTH.**
==68== The world was very guilty of such a ballet some three ages since, but I think now ’tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.

**ARM.**
==69== I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example my digression by some mighty president. Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves well.

**MOTH.**
*(Aside.)*
==70== To be whipt; and yet a better love than my master.

**ARM.**
==71== Sing, boy, my spirit grows heavy in love.

**MOTH.**
==72== And that’s great marvel, loving a light wench.

**ARM.**
==73== I say, sing.

**MOTH.**
==74== Forbear till this company be past.

*Enter Clown Costard, Constable Dull, and Wench Jaquenetta.*

**DULL.**
==75== Sir, the Duke’s pleasure is that you keep Costard safe, and you must suffer him to take no delight nor no penance, but ’a must fast three days a week. For this damsel, I must keep her at the park; she is allow’d for the dey-woman. Fare you well.

**ARM.**
==76== I do betray myself with blushing. Maid.

**JAQ.**
==77== Man.

**ARM.**
==78== I will visit thee at the lodge.

**JAQ.**
==79== That’s hereby.

**ARM.**
==80== I know where it is situate.

**JAQ.**
==81== Lord, how wise you are!

**ARM.**
==82== I will tell thee wonders.

**JAQ.**
==83== With that face?

**ARM.**
==84== I love thee.

**JAQ.**
==85== So I heard you say.

**ARM.**
==86== And so farewell.

**JAQ.**
==87== Fair weather after you!

**DULL.**
==88== Come, Jaquenetta, away.

*Exeunt Dull and Jaquenetta.*

**ARM.**
==89== Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offenses ere thou be pardoned.

**COST.**
==90== Well, sir, I hope when I do it I shall do it on a full stomach.

**ARM.**
==91== Thou shalt be heavily punished.

**COST.**
==92== I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they are but lightly rewarded.

**ARM.**
==93== Take away this villain, shut him up.

**MOTH.**
==94== Come, you transgressing slave, away.

**COST.**
==95== Let me not be pent up, sir; I will fast, being loose.

**MOTH.**
==96== No, sir, that were fast and loose; thou shalt to prison.

**COST.**
==97== Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation that I have seen, some shall see.

**MOTH.**
==98== What shall some see?

**COST.**
==99== Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their words, and therefore I will say nothing. I thank God I have as little patience as another man, and therefore I can be quiet.

*Exit with Moth.*

**ARM.**
==100== I do affect the very ground (which is base) where her shoe (which is baser) guided by her foot (which is basest) doth tread. I shall be forsworn (which is a great argument of falsehood) if I love. And how can that be true love, which is falsely attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil; there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Sampson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Salomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club, and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier. The first and second cause will not serve my turn; the *passado* he respects not, the *duello* he regards not: his disgrace is to be called boy, but his glory is to subdue men. *Adieu*, valor, rust, rapier, be still, drum, for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit, write, pen, for I am for whole volumes in folio.

*Exit.*
